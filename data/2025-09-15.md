### [1] [Human-AI Collaboration Increases Efficiency in Regulatory Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09738)
*Umut Eser,Yael Gozin,L. Jay Stallons,Ari Caroline,Martin Preusse,Brandon Rice,Scott Wright,Andrew Robertson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates AutoIND, a large language model platform, which reduced IND drafting time by around 97% while maintaining decent quality with no critical regulatory errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and expertise-dependence associated with preparing IND applications, which slows down early clinical development.

Method: The study assessed AutoIND’s performance in generating first drafts of IND nonclinical summaries. Drafting times and quality were measured against industry-standard benchmarks and evaluated using predefined quality criteria.

Result: AutoIND reduced drafting times significantly (from ~100 hours to 2.6–3.7 hours) and scored 69.6%–77.9% in quality evaluation, with noted deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity.

Conclusion: AutoIND speeds up IND drafting considerably but requires expert intervention for high-quality final submissions. Identified deficiencies provide directions for improving the model.

Abstract: Background: Investigational New Drug (IND) application preparation is
time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development.
Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND)
can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in
regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written
summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly
recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously
cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory
writers ($\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was
assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified
categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,
redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a
percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or
omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,
omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced
initial drafting time by $\sim$97% (from $\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870
pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).
Quality scores were 69.6\% and 77.9\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical
regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and
clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND
drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to
submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap
for targeted model improvements.

### [2] [Executable Ontologies: Synthesizing Event Semantics with Dataflow Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09775)
*Aleksandr Boldachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces boldsea, a semantic-event approach with executable ontologies modeling dynamic systems, enabling runtime modifications and merging data with business logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BPM systems and semantic technologies face limitations in effectively integrating data processing with dynamic business processes; addressing these gaps is critical.

Method: Developed the BSL language (formal grammar included), and outlined the boldsea-engine architecture enabling runtime-executable semantic models without compilation.

Result: The approach allows dynamic event models to be modified at runtime, offers temporal transparency, and integrates data and business logic within a unified framework.

Conclusion: Integrating event semantics with a dataflow architecture provides a powerful alternative to traditional BPM and semantic systems, enhancing flexibility and system integration.

Abstract: This paper presents boldsea, Boldachev's semantic-event approach -- an
architecture for modeling complex dynamic systems using executable ontologies
-- semantic models that act as dynamic structures, directly controlling process
execution. We demonstrate that integrating event semantics with a dataflow
architecture addresses the limitations of traditional Business Process
Management (BPM) systems and object-oriented semantic technologies. The paper
presents the formal BSL (boldsea Semantic Language), including its BNF grammar,
and outlines the boldsea-engine's architecture, which directly interprets
semantic models as executable algorithms without compilation. It enables the
modification of event models at runtime, ensures temporal transparency, and
seamlessly merges data and business logic within a unified semantic framework.

### [3] [How well can LLMs provide planning feedback in grounded environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09790)
*Yuxuan Li,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language and vision-language models can assist planning in different environments by providing various types of feedback and evaluates their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to reduce reliance on reward design and annotated demonstrations in grounded environments by leveraging the inherent knowledge in pretrained foundation models like LLMs and VLMs for planning tasks.

Method: The paper examines the feedback provided by LLMs and VLMs in symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. It analyzes various feedback types (binary, preference, action advising, etc.) and inference methods (in-context learning, chain-of-thought, environment dynamics) to gauge their influence.

Result: Foundation models deliver diverse, high-quality feedback that is particularly enhanced in larger and reasoning-optimized architectures. Enhanced inference methods also improve feedback consistency.

Conclusion: While foundation models are effective for feedback-driven planning, their performance diminishes in environments with complex dynamics or continuous state/action spaces.

Abstract: Learning to plan in grounded environments typically requires carefully
designed reward functions or high-quality annotated demonstrations. Recent
works show that pretrained foundation models, such as large language models
(LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), capture background knowledge helpful
for planning, which reduces the amount of reward design and demonstrations
needed for policy learning. We evaluate how well LLMs and VLMs provide feedback
across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. We consider
prominent types of feedback for planning including binary feedback, preference
feedback, action advising, goal advising, and delta action feedback. We also
consider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including
in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics. We
find that foundation models can provide diverse high-quality feedback across
domains. Moreover, larger and reasoning models consistently provide more
accurate feedback, exhibit less bias, and benefit more from enhanced inference
methods. Finally, feedback quality degrades for environments with complex
dynamics or continuous state spaces and action spaces.

### [4] [A Modular and Multimodal Generative AI Framework for Urban Building Energy Data: Generating Synthetic Homes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09794)
*Jackson Eshbaugh,Chetan Tiwari,Jorge Silveyra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular multimodal framework using generative AI to produce data for energy modeling from public residential information and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy modeling research faces challenges in acquiring inaccessible, expensive, or privacy-sensitive data.

Method: Developed a modular multimodal framework leveraging generative AI to generate realistic labeled data from accessible sources, and provided a pipeline to evaluate the framework's generative AI components.

Result: The framework generates realistic data while avoiding common issues of generative models, making it more accessible and reproducible.

Conclusion: The framework helps reduce reliance on costly or restricted data sources, advancing energy modeling research accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Computational models have emerged as powerful tools for energy modeling
research, touting scalability and quantitative results. However, these models
require a plethora of data, some of which is inaccessible, expensive, or raises
privacy concerns. We introduce a modular multimodal framework to produce this
data from publicly accessible residential information and images using
generative artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we provide a pipeline
demonstrating this framework, and we evaluate its generative AI components. Our
experiments show that our framework's use of AI avoids common issues with
generative models. Our framework produces realistic, labeled data. By reducing
dependence on costly or restricted data sources, we pave a path towards more
accessible and reproducible research.

### [5] [Towards a Common Framework for Autoformalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09810)
*Agnieszka Mensfelt,David Tena Cucala,Santiago Franco,Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki,Vince Trencsenyi,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews the developments in autoformalization, where informal input is translated into formal logical representations, and proposes a unified framework to integrate various research efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the fragmented progress in autoformalization across different fields, which hinders common methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks necessary for advancement.

Method: The authors analyze previous and current instances of autoformalization, explicitly or implicitly, to identify overlap. They propose a unified framework to encourage collaboration and consistency across fields.

Result: The paper identifies parallel developments in autoformalization and presents a framework that facilitates integration of methodologies and benchmarks across domains.

Conclusion: Integration of research efforts through a unified framework is essential to accelerate the progress of AI systems that can automatically formalize informal representations into logical forms.

Abstract: Autoformalization has emerged as a term referring to the automation of
formalization - specifically, the formalization of mathematics using
interactive theorem provers (proof assistants). Its rapid development has been
driven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs).
More recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader
task of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the
same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal
language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge
representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as
autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely
independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for
shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could
accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit
- instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a
unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to
advance the development of next generation AI systems.

### [6] [Towards an AI-based knowledge assistant for goat farmers based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09848)
*Nana Han,Dong Liu,Tomas Norton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an intelligent knowledge assistant for farmed goat health management by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and structured knowledge processing methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the increasing need for effective knowledge communication in livestock farming using LLMs, despite challenges such as the complexity, variety, and limited accessibility of knowledge sources.

Method: The study leverages RAG and two structured knowledge processing methods—table textualization and decision-tree textualization—to create a domain-specific knowledge base across five domains, supported by an online search module for real-time data retrieval.

Result: The system achieved mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set and 84.22% on the test set in knowledge fusion tasks. Q&A accuracies exceeded 85% across different formats, demonstrating the effectiveness of the structured fusion approach.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates reliability and practicality for goat farming applications, although there are opportunities for improvement in retrieval coverage and error mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being recognised as valuable
knowledge communication tools in many industries. However, their application in
livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not
least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This
study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support
health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table
textualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large
language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on
these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to
improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base
spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management,
Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge.
Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time
retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six
ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each
component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method
achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set
and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree
based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the
effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error
analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting
opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In
conclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the
proposed system for practical applications in goat farming.

### [7] [LLMs as Agentic Cooperative Players in Multiplayer UNO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09867)
*Yago Romano Matinez,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist humans effectively in accomplishing goals by testing their performance in the turn-based card game UNO, aiming not to win but to help another player win.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent to which LLMs can act as active participants and provide meaningful assistance across diverse tasks.

Method: A specific setup was developed where decoder-only LLMs are used as agents in the RLCard game environment, given full game-state information and prompted under two different strategies. Models of varying scales (1B to 70B parameters) were evaluated.

Result: All models performed better than a random baseline in UNO gameplay, but few demonstrated a significant ability to aid another player effectively.

Conclusion: LLMs can outperform random baselines in structured games, but their capacity to assist another player actively and significantly is limited.

Abstract: LLMs promise to assist humans -- not just by answering questions, but by
offering useful guidance across a wide range of tasks. But how far does that
assistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone
accomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by
engaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but
instead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only
LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models
receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under
two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B
parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts
performance. We find that while all models were able to successfully outperform
a random baseline when playing UNO, few were able to significantly aid another
player.

### [8] [The (R)evolution of Scientific Workflows in the Agentic AI Era: Towards Autonomous Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09915)
*Woong Shin,Renan Souza,Daniel Rosendo,Frédéric Suter,Feiyi Wang,Prasanna Balaprakash,Rafael Ferreira da Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses leveraging AI agents to evolve scientific workflows by enhancing intelligence and composition, aiming to accelerate discovery and enable autonomous laboratories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers currently spend significant time as manual workflow coordinators due to the complexity of distributed facilities and heterogeneous resources, highlighting the need for smarter and more autonomous systems.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual framework with two evolutionary dimensions: intelligence (static to intelligent) and composition (single to swarm), coupled with a detailed architectural blueprint for autonomous scientific workflows.

Result: The framework outlines a potential pathway to transition from current workflow systems to intelligent and distributed laboratories, showcasing opportunities for up to 100x acceleration in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Autonomous workflows powered by AI could transform scientific discovery processes, enabling significantly faster discoveries and new paradigms in laboratory automation.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly requires coordinating distributed
facilities and heterogeneous resources, forcing researchers to act as manual
workflow coordinators rather than scientists. Advances in AI leading to AI
agents show exciting new opportunities that can accelerate scientific discovery
by providing intelligence as a component in the ecosystem. However, it is
unclear how this new capability would materialize and integrate in the real
world. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework where workflows
evolve along two dimensions which are intelligence (from static to intelligent)
and composition (from single to swarm) to chart an evolutionary path from
current workflow management systems to fully autonomous, distributed scientific
laboratories. With these trajectories in mind, we present an architectural
blueprint that can help the community take the next steps towards harnessing
the opportunities in autonomous science with the potential for 100x discovery
acceleration and transformational scientific workflows.

### [9] [A Markovian Framing of WaveFunctionCollapse for Procedurally Generating Aesthetically Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09919)
*Franklin Yiu,Mohan Lu,Nina Li,Kevin Joseph,Tianxu Zhang,Julian Togelius,Timothy Merino,Sam Earle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach that reformulates WaveFunctionCollapse as a Markov Decision Process to better satisfy designer objectives and constraints in procedural content generation. Empirical results show this method outperforms traditional evolutionary approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in procedural content generation where satisfying constraints and designer-specified objectives simultaneously is complex, particularly as task difficulty increases.

Method: The authors reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse into a Markov Decision Process, allowing external optimization algorithms to focus on maximizing objectives while utilizing WFC's propagation mechanism for constraint enforcement.

Result: Experiments across various domains indicate that the WFC-MDP approach consistently outperforms traditional joint optimization methods, particularly for complex tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling local constraint satisfaction from global objective optimization using the WFC-MDP framework enhances performance and scalability in procedural content generation tasks.

Abstract: Procedural content generation often requires satisfying both
designer-specified objectives and adjacency constraints implicitly imposed by
the underlying tile set. To address the challenges of jointly optimizing both
constraints and objectives, we reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling external optimization algorithms to
focus exclusively on objective maximization while leveraging WFC's propagation
mechanism to enforce constraint satisfaction. We empirically compare optimizing
this MDP to traditional evolutionary approaches that jointly optimize global
metrics and local tile placement. Across multiple domains with various
difficulties, we find that joint optimization not only struggles as task
complexity increases, but consistently underperforms relative to optimization
over the WFC-MDP, underscoring the advantages of decoupling local constraint
satisfaction from global objective optimization.

### [10] [Evaluation of Black-Box XAI Approaches for Predictors of Values of Boolean Formulae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09982)
*Stav Armoni-Friedmann,Hana Chockler,David A. Kelly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes a precise causality-based measure to evaluate XAI tools and introduces a new tool, B-ReX, outperforming alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating explainable AI (XAI) approaches on tabular data in predicting Boolean functions.

Method: The authors developed a formal causality-based importance measure and compared advanced XAI tools using this benchmark. They also introduced B-ReX as an improvement of the existing ReX tool.

Result: B-ReX outperformed other black-box XAI tools in benchmarks, achieving a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 ± 0.012 on Boolean formulae.

Conclusion: B-ReX and causality-based measures enhance the evaluation of XAI tools, pushing advancements in the domain.

Abstract: Evaluating explainable AI (XAI) approaches is a challenging task in general,
due to the subjectivity of explanations. In this paper, we focus on tabular
data and the specific use case of AI models predicting the values of Boolean
functions. We extend the previous work in this domain by proposing a formal and
precise measure of importance of variables based on actual causality, and we
evaluate state-of-the-art XAI tools against this measure. We also present a
novel XAI tool B-ReX, based on the existing tool ReX, and demonstrate that it
is superior to other black-box XAI tools on a large-scale benchmark.
Specifically, B-ReX achieves a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 $\pm$ 0.012
on random 10-valued Boolean formulae

### [11] [GAMA: A General Anonymizing Multi-Agent System for Privacy Preservation Enhanced by Domain Rules and Disproof Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10018)
*Hailong Yang,Renhuo Zhao,Guanjin Wang,Zhaohong Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAMA, a system that allows multi-agent LLM applications to ensure privacy by dividing tasks into private and public spaces while addressing semantic loss through two modules. It demonstrates superior task performance and effective privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems are limited when handling tasks involving private data, as many LLMs are in public, insecure environments. This paper aims to address privacy concerns while maintaining task efficacy.

Method: The authors propose GAMA, which separates workspaces into private (for sensitive data) and public (for anonymized data). GAMA mitigates semantic loss via Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE) modules. It is evaluated using both public QA datasets and custom privacy datasets.

Result: Experimental results show that GAMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both task performance and privacy preservation, according to assessments on public and specifically designed datasets.

Conclusion: The GAMA system is highly effective for privacy-preserving multi-agent applications, ensuring robust task performance and addressing privacy in complex scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM), LLM-based agents
exhibit exceptional abilities in understanding and generating natural language,
facilitating human-like collaboration and information transmission in LLM-based
Multi-Agent System (MAS). High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote
servers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely
utilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To
address this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system
(GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and
protects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space,
agents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data
is utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused
by anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and
Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public
question-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The
results demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art models. To further assess its privacy-preserving capabilities,
we designed two new datasets: Knowledge Privacy Preservation and Logic Privacy
Preservation. The final results highlight GAMA's exceptional effectiveness in
both task processing and privacy preservation.

### [12] [XAgents: A Unified Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation via IF-THEN Rules and Multipolar Task Processing Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10054)
*Hailong Yang,Mingxian Gu,Jianqi Wang,Guanjin Wang,Zhaohong Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces XAgents, a cooperative multi-agent framework designed to improve task planning and execution in complex, uncertain scenarios. It uses a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules to achieve better collaboration and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges of effective task planning and execution in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when dealing with complex tasks that include uncertainty, which often results in errors and hinders task completion.

Method: The proposed method involves developing 'XAgents,' a framework based on a multipolar task processing graph for dynamic task planning, and IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors and enhance inter-agent collaboration during subtask processing.

Result: XAgents were tested on three different datasets and outperformed both single-agent and state-of-the-art multi-agent systems in solving knowledge-based and logic-based question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: The XAgents framework demonstrates superiority in task planning and execution compared to existing solutions, addressing task uncertainty while providing a scalable and collaborative approach for complex tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in supporting humans
with complex, real-world tasks. However, MAS still face challenges in effective
task planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often
resulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To
address this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework
built on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the
multipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle
task uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific
IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance
inter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three
distinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both
knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks. The codes for XAgents
are available at: https://github.com/AGI-FHBC/XAgents.

### [13] [AI Harmonics: a human-centric and harms severity-adaptive AI risk assessment framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10104)
*Sofia Vei,Paolo Giudici,Pavlos Sermpezis,Athena Vakali,Adelaide Emma Bernardelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AI Harmonics, a human-centric framework for assessing AI-related societal risks, emphasizing data-driven prioritization of significant harm types like political and physical risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing AI risk models, which often overlook diverse stakeholder perspectives and fail to capture real-world consequences.

Method: The paper proposes the AI Harmonics framework, which includes the AI Harm assessment metric (AIH). This metric uses ordinal severity data to evaluate relative impacts without requiring precise numerical estimates.

Result: Experimental analysis on annotated incident data indicates that political and physical harms are the most concentrated categories, highlighting their critical importance. Political harms affect public trust, while physical harms pose life-threatening risks.

Conclusion: The AI Harmonics framework is effective at identifying uneven harm distributions, allowing policymakers and organizations to align their mitigation efforts with the most pressing risks.

Abstract: The absolute dominance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces
unprecedented societal harms and risks. Existing AI risk assessment models
focus on internal compliance, often neglecting diverse stakeholder perspectives
and real-world consequences. We propose a paradigm shift to a human-centric,
harm-severity adaptive approach grounded in empirical incident data. We present
AI Harmonics, which includes a novel AI harm assessment metric (AIH) that
leverages ordinal severity data to capture relative impact without requiring
precise numerical estimates. AI Harmonics combines a robust, generalized
methodology with a data-driven, stakeholder-aware framework for exploring and
prioritizing AI harms. Experiments on annotated incident data confirm that
political and physical harms exhibit the highest concentration and thus warrant
urgent mitigation: political harms erode public trust, while physical harms
pose serious, even life-threatening risks, underscoring the real-world
relevance of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate that AI Harmonics
consistently identifies uneven harm distributions, enabling policymakers and
organizations to target their mitigation efforts effectively.

*Nenad Tomasev,Matija Franklin,Joel Z. Leibo,Julian Jacobs,William A. Cunningham,Iason Gabriel,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of a 'sandbox economy' to study emerging AI agent-driven economic systems, outlining their risks and proposing design choices for safe and beneficial implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for frameworks and mechanisms to analyze and guide the rapid emergence and impact of autonomous AI-agent economies on broader economic systems.

Method: Proposes the 'sandbox economy' framework, categorizing AI economies by origin and integration, and suggests design mechanisms like auction systems, 'mission economies,' and socio-technical infrastructures.

Result: Identifies opportunities for coordination and challenges such as economic risks, inequality, and trust issues in AI-driven economies, and highlights potential mechanisms for resolving these problems.

Conclusion: Advocates for the proactive design of AI agent market systems to manage risks and ensure these technologies foster collective human flourishing in the long term.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic
layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct
human oversight. We propose the "sandbox economy" as a framework for analyzing
this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins
(emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established
human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward
a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy,
presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as
well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and
exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices
that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider
auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the
design of AI "mission economies" to coordinate around achieving collective
goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and
accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable
agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's
long-term collective flourishing.

*Tamir Shazman,Idan Lev-Yehudi,Ron Benchetit,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), a novel online planning algorithm for Robust MDPs, suitable for real-time use and offering theoretical performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of model uncertainty and approximation errors in sample-based online planning for Markov Decision Processes.

Method: RSS computes robust value functions using Sample Average Approximation (SAA), ensuring tractable policy computation in environments with uncertain dynamics.

Result: RSS outperforms standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics, and provides finite-sample theoretical performance guarantees.

Conclusion: RSS advances online planning in MDPs by combining computational efficiency and robustness, making it applicable to real-time settings and large-scale problems with model uncertainty.

Abstract: Online planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) enables agents to make
sequential decisions by simulating future trajectories from the current state,
making it well-suited for large-scale or dynamic environments. Sample-based
methods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely
adopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative
model. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned
from limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade
performance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust
MDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,
yet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited
for real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the
first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical
performance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal
value function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the
efficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA),
enabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings. RSS is
applicable to infinite or continuous state spaces, and its sample and
computational complexities are independent of the state space size. We provide
theoretical performance guarantees and empirically show that RSS outperforms
standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework using LLM-based agents for automating the characterization of porous materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing porous materials has challenges in simulation setup and force field selection, which slow down materials discovery.

Method: The paper presents a multi-agent system leveraging LLM-based agents for automated literature-based force field extraction and RASPA simulation setup.

Result: Initial evaluations reveal high correctness and reproducibility in the approach, emphasizing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates promise for enabling fully autonomous and scalable materials characterization in the future.

Abstract: Automated characterization of porous materials has the potential to
accelerate materials discovery, but it remains limited by the complexity of
simulation setup and force field selection. We propose a multi-agent framework
in which LLM-based agents can autonomously understand a characterization task,
plan appropriate simulations, assemble relevant force fields, execute them and
interpret their results to guide subsequent steps. As a first step toward this
vision, we present a multi-agent system for literature-informed force field
extraction and automated RASPA simulation setup. Initial evaluations
demonstrate high correctness and reproducibility, highlighting this approach's
potential to enable fully autonomous, scalable materials characterization.

### [17] [Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10222)
*Maël Jullien,Lei Xu,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARENLI, a system that improves clinical natural language inference (NLI) by compartmentalizing reasoning tasks and ensuring auditable procedures, achieving significant fidelity improvements with large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in structured and generalizable internal representations of large language models when applied to clinical NLI tasks, focusing on improving inference reliability and safety.

Method: CARENLI systematically routes NLI tasks to specific reasoning solvers, complemented by a planner, verifier, and refiner for procedural auditing and error correction.

Result: CARENLI enhances inference accuracy by up to 42 points, achieves top performance metrics across specific reasoning families, and identifies the main bottleneck in routing tasks for family classification.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates CARENLI's capacity to improve LLM reasoning reliability in clinical contexts and establishes a framework for safer, auditable decision-making in complex language tasks.

Abstract: A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields
increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate
this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a
benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction,
and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI
that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each
premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable
procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner.
  Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching
98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag
violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial
share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying
family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs
often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is
underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a
framework for safer, auditable reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving reasoning task performance in small language models (SLMs) by incorporating formal methods and logical languages instead of natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address reasoning limitations of language models, which negatively impact tasks like ontology engineering.

Method: The authors conducted experiments to evaluate how different grammars (logical vs. natural language) used in expressing reasoning problems influence SLM performance.

Result: The study found that using a compact logical language as a substitute for natural language maintained strong SLM performance on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The results highlight the potential for refining SLMs' application in ontology engineering through the adoption of formal methods and logical languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) have failed to mask their
shortcomings particularly in the domain of reasoning. This limitation impacts
several tasks, most notably those involving ontology engineering. As part of a
PhD research, we investigate the consequences of incorporating formal methods
on the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) on reasoning tasks.
Specifically, we aim to orient our work toward using SLMs to bootstrap ontology
construction and set up a series of preliminary experiments to determine the
impact of expressing logical problems with different grammars on the
performance of SLMs on a predefined reasoning task. Our findings show that it
is possible to substitute Natural Language (NL) with a more compact logical
language while maintaining a strong performance on reasoning tasks and hope to
use these results to further refine the role of SLMs in ontology engineering.

### [19] [The Morality of Probability: How Implicit Moral Biases in LLMs May Shape the Future of Human-AI Symbiosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10297)
*Eoin O'Doherty,Nicole Weinrauch,Andrew Talone,Uri Klempner,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the moral preferences and biases in leading large language models (LLMs) when facing dilemmas, highlighting consistent value biases and emphasizing the importance of explainability and cultural awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address how AI decision-making aligns with human moral values and explores the underlying biases in state-of-the-art LLMs.

Method: A quantitative experiment with six culturally distinct LLMs was conducted, scoring their responses across 18 moral dilemmas and analyzing differences in outcomes influenced by model architecture and cultural origin.

Result: The findings reveal consistent value biases, with Care and Virtue being rated most moral while libertarian choices are penalized. Reasoning-enabled models were more context-sensitive and provided richer explanations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of explainability and cultural awareness in LLMs’ design for a more aligned and transparent symbiosis between humans and AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a pace that raises urgent
questions about how to align machine decision-making with human moral values.
This working paper investigates how leading AI systems prioritize moral
outcomes and what this reveals about the prospects for human-AI symbiosis. We
address two central questions: (1) What moral values do state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) implicitly favour when confronted with dilemmas? (2) How
do differences in model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability
affect these moral preferences? To explore these questions, we conduct a
quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18
dilemmas representing five moral frameworks. Our findings uncover strikingly
consistent value biases. Across all models, Care and Virtue values outcomes
were rated most moral, while libertarian choices were consistently penalized.
Reasoning-enabled models exhibited greater sensitivity to context and provided
richer explanations, whereas non-reasoning models produced more uniform but
opaque judgments. This research makes three contributions: (i) Empirically, it
delivers a large-scale comparison of moral reasoning across culturally distinct
LLMs; (ii) Theoretically, it links probabilistic model behaviour with
underlying value encodings; (iii) Practically, it highlights the need for
explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI
toward a transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future.

### [20] [State Algebra for Propositional Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10326)
*Dmitry Lesnik,Tobias Schäfer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: State Algebra is a novel framework for propositional logic manipulation using algebraic methods with flexible representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible and algebraically robust framework to manipulate and represent propositional logic.

Method: The system uses three hierarchical representations and emphasizes the trade-off between canonical forms and flexibility. It also explores extensions to probabilistic logic and related computations.

Result: Developed a framework that provides tools for search-based algorithms, knowledge compilation, and probabilistic logic applications with non-canonical but flexible reductions.

Conclusion: State Algebra demonstrates versatility by trading canonicity for flexibility, aiding problem representation and extending capabilities in computational logic.

Abstract: This paper presents State Algebra, a novel framework designed to represent
and manipulate propositional logic using algebraic methods. The framework is
structured as a hierarchy of three representations: Set, Coordinate, and Row
Decomposition. These representations anchor the system in well-known semantics
while facilitating the computation using a powerful algebraic engine. A key
aspect of State Algebra is its flexibility in representation. We show that
although the default reduction of a state vector is not canonical, a unique
canonical form can be obtained by applying a fixed variable order during the
reduction process. This highlights a trade-off: by foregoing guaranteed
canonicity, the framework gains increased flexibility, potentially leading to
more compact representations of certain classes of problems. We explore how
this framework provides tools to articulate both search-based and knowledge
compilation algorithms and discuss its natural extension to probabilistic logic
and Weighted Model Counting.

### [21] [Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401)
*Alva West,Yixuan Weng,Minjun Zhu,Zhen Lin,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Failure attribution methods in multi-agent systems struggle with low accuracy due to lack of counterfactual reasoning. The paper introduces Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, achieving improved step-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current failure attribution approaches are limited by their inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning, resulting in low accuracy and impractical debugging processes for complex systems.

Method: The Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding method guides large language models through a structured three-step causal inference: Abduction (inferring root causes), Action (defining corrective interventions), and Prediction (simulating outcomes).

Result: A2P Scaffolding significantly improves step-level accuracy in failure attribution tasks, achieving 47.46% accuracy on algorithm-generated datasets (2.85× improvement) and 29.31% accuracy on more complex hand-crafted datasets (2.43× improvement).

Conclusion: By introducing causal reasoning, A2P Scaffolding offers a more robust and accurate framework for automated failure attribution in multi-agent systems, overcoming limitations of pattern-based methods.

Abstract: Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step
where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current
methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,
leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them
impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental
inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if
correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To
bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)
Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from
pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly
guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process
within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes
behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective
intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and
verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach
leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a
rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the
Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated
dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement
over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it
achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's
12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding
provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for
automated failure attribution.

### [22] [Mutual Information Tracks Policy Coherence in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10423)
*Cameron Reid,Wael Hafez,Amirhossein Nazeri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for diagnosing anomalies in reinforcement learning (RL) agents during deployment, using mutual information patterns as key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL agents face issues such as sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental changes, yet lack inherent mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures.

Method: The authors analyze mutual information patterns in state-action dynamics, observing changes during learning stages and testing controlled perturbations to identify faults in state or action spaces.

Result: They find that state-action mutual information grows during successful learning, and specific diagnostic information metrics can precisely localize system faults without degrading performance or modifying architectures.

Conclusion: The study highlights mutual information patterns as signatures of learning and tools for diagnosing system health, paving the way for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and policy adjustments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face
degradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet
lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an
information-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of
RL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.
Through analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic
control task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits
characteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and
actions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing
state entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention
to task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint
mutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during
early learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a
transition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately
actionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system
failures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad
collapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action
coupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts
action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This
differential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation
experiments enables precise fault localization without architectural
modifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns
as both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the
foundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and
policy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to decompose mathematical kernels into primitives and benchmark them to analyze efficiency in hardware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient hardware accelerators for scientific applications require manual optimization, and understanding inefficiencies in automatic hardware design tools is a challenge.

Method: The authors hierarchically decompose mathematical kernels into primitives, implement these in different design environments, and analyze their achievable frequency and resource requirements.

Result: Fairer comparisons between automated and expert-crafted designs are made possible, helping identify inefficiencies in tools and offering actionable insights.

Conclusion: This work guides developers and designers toward better practices by analyzing and benchmarking hardware designs at both primitive and algorithmic levels.

Abstract: Developing efficient hardware accelerators for mathematical kernels used in
scientific applications and machine learning has traditionally been a
labor-intensive task. These accelerators typically require low-level
programming in Verilog or other hardware description languages, along with
significant manual optimization effort. Recently, to alleviate this challenge,
high-level hardware design tools like Chisel and High-Level Synthesis have
emerged. However, as with any compiler, some of the generated hardware may be
suboptimal compared to expert-crafted designs. Understanding where these
inefficiencies arise is crucial, as it provides valuable insights for both
users and tool developers. In this paper, we propose a methodology to
hierarchically decompose mathematical kernels - such as Fourier transforms,
matrix multiplication, and QR factorization - into a set of common building
blocks or primitives. Then the primitives are implemented in the different
programming environments, and the larger algorithms get assembled. Furthermore,
we employ an automatic approach to investigate the achievable frequency and
required resources. Performing this experimentation at each level will provide
fairer comparisons between designs and offer guidance for both tool developers
and hardware designers to adopt better practices.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents Finesse, an agile design framework for pairing-based cryptography that achieves significant performance improvements and design flexibility through hardware-software co-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PBC accelerators face challenges like long design cycles, poor balance between performance and flexibility, and limited architectural exploration.

Method: The authors propose Finesse, a co-design framework that integrates a specialized compiler and multi-granularity hardware simulator, enabling fast prototyping and effective exploration of design space.

Result: Finesse demonstrates a 34× improvement in throughput and a 6.2× gain in area efficiency compared to flexible frameworks, and outperforms rigid ASIC designs with 3× better throughput and 3.2× improved area efficiency.

Conclusion: Finesse significantly shortens design cycles and achieves a unique balance of flexibility and performance, making it highly effective for rapidly evolving PBC needs.

Abstract: Pairing-based cryptography (PBC) is crucial in modern cryptographic
applications. With the rapid advancement of adversarial research and the
growing diversity of application requirements, PBC accelerators need regular
updates in algorithms, parameter configurations, and hardware design. However,
traditional design methodologies face significant challenges, including
prolonged design cycles, difficulties in balancing performance and flexibility,
and insufficient support for potential architectural exploration.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Finesse, an agile design framework
based on co-design methodology. Finesse leverages a co-optimization cycle
driven by a specialized compiler and a multi-granularity hardware simulator,
enabling both optimized performance metrics and effective design space
exploration. Furthermore, Finesse adopts a modular design flow to significantly
shorten design cycles, while its versatile abstraction ensures flexibility
across various curve families and hardware architectures.
  Finesse offers flexibility, efficiency, and rapid prototyping, comparing with
previous frameworks. With compilation times reduced to minutes, Finesse enables
faster iteration cycles and streamlined hardware-software co-design.
Experiments on popular curves demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving
$34\times$ improvement in throughput and $6.2\times$ increase in area
efficiency compared to previous flexible frameworks, while outperforming
state-of-the-art non-flexible ASIC designs with a $3\times$ gain in throughput
and $3.2\times$ improvement in area efficiency.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes MCBP, a novel hardware-software co-design for accelerating LLM inference, addressing inefficiencies in computation and memory collaboratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from high inference latency due to inefficiencies in GEMM operations, weight access, and KV cache access, motivating the need for a versatile and efficient accelerator design.

Method: The method involves three innovations: BS-repetitiveness-enabled computation reduction (BRCR) for eliminating redundant GEMM calculations, BS-sparsity-enabled two-state coding (BSTC) for reducing weight access, and Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP) for minimizing KV cache access. These are supported by a custom hardware accelerator design.

Result: MCBP demonstrates a 9.43x speedup and 31.1x higher energy efficiency compared to Nvidia A100, and significantly outperforms other SOTA accelerators in energy savings.

Conclusion: MCBP successfully overcomes inefficiencies in computation and memory access for LLMs, offering substantial performance and energy efficiency improvements through bit-grained algorithm-hardware co-design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant inference latency due to
inefficiencies in GEMM operations, weight access, and KV cache access,
especially in real-time scenarios. This highlights the need for a versatile
compute-memory efficient accelerator. Unfortunately, existing Transformer
accelerators struggle to address both aspects simultaneously, as they focus on
value-level processing, missing fine-grained opportunities to optimize
computation and memory collaboratively. This paper introduces MCBP, a
bit-grained compute-memory efficient algorithm-hardware co-design that
leverages bit-slice (BS) enabled repetitiveness and sparsity to accelerate LLM
inference. MCBP features three key innovations: 1) BS-repetitiveness-enabled
computation reduction (BRCR), which eliminates redundant GEMM computations via
leveraging redundancy hidden among BS vectors; 2) BS-sparsity-enabled two-state
coding (BSTC), which reduces weight access via exploiting significant sparsity
in high-order bit-slice weight; 3) Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP),
which reduces KV cache access by leveraging early-termination-based bit-grained
prediction. These techniques, supported by custom accelerator designs,
effectively alleviate the burden in GEMM, weight access, and KV cache access.
Extensive experiments on 26 benchmarks show that MCBP achieves 9.43x speed up
and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia A100 GPU. Compared to SOTA
Transformer accelerators, MCBP achieves 35x, 5.2x and 3.2x energy saving than
Spatten, FACT and SOFA, respectively.

TL;DR: TurboFuzz is a hardware-accelerated framework on FPGA for processor verification, achieving higher coverage and faster performance compared to software-based fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processor complexity and emerging ISAs like RISC-V demand agile and efficient verification tools to address limitations in current simulation-based and hardware-accelerated solutions.

Method: TurboFuzz combines test generation, simulation, and coverage feedback in an FPGA-based framework, utilizing optimized test cases, inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzing.

Result: TurboFuzz exhibits up to 2.23x coverage improvement and 571x performance speedup over conventional software fuzzers under the same conditions.

Conclusion: TurboFuzz significantly enhances processor verification efficiency and visibility with moderate resource usage, addressing major shortcomings of existing methods.

Abstract: Verification is a critical process for ensuring the correctness of modern
processors. The increasing complexity of processor designs and the emergence of
new instruction set architectures (ISAs) like RISC-V have created demands for
more agile and efficient verification methodologies, particularly regarding
verification efficiency and faster coverage convergence. While simulation-based
approaches now attempt to incorporate advanced software testing techniques such
as fuzzing to improve coverage, they face significant limitations when applied
to processor verification, notably poor performance and inadequate test case
quality. Hardware-accelerated solutions using FPGA or ASIC platforms have tried
to address these issues, yet they struggle with challenges including host-FPGA
communication overhead, inefficient test pattern generation, and suboptimal
implementation of the entire multi-step verification process.
  In this paper, we present TurboFuzz, an end-to-end hardware-accelerated
verification framework that implements the entire Test
Generation-Simulation-Coverage Feedback loop on a single FPGA for modern
processor verification. TurboFuzz enhances test quality through optimized test
case (seed) control flow, efficient inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzer
integration, thereby improving coverage and execution efficiency. Additionally,
it employs a feedback-driven generation mechanism to accelerate coverage
convergence. Experimental results show that TurboFuzz achieves up to 2.23x more
coverage collection than software-based fuzzers within the same time budget,
and up to 571x performance speedup when detecting real-world issues, while
maintaining full visibility and debugging capabilities with moderate area
overhead.

*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Warren Del-Pinto,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) to represent clinical documents more effectively, improving automated ICD-9 coding performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating clinical document coding is vital for scalable extraction and structuring of clinical data, addressing challenges in manual coding such as difficulty and time consumption.

Method: The authors construct document-level knowledge graphs from clinical text to efficiently represent the input with reduced text data while maintaining information integrity, integrating this representation into the PLM-ICD architecture.

Result: The knowledge graph representation reduced input text length by 23% while retaining 90% of information and improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20% on ICD coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using structured knowledge graphs for clinical document representation enhances coding accuracy, training efficiency, and explainability compared to text-only methods.

Abstract: Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an
important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and
analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and
improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and
time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can
potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of
structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires
mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge
sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the
use of external resources for representing the input documents has been
underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the
input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that
provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting
knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with
23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess
the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it
into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments
yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while
improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types
of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved
explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a method to improve hallucination detection in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of LLMs is questioned due to their tendency to produce inaccurate outputs, known as hallucinations.

Method: CLAP processes LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence, enabling detection of hallucinated versus non-hallucinated responses.

Result: CLAP demonstrated improved hallucination detection across five LLMs and three tasks, including both greedily decoded and high-temperature sampled responses.

Conclusion: CLAP enhances the reliability of LLMs, enables fine-grained hallucination detection, supports a detect-then-mitigate strategy, and performs well even out-of-distribution.

Abstract: With the large-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
applications, there is a growing reliability concern due to their tendency to
generate inaccurate text, i.e. hallucinations. In this work, we propose
Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for
hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire
residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs
and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to
baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at
higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to
disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled
responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate
strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability
compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains
high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.

TL;DR: End-to-end speech-to-text translation often faces data scarcity, but leveraging Machine Translation data and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) with defined regularization approaches can improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in speech-to-text translation by incorporating effective use of existing Machine Translation (MT) data and regularization techniques.

Method: Employ consistency regularization across modalities and R-drop regularization within modalities in a Multi-Task Learning setup, complemented by MT loss coefficient adjustments. Introduce the regularization horizon concept for optimal tuning.

Result: Experiments on the MuST-C dataset reveal that careful tuning of hyperparameters within the defined regularization framework achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Strategic use of regularization techniques and MT loss adjustments in MTL can mitigate data scarcity and enhance speech-to-text translation performance.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-text translation typically suffers from the scarcity of
paired speech-text data. One way to overcome this shortcoming is to utilize the
bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task and perform Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In this paper, we formulate MTL from a regularization
perspective and explore how sequences can be regularized within and across
modalities. By thoroughly investigating the effect of consistency
regularization (different modality) and R-drop (same modality), we show how
they respectively contribute to the total regularization. We also demonstrate
that the coefficient of MT loss serves as another source of regularization in
the MTL setting. With these three sources of regularization, we introduce the
optimal regularization contour in the high-dimensional space, called the
regularization horizon. Experiments show that tuning the hyperparameters within
the regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the

### [30] [Creativity Benchmark: A benchmark for marketing creativity for LLM models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09702)
*Ninad Bhat,Kieran Browne,Pip Bingemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Creativity Benchmark, to assess creativity in large language models (LLMs), specifically in marketing domains. Using human evaluations, it finds limited variability in model performance across brands and highlights the importance of human judgments over automated methods for assessing creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of evaluating the creative capabilities of LLMs in marketing tasks, where measuring insight, originality, and wild creative ideas is vital.

Method: The benchmark evaluates LLMs on 100 brands across three prompt types and gathers human preferences through 11,012 comparisons. Bradley-Terry models assess performance clustering, and cosine distances analyze diversity. It compares human rankings with three LLM-as-judge setups.

Result: No single model performs consistently over all brands and prompt types. Human evaluations show clustered performance, and automated judgments exhibit weak correlations with human rankings, revealing judge-specific biases.

Conclusion: Results emphasize the need for expert human judgment and workflows that account for diversity, as automated evaluation methods and conventional creativity tests fall short in brand-specific creative tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language
models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12
categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human
pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised
comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered
performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the
top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head
win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about
$61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to
capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing.
Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak,
inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that
automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional
creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks.
Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and
diversity-aware workflows.

### [31] [CTCC: A Robust and Stealthy Fingerprinting Framework for Large Language Models via Cross-Turn Contextual Correlation Backdoor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09703)
*Zhenhua Xu,Xixiang Zhao,Xubin Yue,Shengwei Tian,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTCC, a fingerprinting framework for verifying LLM ownership using contextual correlations across dialogue turns, demonstrating superior stealth and robustness compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of large language models has raised concerns about intellectual property theft and unauthorized redistribution, necessitating methods for reliable ownership verification.

Method: A rule-driven fingerprinting framework called CTCC is introduced, encoding contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns instead of relying on single-token or single-turn triggers.

Result: Experimental results show CTCC achieves stronger stealth and robustness compared to existing fingerprinting approaches, even under black-box access situations.

Conclusion: CTCC offers a more dependable and practical method for ownership verification in LLMs, addressing challenges like false positives, fingerprint leakage, and resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has intensified
concerns around intellectual property (IP) protection, as model theft and
unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible. To address this,
model fingerprinting aims to embed verifiable ownership traces into LLMs.
However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between stealthness,
robustness, and generalizability, being either detectable via distributional
shifts, vulnerable to adversarial modifications, or easily invalidated once the
fingerprint is revealed. In this work, we introduce CTCC, a novel rule-driven
fingerprinting framework that encodes contextual correlations across multiple
dialogue turns, such as counterfactual, rather than relying on token-level or
single-turn triggers. CTCC enables fingerprint verification under black-box
access while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage, supporting
continuous construction under a shared semantic rule even if partial triggers
are exposed. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures
demonstrate that CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness
than prior work. Our findings position CTCC as a reliable and practical
solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. Our
code and data are publicly available at <https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/CTCC>.

*Ali Mazyaki,Mohammad Naghizadeh,Samaneh Ranjkhah Zonouzaghi,Hossein Setareh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if language models (LMs) display future- versus present-oriented preferences in decision-making and evaluates how these preferences can be influenced systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LMs can mimic human-like intertemporal preferences and align with diverse long-term goals through manipulation of time-oriented prompts.

Method: The paper adopts human experimental protocols to assess multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks, introduces an operational metric (MTO), and benchmarks LM preferences against human decision makers.

Result: Reasoning-oriented LMs show a bias towards future-oriented choices but partially align with individual or geographical identity preferences. They also internalize future-focused reasoning as AI decision-makers.

Conclusion: Design implications are proposed for AI assistants to better align with varied, long-term objectives. The study offers a research agenda on personalized calibration and socially aware AI deployment.

Abstract: We study whether language models (LMs) exhibit future- versus
present-oriented preferences in intertemporal choice and whether those
preferences can be systematically manipulated. Using adapted human experimental
protocols, we evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks and benchmark them
against a sample of human decision makers. We introduce an operational metric,
the Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO), defined as the change in an LM's
revealed time preference between future- and present-oriented prompts. In our
tests, reasoning-focused models (e.g., DeepSeek-Reasoner and grok-3-mini)
choose later options under future-oriented prompts but only partially
personalize decisions across identities or geographies. Moreover, models that
correctly reason about time orientation internalize a future orientation for
themselves as AI decision makers. We discuss design implications for AI
assistants that should align with heterogeneous, long-horizon goals and outline
a research agenda on personalized contextual calibration and socially aware
deployment.

### [33] [The Non-Determinism of Small LLMs: Evidence of Low Answer Consistency in Repetition Trials of Standard Multiple-Choice Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09705)
*Claudio Pinhanez,Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the consistency of small-sized language models (2B-8B parameters) in answering repeated questions, comparing model sizes, fine-tuning, and inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how reliable small LLMs are in providing consistent answers to repeated questions, which has implications for robustness and practical application.

Method: Analyzing the repeated responses of small and medium LLMs to multiple-choice questions from MMLU-Redux and MedQA, under varying conditions such as inference temperature and finetuning.

Result: Small LLMs demonstrate 50%-80% consistency at low inference temperatures, with accuracy correlating to consistency. Medium-sized models exhibit higher answer consistency.

Conclusion: While small models show varying levels of consistency, medium models deliver better consistency, highlighting trade-offs in employing LLMs for accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in
answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known,
open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the
multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different
inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base
models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring
multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in
deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we
propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number
of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models
but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference
temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably
correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to
indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

*Nirmalendu Prakash,Yeo Wei Jie,Amir Abdullah,Ranjan Satapathy,Erik Cambria,Roy Ka Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates harmful prompt refusal mechanisms in large language models using sparse autoencoders to identify causally-influential latent features, enabling jailbreak manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain a better understanding of safety behaviors, particularly refusal on harmful prompts in instruction-tuned large language models.

Method: The study uses a three-stage pipeline with sparse autoencoders: finding refusal direction, greedy filtering, and capturing nonlinear interactions with a factorization machine.

Result: Identifies latent features that mediate refusal behaviors, reveals redundancy in these features, and demonstrates causal modifications to model behavior.

Conclusion: The findings open opportunities for fine-grained auditing and interventions in model safety behaviors by manipulating the interpretable latent space.

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain
poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on
residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent
space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to
compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search
proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating
direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering:
prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization
machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active
features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of
jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of
refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant
unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential
for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by
manipulating the interpretable latent space.

*Jing Ren,Weiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces quantitative evaluation metrics for assessing ChatGPT's academic writing quality and proposes iterative prompting for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like fabricated references in ChatGPT-based academic writing and the limitations of subjective evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose two new metrics—content quality and reference validity—and use an iterative prompting approach based on these metrics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the metrics enable objective assessments and iterative prompting improves content quality while reducing inaccuracies and fabrications.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and approach enhance academic writing capabilities of ChatGPT while addressing ethical challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly used in academic
writing, yet issues such as incorrect or fabricated references raise ethical
concerns. Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on
subjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity,
potentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to
provide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing
capabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality
and reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores
derived from these two metrics. Our extensive experiments show that the
proposed metrics provide an objective, quantitative framework for assessing
ChatGPT's writing performance. Additionally, iterative prompting significantly
enhances content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and
fabrications, addressing critical ethical challenges in academic contexts.

### [36] [Generating Individual Travel Diaries Using Large Language Models Informed by Census and Land-Use Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09710)
*Sepehr Golrokh Amin,Devin Rhoads,Fatemeh Fakhrmoosavi,Nicholas E. Lownes,John N. Ivan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate travel diaries, demonstrating comparable or better realism than traditional methods while leveraging open data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generation of travel diaries without relying on proprietary survey data, using open-source data and evaluating the realism of generated synthetic diaries.

Method: Stochastic persona generation from open data, direct prompting of an LLM to synthesize travel diaries, and evaluation via realism scores validated with real-world data using metrics like Jensen-Shannon Divergence.

Result: LLM-generated diaries demonstrated overall realism comparable to traditional models, with superior performance in trip purpose determination and statistical representativeness, though classical models excelled in numerical trip count prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM approach is a viable zero-shot model for generating realistic travel diaries, offering an innovative path forward for synthetic diary evaluations.

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating
individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While
traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel
surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically
from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database
(SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study
features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip
Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against
the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across
demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When
compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for
trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the
validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM
mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and
demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while
classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity
duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical
representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot
viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future
synthetic diary evaluation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychiatryBench, a specialized benchmark based on expert-validated sources for evaluating LLMs in psychiatric tasks. It highlights LLMs' limitations in clinical consistency and safety, offering a modular framework to enhance LLM performance in mental health contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clinically valid resources for evaluating LLMs' performance in psychiatric applications.

Method: Developed PsychiatryBench, a benchmark drawn from authoritative psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench includes 11 question-answering tasks with over 5,300 expert-annotated items. Various LLMs were evaluated using conventional metrics and an LLM-as-judge similarity scoring framework.

Result: The evaluation revealed significant gaps in clinical consistency and safety, especially in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, showcasing the limitations of current LLMs in psychiatric reasoning.

Conclusion: PsychiatryBench provides a valuable platform to benchmark and improve LLM capabilities in high-stakes psychiatric scenarios, stressing the need for model tuning and better evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric
practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical
documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources
heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or
synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture
the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce
PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in
authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks.
PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from
diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up,
management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and
multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated
items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini,
DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models
(e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an
"LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial
gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up
and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and
more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible
platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental
health applications.

### [38] [The Thinking Therapist: Training Large Language Models to Deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Odds Ratio Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09712)
*Talha Tahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates methods to train small language models in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), finding that policy optimization outperforms fine-tuning, with reasoning steps offering conditional benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how small large language models can be trained effectively to deliver ACT therapy using innovative optimization techniques and reasoning strategies.

Method: They trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), both with and without a chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step, and assessed performance using ACT-FM and TES benchmarks evaluated by a fine-tuned LLM judge.

Result: ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed SFT and base Instruct models in ACT fidelity and therapeutic empathy metrics, while COT reasoning steps added value only for the SFT-trained models.

Conclusion: ORPO effectively teaches therapeutic 'process' rather than 'content,' making it superior for instilling ACT competencies in small LLMs, while COT reasoning's utility depends on the training method.

Abstract: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral
therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions.
This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit
reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to
deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by
Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each
with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance
was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base
Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions,
with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM)
and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned
on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models
significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT
fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) =
140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a
significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of
2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the
superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO
stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating
`content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for
models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that
preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies
in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent
on the underlying training paradigm.

*Duolin Sun,Dan Yang,Yue Shen,Yihan Jiao,Zhehao Tan,Jie Feng,Lianzhen Zhong,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HANRAG, a heuristic-based method designed to improve multi-hop query capabilities and reduce noise in retrieval-augmented generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods struggle with multi-hop queries due to inefficiencies like iterative retrieval and noise accumulation.

Method: HANRAG leverages a heuristic framework where queries are decomposed into sub-queries, noise is filtered from retrieved content, and a revelator routes queries efficiently.

Result: HANRAG outperforms industry-leading methods in benchmarks for both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: HANRAG enhances systems' adaptability and noise resistance, providing significant improvements in retrieval-augmented generation approaches.

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances question-answering
systems and dialogue generation tasks by integrating information retrieval (IR)
technologies with large language models (LLMs). This strategy, which retrieves
information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities
of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG
methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For
instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many
retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex
query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific
sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed,
it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we
introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently
tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG
routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from
retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise
resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare
the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various
benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior
performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

TL;DR: This study evaluates 18 different methods to measure semantic similarity in software engineering applications and highlights significant flaws in commonly used metrics. Large language models performed better in distinguishing semantic differences compared to embedding-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to ascertain the effectiveness of semantic similarity measurement techniques, which are vital for software engineering tasks such as code search and automated reviews, especially given the rise in use of large language models.

Method: The study systematically tested 18 methods, including word-based approaches, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms by applying controlled changes to text and code to assess their performance.

Result: The analysis uncovered critical issues with embedding methods, such as misidentifying semantic opposites as similar, and demonstrated the improved effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing semantic differences. Switching to cosine similarity significantly improved embedding methods' performance (by 24–66%).

Conclusion: LLMs proved superior in semantic similarity metric performance, particularly in differentiating opposite meanings, highlighting limitations in embedding techniques and the need for more robust measurement metrics.

Abstract: This research examines how well different methods measure semantic
similarity, which is important for various software engineering applications
such as code search, API recommendations, automated code reviews, and
refactoring tools. While large language models are increasingly used for these
similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand
semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.
  The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including
word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and
structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing
framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well
each method handles different types of semantic relationships.
  The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some
embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up
to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches
occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The
study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how
they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine
similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed
better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores
(0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods
that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.

*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes intrinsic properties causing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), using datasets to pinpoint these issues and find they persist even as model scales increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the intrinsic vulnerabilities in LLMs that lead to hallucinations, identifying key model properties responsible for this issue.

Method: The study evaluates hallucination rates using the HaluEval and TruthfulQA datasets, analyzing various question formats to determine the symbolic properties contributing to hallucination.

Result: The research shows high hallucination rates in Gemma models, with percentages reducing with model scale but still significantly influenced by symbolic properties like modifiers and named entities.

Conclusion: Symbolic elements remain a challenge for LLMs, indicating a fundamental processing weakness that persists even as models scale up.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem.
However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to
hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies
and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities
within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we
utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their
existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down
these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that
hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for
Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model
scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B,
reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination
rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of
hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially
evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities
(ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets.
These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models,
pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such
inputs--regardless of their scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALIGNS, a system leveraging large language models to build nomological networks for psychological measurement validation, addressing a 70-year-old problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nomological networks, essential for ensuring the validity of psychological measurements, remain a challenge decades after their proposal, which affects clinical trials and public policy effectiveness.

Method: The ALIGNS system was developed using large language models and validated questionnaire measures, generating extensive nomological networks covering over 550,000 indicators.

Result: The system demonstrated its utility through three evaluations, including identifying dimensions of emotional distress, uncovering new child temperament dimensions, and receiving positive expert feedback on its applicability.

Conclusion: ALIGNS represents a significant advancement in measurement validation, providing a freely available, large-scale solution that complements traditional methods.

Abstract: Psychological measurement is critical to many disciplines. Despite advances
in measurement, building nomological networks, theoretical maps of how concepts
and measures relate to establish validity, remains a challenge 70 years after
Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation. This limitation
has practical consequences: clinical trials may fail to detect treatment
effects, and public policy may target the wrong outcomes. We introduce Analysis
of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS), a large
language model-based system trained with validated questionnaire measures.
ALIGNS provides three comprehensive nomological networks containing over
550,000 indicators across psychology, medicine, social policy, and other
fields. This represents the first application of large language models to solve
a foundational problem in measurement validation. We report classification
accuracy tests used to develop the model, as well as three evaluations. In the
first evaluation, the widely used NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments
are shown to converge into a single dimension of emotional distress. The second
evaluation examines child temperament measures and identifies four potential
dimensions not captured by current frameworks, and questions one existing
dimension. The third evaluation, an applicability check, engages expert
psychometricians who assess the system's importance, accessibility, and
suitability. ALIGNS is freely available at nomologicalnetwork.org,
complementing traditional validation methods with large-scale nomological
analysis.

Motivation: Emerging technology opportunities are vital for driving advancements in technology and innovation, and identifying them requires efficient methodologies.

Method: The framework processes patent datasets, maps topic relationships, tracks their changes over time, employs large language models, and utilizes AI tools for enhanced topic extraction and analysis.

Result: The evaluation using U.S. Patent Office's AI patent dataset showed AI technology advancing towards everyday accessibility.

Conclusion: The approach confirms the framework's potential for identifying future technology directions effectively using patent data and advanced language models.

Abstract: Technology opportunities are critical information that serve as a foundation
for advancements in technology, industry, and innovation. This paper proposes a
framework based on the temporal relationships between technologies to identify
emerging technology opportunities. The proposed framework begins by extracting
text from a patent dataset, followed by mapping text-based topics to discover
inter-technology relationships. Technology opportunities are then identified by
tracking changes in these topics over time. To enhance efficiency, the
framework leverages a large language model to extract topics and employs a
prompt for a chat-based language model to support the discovery of technology
opportunities. The framework was evaluated using an artificial intelligence
patent dataset provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The
experimental results suggest that artificial intelligence technology is
evolving into forms that facilitate everyday accessibility. This approach
demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework to identify future
technology opportunities.

Method: The system uses a lightweight pipeline with minimal changes: (1) a two-stage retrieval-ranking process with domain-specific fine-tuning for ranking, (2) explicit span boundary cues using wrapped tags in the ranking stage, and (3) data augmentation by expanding the training corpus with three additional sources.

Result: The proposed system, BIBERT-Pipe, ranked third on the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard for the multilingual track, showcasing its competitive performance.

Conclusion: The modifications made in the proposed system demonstrate the effectiveness of minimal adjustments for improving multilingual and nested biomedical EL performance, while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on
English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of
nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for
the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task
(English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps
the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components:
Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both
stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the
ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the
ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing
the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to
overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the
ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing
coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our
two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual
track, demonstrating the effectiveness and competitiveness of these minimal yet
principled modifications. Code are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using LLMs to translate machine-verifiable formal proofs into readable natural language proofs using informalization and summarization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the readability and accessibility of formal proofs by translating them into natural language, making them more understandable for non-experts.

Method: The method involves utilizing LLMs for informalization (verbalizing proof steps) and summarizing, and is tested on formal proof data aligned with natural language proofs from textbooks, as well as existing libraries from the Lean proof assistant.

Result: The translated natural language proofs were of high quality, readable, and accurate when compared to their original counterparts.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that LLMs can effectively generate coherent and precise natural language proofs from formal machine-verifiable proofs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a natural language translation method for
machine-verifiable formal proofs that leverages the informalization
(verbalization of formal language proof steps) and summarization capabilities
of LLMs. For evaluation, it was applied to formal proof data created in
accordance with natural language proofs taken from an undergraduate-level
textbook, and the quality of the generated natural language proofs was analyzed
in comparison with the original natural language proofs. Furthermore, we will
demonstrate that this method can output highly readable and accurate natural
language proofs by applying it to existing formal proof library of the Lean
proof assistant.

### [46] [A Role-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Financial Education Question Answering with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09727)
*Andy Zhu,Yingjun Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a multi-agent framework for improving question answering (QA) in finance using role-based prompting and retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with nuanced financial reasoning, which requires multistep reasoning and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The framework combines three agents (Base Generator, Evidence Retriever, Expert Reviewer) with role-based prompting and retrieval-augmented generation from finance textbooks.

Result: The approach enhances accuracy by 6.6-8.3% compared to baselines and achieves competitive performance even with smaller models.

Conclusion: This framework offers a cost-effective method to boost financial QA performance and opens avenues for further multi-agent system research.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) plays a central role in financial education, yet
existing large language model (LLM) approaches often fail to capture the
nuanced and specialized reasoning required for financial problem-solving. The
financial domain demands multistep quantitative reasoning, familiarity with
domain-specific terminology, and comprehension of real-world scenarios. We
present a multi-agent framework that leverages role-based prompting to enhance
performance on domain-specific QA. Our framework comprises a Base Generator, an
Evidence Retriever, and an Expert Reviewer agent that work in a single-pass
iteration to produce a refined answer. We evaluated our framework on a set of
3,532 expert-designed finance education questions from Study.com, an online
learning platform. We leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
contextual evidence from 6 finance textbooks and prompting strategies for a
domain-expert reviewer. Our experiments indicate that critique-based refinement
improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines,
with the highest performance from Gemini-2.0-Flash. Furthermore, our method
enables GPT-4o-mini to achieve performance comparable to the finance-tuned
FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA. Our results show a cost-effective approach to
enhancing financial QA and offer insights for further research in multi-agent
financial LLM systems.

*Elena Rohde,Jonas Klingwort,Christian Borgs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper is a meta-analysis of ML performance in Twitter sentiment analysis, focusing on average accuracy, heterogeneity, and influences of study characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to consolidate understanding of ML's accuracy in sentiment analysis and address inconsistencies in performance reporting.

Method: Using PRISMA guidelines, 195 trials across 20 studies were analyzed with a three-level random effects model and double arcsine transformation.

Result: The average model accuracy was calculated as 0.80, revealing misleading accuracy reports and suggesting normalization and improved performance reporting practices.

Conclusion: Standardized reporting, including confusion matrices, is crucial for reliable ML comparison, and overall accuracy alone is insufficient due to sensitivity to class imbalances and sentiment class counts.

Abstract: This paper presents a meta-analysis evaluating ML performance in sentiment
analysis for Twitter data. The study aims to estimate the average performance,
assess heterogeneity between and within studies, and analyze how study
characteristics influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, we
searched academic databases and selected 195 trials from 20 studies with 12
study features. Overall accuracy, the most reported performance metric, was
analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects
model. The average overall accuracy of the AIC-optimized model was 0.80 [0.76,
0.84]. This paper provides two key insights: 1) Overall accuracy is widely used
but often misleading due to its sensitivity to class imbalance and the number
of sentiment classes, highlighting the need for normalization. 2) Standardized
reporting of model performance, including reporting confusion matrices for
independent test sets, is essential for reliable comparisons of ML classifiers
across studies, which seems far from common practice.

*Gerard Sant,Zifan Jiang,Carlos Escolano,Amit Moryossef,Mathias Müller,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultimodalHugs, a new framework to improve reproducibility and flexibility in sign language processing research, addressing limitations of current tools like Hugging Face.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign Language Processing (SLP) research faces challenges in reproducibility and comparison due to complex coding practices and lack of flexible experimentation tools.

Method: The framework, MultimodalHugs, extends the Hugging Face platform by incorporating diverse data modalities and tasks, focusing primarily on enabling pose estimation data for sign languages.

Result: Quantitative experiments show that MultimodalHugs efficiently integrates diverse modalities such as pose estimation and pixel data into SLP, enhancing usability and applicability.

Conclusion: MultimodalHugs fills the gap in SLP research tools, improving reproducibility and adaptability, with potential for broader applications beyond sign language.

Abstract: In recent years, sign language processing (SLP) has gained importance in the
general field of Natural Language Processing. However, compared to research on
spoken languages, SLP research is hindered by complex ad-hoc code,
inadvertently leading to low reproducibility and unfair comparisons. Existing
tools that are built for fast and reproducible experimentation, such as Hugging
Face, are not flexible enough to seamlessly integrate sign language
experiments. This view is confirmed by a survey we conducted among SLP
researchers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultimodalHugs, a framework built
on top of Hugging Face that enables more diverse data modalities and tasks,
while inheriting the well-known advantages of the Hugging Face ecosystem. Even
though sign languages are our primary focus, MultimodalHugs adds a layer of
abstraction that makes it more widely applicable to other use cases that do not
fit one of the standard templates of Hugging Face. We provide quantitative
experiments to illustrate how MultimodalHugs can accommodate diverse modalities
such as pose estimation data for sign languages, or pixel data for text
characters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ancient documents are complex and under-digitized, posing difficulties for current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). AncientDoc, a benchmark, is introduced with five tasks to bridge this evaluation gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To digitize and understand the historical and cultural richness of ancient Chinese documents, while addressing the lack of evaluation tools tailored for their complexity in VLMs.

Method: AncientDoc includes five tasks (OCR, vernacular translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA), covering various document types and using metrics for assessing VLMs alongside human-aligned scoring.

Result: AncientDoc evaluates mainstream VLMs across diverse tasks and provides a structured method to benchmark their performance in processing complex ancient Chinese texts.

Conclusion: AncientDoc fills a critical gap in assessing VLMs for Chinese ancient documents, offering more comprehensive benchmarking to advance their digitization and understanding.

Abstract: Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese
history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face
challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only
scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their
visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English
printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on
ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first
benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to
knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular
translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and
covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on
AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by
a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

*Zikang Guo,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Wentao Hong,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCP-AgentBench, a benchmark to evaluate language agents' performance in MCP-mediated tool interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MCP's growing adoption, there is a lack of adequate benchmarks that evaluate real-world agent performance in MCP contexts.

Method: The authors created MCP-AgentBench, featuring 33 servers with 188 tools, 600 queries in 6 categories, and a new evaluation methodology (MCP-Eval).

Result: MCP-AgentBench rigorously assesses language agents, providing insights into their performance and potential improvements.

Conclusion: MCP-AgentBench offers the AI research community a standardized framework to improve MCP-aligned agent capabilities and interoperability.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open
standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and
is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely
utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing
benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new
paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and
an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical
evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark
specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in
MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include:
the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers
with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600
systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of
varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel
outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success.
Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide
foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with
a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents
capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating
progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

### [51] [Discrimination by LLMs: Cross-lingual Bias Assessment and Mitigation in Decision-Making and Summarisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09735)
*Willem Huijzer,Jieying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates biases in large language models (LLMs), focusing on demographic variables and cross-lingual effects, while exploring mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns regarding societal inequalities and information biases arising from the use of LLMs, especially in decision-making and summarization tasks.

Method: The study utilized a translated dataset for Dutch, generated prompts for decision and summarization tasks, tested demographic and linguistic variations on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, and evaluated mitigation instruction effectiveness.

Result: Biases were prominent in decision-making tasks, favoring female gender and younger ages, with minimal bias in summarization tasks. Bias patterns were similar across English and Dutch, with reduced biases in GPT-4o through mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: Effective mitigation strategies can reduce biases but require refinement. The research highlights the importance of bias awareness and cautious LLM deployment for responsible AI use.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains
raises concerns about societal inequalities and information bias. This study
examines biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, with a focus on
their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks. Additionally, the
research examines the cross-lingual propagation of these biases and evaluates
the effectiveness of prompt-instructed mitigation strategies. Using an adapted
version of the dataset by Tamkin et al. (2023) translated into Dutch, we
created 151,200 unique prompts for the decision task and 176,400 for the
summarisation task. Various demographic variables, instructions, salience
levels, and languages were tested on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our analysis revealed
that both models were significantly biased during decision-making, favouring
female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds such as the
African-American background. In contrast, the summarisation task showed minimal
evidence of bias, though significant age-related differences emerged for
GPT-3.5 in English. Cross-lingual analysis showed that bias patterns were
broadly similar between English and Dutch, though notable differences were
observed across specific demographic categories. The newly proposed mitigation
instructions, while unable to eliminate biases completely, demonstrated
potential in reducing them. The most effective instruction achieved a 27\% mean
reduction in the gap between the most and least favorable demographics.
Notably, contrary to GPT-3.5, GPT-4o displayed reduced biases for all prompts
in English, indicating the specific potential for prompt-based mitigation
within newer models. This research underscores the importance of cautious
adoption of LLMs and context-specific bias testing, highlighting the need for
continued development of effective mitigation strategies to ensure responsible
deployment of AI.

### [52] [HEFT: A Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchy for Enhancing the Efficiency and Accuracy of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09801)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEFT, a hierarchical fine-tuning approach combining two parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and ReFT), achieving superior performance in reasoning tasks with reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specialized reasoning tasks while minimizing computational resource demands.

Method: The proposed method, HEFT, hierarchically combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for foundational adaptation in weight space with Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for refined internal activations.

Result: Using HEFT on the BoolQ benchmark, the fine-tuned model achieved 85.17% accuracy in only 3 epochs, outperforming LoRA-only (85.05%) and ReFT-only (83.36%) approaches over 20 epochs.

Conclusion: HEFT's synergistic composition of PEFT methods significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency and model reasoning performance, presenting a promising strategy for adapting LLMs to complex tasks.

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks
is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the
landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in
either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper
investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms
can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical
Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes
two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,
foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using
Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a
Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential
reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned
for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%,
exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only
(85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the
thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation,
offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning
capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction
of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to
overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex
cognitive tasks.

### [53] [Pragmatic Frames Evoked by Gestures: A FrameNet Brasil Approach to Multimodality in Turn Organization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09804)
*Helen de Andrade Abreu,Tiago Timponi Torrent,Ely Edison da Silva Matos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework analyzing how gestures, alongside language, coordinate conversational turns. Researchers annotated a dataset from a Brazilian TV show to model these interactions, yielding insights into gesture use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how interactive gestures, in combination with language, influence conversational turn-taking, exploring unstudied aspects of multimodal communication.

Method: The researchers enriched an existing multimodal dataset (Frame2) with annotations for pragmatic frames focusing on gestures used in turn organization, based on television show episodes.

Result: Communicators utilize gestures to regulate conversational turns effectively, and the findings include new undocumented gesture variations.

Conclusion: The annotated dataset provides valuable insights into human cognition and communicative strategies, validating gestures as key tools in conversational exchange linked to pragmatic frames.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn
organization via the proposition of correlations between language and
interactive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are
conceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for
the analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal
dataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling
conversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has
been studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,
especially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a
dataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched
the Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The
Frame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo
Mundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset
allowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures
outside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in
related literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in
face-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking
and keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures
that had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures
arises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces,
blending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the
annotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human
cognition and language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach to improve multi-document summarization (MDS), with experiments showing enhanced performance compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively integrating information from multiple documents while preserving coherence and relevance in MDS, where existing large language models underperform.

Method: The paper proposes a topic-guided reinforcement learning method utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel topic reward to align generated summaries with source document topics.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines in experiments conducted on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging topical cues can significantly enhance multi-document summarization performance, as demonstrated by the new reinforcement learning framework.

Abstract: A key challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is effectively
integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and
topical relevance. While Large Language Models have shown impressive results in
single-document summarization, their performance on MDS still leaves room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning
approach to improve content selection in MDS. We first show that explicitly
prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of the
generated summaries. Building on this insight, we propose a novel topic reward
within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic
alignment between the generated summary and source documents. Experimental
results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of leveraging topical cues in MDS.

*Bastián González-Bustamante,Nando Verelst,Carla Cisternas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating synthetic survey responses, comparing them to human responses from a Chilean survey. Findings indicate high performance on trust-related items but variability across different sociodemographic dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can emulate human responses in survey research, reducing errors and biases, while analyzing their reliability and potential biases in synthetic responses.

Method: The study compared synthetic responses from various LLMs (e.g., GPT, Llama) to human responses in a Chilean public opinion survey. A meta-analysis of 128 question-subsample pairs was conducted using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on biases across sociodemographic dimensions.

Result: The analysis found strong performance for trust-related items (accuracy and F1 > 0.90) and observed that models like GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 4 Maverick performed similarly. Alignment was highest among respondents aged 45-59, but significant item-level heterogeneity was noted.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in approximating human survey responses but struggle with item-level nuances, requiring additional calibration and testing for better alignment and reduction of algorithmic errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and
applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to
emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and
representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item
distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing
social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the
reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth
human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.
Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating
189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128
question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic
dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning
models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First,
synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and
accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform
comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among
respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate
responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level
heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging
and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure
algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and corpora for supervised tasks like headline generation in Chinese minority languages due to their unique writing systems.

Method: The authors curated a novel dataset, CMHG, comprising 100,000 Tibetan entries and 50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian. Additionally, they created a high-quality, native-speaker-annotated test set for benchmarking.

Result: The CMHG dataset and test set provide a solid foundation for headline generation tasks in Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian, enabling more robust research in these areas.

Conclusion: This work contributes valuable resources and benchmarks for advancing headline generation and linguistic research in Chinese minority languages.

Abstract: Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional
Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems,
which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe
lack of relevant corpora, particularly for supervised tasks like headline
generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, Chinese Minority
Headline Generation (CMHG), which includes 100,000 entries for Tibetan, and
50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian, specifically curated for headline
generation tasks. Additionally, we propose a high-quality test set annotated by
native speakers, designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in this
domain. We hope this dataset will become a valuable resource for advancing
headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to the
development of related benchmarks.

*Ponhvoan Srey,Xiaobao Wu,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is an innovative method for detecting hallucinated content from LLMs in an unsupervised manner using internal embeddings and uncertainty-based pseudolabels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised approaches for hallucination detection often rely on signals unrelated to factual correctness, leading to biases and reduced effectiveness across different contexts.

Method: IRIS uses LLM's contextualized embeddings for training and employs uncertainty-based pseudolabels to evaluate statement truthfulness without human annotations.

Result: Experimental evidence shows that IRIS surpasses other unsupervised techniques in performance, maintaining efficiency even with limited data.

Conclusion: IRIS is an effective, computationally efficient, and scalable approach for real-time unsupervised hallucination detection, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content
generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data.
While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating
labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals
unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes
toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability
across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS,
an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal
representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to
carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its
contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the
uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness.
Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing
unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low
cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for
real-time detection.

Method: Few-shot learning was utilized with 20 example prompts using three pre-trained LLMs (LLama2-7B-hf, Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B) and was compared against supervised learning using BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. Metrics such as F1 scores, Jaccard Similarity, and Hamming Loss, among others, were used for evaluation.

Result: Mistral-7B-v0.1 performed best among LLMs on 11 out of 14 intent classes in a few-shot setup, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.50. However, the BERT-based supervised approach outperformed even the best LLM in this study.

Conclusion: The results showcase the potential and limitations of small open-source LLMs for multi-intent dialogue systems, emphasizing the advantage of supervised learning for higher performance but highlighting the feasibility of LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of multi-label intent
classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) that are open-source,
publicly available, and can be run in consumer hardware. We use the MultiWOZ
2.1 dataset, a benchmark in the dialogue system domain, to investigate the
efficacy of three popular open-source pre-trained LLMs, namely LLama2-7B-hf,
Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B. We perform the classification task in a few-shot
setup, giving 20 examples in the prompt with some instructions. Our approach
focuses on the differences in performance of these models across several
performance metrics by methodically assessing these models on multi-label
intent classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of the
instruction-based fine-tuning approach with supervised learning using the
smaller transformer model BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. To
evaluate the performance of the models, we use evaluation metrics like
accuracy, precision, and recall as well as micro, macro, and weighted F1 score.
We also report the inference time, VRAM requirements, etc. The Mistral-7B-v0.1
outperforms two other generative models on 11 intent classes out of 14 in terms
of F-Score, with a weighted average of 0.50. It also has relatively lower
Humming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the
few-shot setting. We find BERT based supervised classifier having superior
performance compared to the best performing few-shot generative LLM. The study
provides a framework for small open-source LLMs in detecting complex
multi-intent dialogues, enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of
task-oriented chatbots.

### [60] [Linguistic trajectories of bipolar disorder on social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10035)
*Laurin Plank,Armin Zlomuzica*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the analysis of social media language to study bipolar disorder (BD) over an extended period, revealing language changes around diagnosis and recurring mood-related shifts afterward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalable methods for tracking affective disorders, such as BD, using social media language due to the limitations of traditional clinical assessments.

Method: The study uses a novel method to determine diagnosis timing and analyze language in social media posts spanning from three years prior to BD diagnosis to up to 21 years post-diagnosis, comparing with users with unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected individuals (HC).

Result: The research shows linguistic changes around BD diagnosis related to mood disturbance and other factors, along with recurring seasonal mood-related language shifts for up to two decades. A trend indicates stronger periodicity in individuals estimated to be female.

Conclusion: The findings validate the use of social media language for understanding BD over acute and chronic phases and underline its potential for scalable mental health monitoring.

Abstract: Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar
disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response,
analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high
temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to
determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language
trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted
with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We
show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations
reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse,
hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and
disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language
changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month
periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence
suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our
findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic
phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for
scalable monitoring of mental health.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper details MSAs winning approach to the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on Arabic readability, using a hybrid ensemble of transformer models to achieve top results in all tracks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle fine-grained Arabic readability assessment amidst challenges like class imbalance and scarce data, and to introduce superior methodologies for reliable prediction.

Method: A confidence-weighted ensemble of AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT, fine-tuned with diverse loss functions, combined with advanced techniques like synthetic data generation, SAMER corpus relabeling, and targeted post-processing.

Result: Achieved top performance in all six tracks with Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 87.5% at the sentence level and 87.4% at the document level.

Conclusion: Model diversity, confidence-informed fusion, and innovative data augmentation strategies are effective for robust Arabic readability prediction, as demonstrated by the team's superior performance.

Abstract: We present MSAs winning system for the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on fine-grained
Arabic readability assessment, achieving first place in six of six tracks. Our
approach is a confidence-weighted ensemble of four complementary transformer
models (AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT) each fine-tuned with
distinct loss functions to capture diverse readability signals. To tackle
severe class imbalance and data scarcity, we applied weighted training,
advanced preprocessing, SAMER corpus relabeling with our strongest model, and
synthetic data generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash, adding about 10,000 rare-level
samples. A targeted post-processing step corrected prediction distribution
skew, delivering a 6.3 percent Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) gain. Our system
reached 87.5 percent QWK at the sentence level and 87.4 percent at the document
level, demonstrating the power of model and loss diversity, confidence-informed
fusion, and intelligent augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

### [62] [Established Psychometric vs. Ecologically Valid Questionnaires: Rethinking Psychological Assessments in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10078)
*Dongmin Choi,Woojung Song,Jongwook Han,Eun-Ju Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comparison of established psychometric questionnaires versus ecologically valid ones reveals substantial differences in evaluating the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study highlights limitations of traditional questionnaires and advises caution in their use for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a concern about the ecological validity of using human-designed psychometric questionnaires, such as the BFI and PVQ, to evaluate LLMs' personality traits and values, especially as these surveys may not reflect real-world contexts encountered by LLMs.

Method: The authors performed a comparative analysis between traditional questionnaires and ecologically valid questionnaires to determine differences in their evaluation outcomes for LLMs' psychological characteristics.

Result: The analysis found that traditional questionnaires yield different profiles from ecologically valid ones, lack stability in measurement, create false impressions of stable constructs in LLMs, and exaggerate traits in persona-prompted models.

Conclusion: The paper advises against using established psychological questionnaires to evaluate LLMs due to their significant ecological validity issues and plans to release the research code publicly.

Abstract: Researchers have applied established psychometric questionnaires (e.g., BFI,
PVQ) to measure the personality traits and values reflected in the responses of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, concerns have been raised about applying
these human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of
ecological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect
and resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to
user queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and
ecologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights
these differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
comparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals
that established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of
LLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological
characteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from
insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions
that LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for
persona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of
established psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released
upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A domain-specific Knowledge Graph was introduced to improve climate science information retrieval, enabling semantic and structured querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the problem posed by the growing complexity and volume of climate science literature, which makes it hard for researchers to easily access relevant information.

Method: The authors created a domain-specific Knowledge Graph from climate publications and scientific texts. They employ Cypher queries for semantic searches and integrate with large language models in RAG systems.

Result: The Knowledge Graph demonstrated its ability to answer structured queries about climate models, datasets, regions, and teleconnection patterns, illustrating its practical value.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of a domain-specific KG and its integration with advanced AI systems for enhancing access to accurate and contextual climate scientific knowledge.

Abstract: The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it
increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across
models, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a
domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and
broader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed
and used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic
queries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models
have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used
with certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such
questions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language
models in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in
climate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to
show its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others
who rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.

*Abdulrahman Allam,Seif Ahmed,Ali Hamdi,Ammar Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical text generation to improve hospital management systems, demonstrating the potential of AI in addressing healthcare challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in hospital management systems (HMS), such as overcrowding and lack of resources, by providing accurate, real-time medical advice, especially for underrepresented languages like Arabic.

Method: The authors collected a unique dataset of Arabic medical conversations, cleaned and processed the data for various dialects, and fine-tuned generative models like Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium to generate reliable medical responses.

Result: The fine-tuned Mistral-7B model achieved the best performance, with average BERT Score values of 68.5% for precision, 69.08% for recall, and 68.5% for F1-scores, validated through comparative benchmarking and qualitative assessments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of generative AI in supporting HMS and highlights its scalability for addressing global healthcare challenges, especially in linguistically diverse environments.

Abstract: Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address
challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of
urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide
accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and
underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes
an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical
text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing
accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans
based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a
unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical
conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient
complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed
to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art
generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2
Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.
Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model
outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and
F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative
benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to
produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study
highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare
challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

*Abdulrahman Allam,Seif Ahmed,Ali Hamdi,Khaled Shaban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic data augmentation approach to expand Arabic medical chatbot training data from 20,000 to 100,000 records. It uses AI systems to generate new data, fine-tunes language models, and shows improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality Arabic annotated datasets, which limits the development of scalable and generalizable Arabic medical chatbots.

Method: The study employs a generative AI-based approach using ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro to create 80,000 synthetic contextually relevant question-answer pairs. The data is semantically filtered, manually validated, and incorporated into the training pipeline. They fine-tuned five language models, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2, and performed evaluations using BERTScore metrics and qualitative assessments.

Result: The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o-generated data outperformed Gemini in terms of F1-scores and reduced hallucinations. The synthetic data augmentation strategy proved effective in enhancing model scalability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation is a viable solution for improving domain-specific models in low-resource medical NLP, enabling the development of more inclusive and precise Arabic healthcare chatbots.

Abstract: The development of medical chatbots in Arabic is significantly constrained by
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. While prior
efforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from
social media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and
generalization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic
data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records.
Using advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated
80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer
pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic
samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the
training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2,
and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven
qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic
sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and
Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data
consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all
models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic
augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language
models in-low resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive,
scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating prominence detection into ASR for conversational Austrian German, achieving 85.53% prominence detection accuracy with no transcription performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR systems with prominence detection to improve prosodic and dialogue understanding.

Method: Fine-tuned wav2vec2 models for prominence detection and trained ASR systems to include word-level prominence annotations.

Result: 85.53% prominence detection accuracy in correctly transcribed utterances with no transcription performance degradation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates transformer models' effectiveness in encoding prosodic information and offers potential for linguistic and dialogue applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates prominence-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR)
by combining prominence detection and speech recognition for conversational
Austrian German. First, prominence detectors were developed by fine-tuning
wav2vec2 models to classify word-level prominence. The detector was then used
to automatically annotate prosodic prominence in a large corpus. Based on those
annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously
transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence
information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system,
while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where
the recognized word sequence was correct. This paper shows that
transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and
represents a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR, with potential
applications for linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to create realistic, globally aligned personas for LLM-driven social simulations by leveraging social media data and psychometric distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven social simulations often neglect the construction of diverse, representative persona sets, introducing biases that can undermine authenticity and reliability.

Method: The authors propose generating narrative personas from social media data, assessing their quality rigorously, and applying importance sampling to align with reference psychometric distributions. A task-specific module tailors personas to subpopulations for specific contexts.

Result: Experiments show that the framework reduces population-level bias and enhances simulation accuracy and flexibility across varied applications.

Conclusion: This systematic approach provides a scalable solution for creating high-quality, representative persona sets, advancing computational social science research and policy development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like
social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new
opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is
the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and
distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social
simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and
simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona
generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona
sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing
high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.
Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from
long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter
out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global
alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five
personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we
further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned
persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,
flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocExplainerV0, a module that improves spatial localization of answers in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which was previously a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the interpretability and real-world applicability of VLMs by addressing their limitations in localizing answers within complex documents.

Method: The authors propose DocExplainerV0, a bounding-box prediction module that separates answer generation from spatial localization, compatible with existing VLMs without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Systematic evaluation shows that while VLMs often achieve textual accuracy, their spatial grounding is insufficient. DocExplainerV0 addresses this gap and provides standardized evaluation insights.

Conclusion: DocExplainerV0 improves spatial localization, establishing benchmarks and paving the path for more robust and interpretable document understanding in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document
understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information
from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within
documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and
real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce
\textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that
decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it
applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is
not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights
into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that
correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework
highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research
toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores register differences between human-written texts and those created by large language models (LLMs), using multidimensional analysis to identify systematic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models (LLMs) differ from humans in text creation, specifically in register variation, and provide benchmarks for comparison.

Method: Applied multidimensional analysis to human-written and AI-generated texts in English and Czech, leveraging newly created corpora and analyzing 16 LLMs in various configurations.

Result: Identified systematic differences in register between human and LLM texts, established benchmarks, and provided a ranking framework for comparing LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit distinct patterns in textual register compared to human authors, with differences influenced by training and instruction-tuning settings. Benchmarks offer key insights for model evaluation.

Abstract: This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and
comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's
multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts
and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions
of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically
from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used,
which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary
British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in
the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech
using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16
frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the
difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a
benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and
ranked in interpretable dimensions.

*Leen Almajed,Abeer ALdayel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how both human and large language model (LLM)-generated responses can demonstrate incongruent positivity, especially in high-stakes emotional support conversations, and presents methods to improve emotional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the issue of well-intended positivity misfiring, often leading to responses that dismiss or minimize emotions, particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts.

Method: The study collects dialogues from Reddit, categorizes them into Mild and Severe emotional intensities, analyzes LLM-generated responses, finetunes LLMs, and develops a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble to detect incongruent positivity.

Result: LLMs are found to be more prone to unrealistic positivity, particularly in severe emotional contexts. The classifier ensemble improves the detection of mismatched positivity types across Mild and Severe concerns.

Conclusion: This research highlights the need for context-sensitive systems that balance positivity with emotional acknowledgment in online supportive dialogues, promoting trust and alignment with users' emotional needs.

Abstract: In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can
sometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or
unrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent
positivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and
LLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant
dialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated
additional responses using large language models for the same context. We
categorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers
relationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and
anxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative
analysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes
contexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic
positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes
contexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we
finetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,
we developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and
MentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types
across two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the
need to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead
study the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional
acknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language
models with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving
the way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.

*Miklós Sebők,Viktor Kovács,Martin Bánóczy,Daniel Møller Eriksen,Nathalie Neptune,Philippe Roussille*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates BERT and its variants, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, for long text classification, focusing on legal documents. Despite Longformer's long input capacity, no notable advantage was found over other models, with GPT variants performing comparably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of handling long input texts in language models, particularly crucial for tasks like classifying lengthy legal documents.

Method: Experiments were conducted using XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on a 21-class classification task across 5 languages, based on the Comparative Agendas Project's codebook.

Result: No significant advantage was found for Longformer. The best-performing open model outperformed GPT variants slightly. Class-level analysis highlighted the impact of overlap between categories on classification performance.

Conclusion: Longformer's capability to handle longer texts does not necessarily translate to better classification outcomes. Open models perform competitively, and factors such as inter-class substance overlaps are important.

Abstract: The most widely used large language models in the social sciences (such as
BERT, and its derivatives, e.g. RoBERTa) have a limitation on the input text
length that they can process to produce predictions. This is a particularly
pressing issue for some classification tasks, where the aim is to handle long
input texts. One such area deals with laws and draft laws (bills), which can
have a length of multiple hundred pages and, therefore, are not particularly
amenable for processing with models that can only handle e.g. 512 tokens. In
this paper, we show results from experiments covering 5 languages with
XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models for the multiclass
classification task of the Comparative Agendas Project, which has a codebook of
21 policy topic labels from education to health care. Results show no
particular advantage for the Longformer model, pre-trained specifically for the
purposes of handling long inputs. The comparison between the GPT variants and
the best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of
class-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps
between specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.

*Shengqiang Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to improve the contextual faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a self-improving framework called SI FACT, which reduces reliance on internal memory and enhances response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often struggle with generating accurate responses in knowledge-intensive tasks due to their reliance on internal knowledge over context.

Method: A self-improving framework called Self Improving Faithfulness Aware Contrastive Tuning (SI FACT) is proposed. It employs a self-instruct mechanism to generate data for contrastive learning, aiming to teach the model to differentiate between faithful and unfaithful responses.

Result: The SI FACT model achieves a Contextual Recall Rate improvement of 6.2% over leading baseline methods and demonstrates reduced dependency on internal memory.

Conclusion: SI FACT effectively improves the contextual faithfulness of LLMs through automated data generation and contrastive learning, paving the way for more trustworthy LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge
intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying on
internal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address this
issue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving Faithfulness
Aware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism that
allows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structured
contrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalent
positive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.This
approach significantly reduces the cost of manual
annotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train the
model,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful
responses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledge
conflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACT
model based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2%
over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence on
internal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectiveness
and high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness of
LLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive and
trustworthy language models.

*Yixiao Zhou,Ziyu Zhao,Dongzhou Cheng,zhiliang wu,Jie Gui,Yi Yang,Fei Wu,Yu Cheng,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DERN, a method to optimize Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures by pruning redundant experts and reorganizing their neuron-level structure. This approach enhances efficiency and performance without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory usage and deployment challenges in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures, despite their computational efficiency.

Method: The proposed DERN framework prunes redundant experts, decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, reallocates segments to retained experts, and merges them to create streamlined representations.

Result: Experiments show that DERN achieves over 5% performance improvement on benchmarks such as commonsense reasoning and MMLU under 50% expert sparsity, while significantly reducing memory usage and the number of experts.

Conclusion: DERN provides an effective solution for optimizing SMoE models by reducing redundancy and memory usage, improving performance, and easing practical deployment without retraining.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large
language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though
only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading
all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in
deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and
merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving
neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,
Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert
pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and
contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for
direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes
redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into
neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible
retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to
build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE
models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense
reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra
training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,
making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

### [74] [Is In-Context Learning Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414)
*Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates In-context learning (ICL), noting its effectiveness but highlighting its limitations in learning and generalizing to unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether In-context learning (ICL) constitutes true learning or if it relies primarily on prior knowledge and exemplars.

Method: A large-scale analysis examining ICL by isolating factors like memorization, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style.

Result: ICL can learn but struggles to generalize to new tasks; accuracy depends on exemplar availability and prompt regularities.

Conclusion: ICL's ability is limited by its ad-hoc encoding mechanism, suggesting restricted generalization to unseen tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks
via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to
claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a
few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply
learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the
models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue
that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full
characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale
analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,
distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an
effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise
to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more
numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt
style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from
regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,
especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied
accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc
encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose
generalisability.

*Christopher Ormerod,Gitit Kehat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of maximum input length limitations in transformer-based language models for Automated Essay Scoring (AES) using several models with architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the validity concerns caused by text truncation due to fixed length constraints in existing AES models.

Method: Various modified transformer-based models, such as XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama, were evaluated using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset.

Result: The study performed comparative evaluations to understand how these models handle long-context inputs without truncation.

Conclusion: Architectural adjustments to transformer-based models effectively mitigate the length constraints, improving their ability to assess essays accurately in AES tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process
text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students
frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source
models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for
Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious
validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and
evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long
contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate
architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to
overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models
considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer,
ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A cloud-edge collaborative architecture using three specialized LLM agents (GuideLLM, SolverLLM, JudgeLLM) achieves high accuracy in coding tasks benchmarked by RefactorCoderQA, surpassing existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of existing benchmarks in reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs across multi-domain coding tasks.

Method: Introduce a cloud-edge collaborative architecture with three specialized agents (GuideLLM, SolverLLM, JudgeLLM), supported by a new benchmark called RefactorCoderQA.

Result: RefactorCoder-MoE, the fine-tuned model, demonstrated state-of-the-art performance with 76.84% accuracy, outperforming open-source and commercial alternatives.

Conclusion: The cloud-edge framework and multi-domain coding benchmark improve LLM capabilities in real-world coding scenarios, while providing interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that
enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises
three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the
edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model
hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an
automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate
and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings,
we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain
coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks,
RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including
Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language
Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive
experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source
and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations
further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the
generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as
throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepDive improves large language models (LLMs) for demanding search tasks using automatic question generation and multi-turn reinforcement learning, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open LLMs struggle with long-horizon reasoning in complex search tasks due to limited supervised data and practical challenges.

Method: DeepDive synthesizes complex questions from open knowledge graphs and applies multi-turn reinforcement learning to enhance LLM reasoning during browsing.

Result: DeepDive-32B outperforms existing tools like WebSailor and DeepSeek in BrowseComp benchmarks and improves search abilities across other benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeepDive advances deep search agents with better reasoning and scalability, providing valuable resources for open research.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially
improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world
tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited
long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of
sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present
DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to
automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from
open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search.
Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive
result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and
Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search
ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across
multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool
calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly

*Akshat Pandey,Karun Kumar,Raphael Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes "WhisTLE," a text-only adaptation method for pretrained automatic speech recognition, reducing word error rates significantly compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation for pretrained ASR models is necessary to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance, especially in situations where collecting speech data is impractical.

Method: WhisTLE employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text, fine-tunes the decoder using a text-to-latent encoder, and optionally integrates text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. During inference, the original encoder is restored without additional runtime costs.

Result: WhisTLE demonstrates a 12.3% relative reduction in word error rate compared to TTS-only adaptation and achieves superior performance across multiple datasets and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed WhisTLE method effectively adapts pretrained ASR models for out-of-domain tasks using text-only data, offering a practical solution without requiring extra computational costs during inference.

Abstract: Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform
well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance.
In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical,
necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised,
text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE
trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and
fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally
combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original
encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain
datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by
12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines
in 27 of 32 scenarios.

*Jiayi Miao,Dingxin Lu,Zhuqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG), a framework that integrates image and text data to evaluate housing damage after natural disasters with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate evaluation of housing damage post-disasters is critical for effective insurance claims and efficient resource planning.

Method: The MM-RAG framework extends classical RAG architecture with a two-branch multimodal encoder. It integrates a ResNet-Transformer-based visual encoder for images, a BERT-based text retriever for textual data, and uses cross-modal interaction and modal attention gating mechanisms to align and fuse information. The framework employs multi-task optimization for improved image-text synergy.

Result: The proposed approach significantly enhances retrieval accuracy and damage classification, achieving a Top-1 retrieval accuracy improvement of 9.6%.

Conclusion: The MM-RAG framework successfully demonstrates its ability to integrate visual and textual data for superior post-disaster damage evaluation, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in insurance and disaster planning.

Abstract: After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are
important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this
work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG)
framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to
devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs
a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the
characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses
a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance
policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose
cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction
module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via
multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal
attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and
text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end
training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the
generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image
understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results
demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index
on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by
9.6%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ensemble framework to enhance text extraction accuracy from noisy historical documents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) by using multiple augmented image transcriptions and a custom alignment process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of extracting accurate text from noisy historical documents, where traditional single-shot transcription methods fail to achieve high accuracy.

Method: The method involves generating multiple augmented image variants for transcription using Gemini 2.0 Flash and combining the outputs through a customized Needleman Wunsch style aligner that provides consensus transcriptions and confidence scores.

Result: Using a new dataset of 622 Pennsylvania death records, their approach demonstrated an improvement in transcription accuracy by 4 percentage points compared to a single-shot baseline. Padding and blurring augmented accuracy, while grid warp separated high-confidence from low-confidence results.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, scalable, and can be deployed easily for other historical document collections and transcription models effectively improving their transcription capabilities.

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text
extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented
variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a
custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus
transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622
Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription
accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find
that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while
grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases.
The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document
collections and transcription models.

TL;DR: The authors present MITS, a large-scale multimodal dataset for Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS), designed to improve the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in ITS-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General large multimodal models perform poorly in the ITS domain due to a lack of dedicated multimodal datasets.

Method: The authors created the MITS dataset, comprising 170,400 real-world ITS images with diverse annotations and an additional 5 million ITS-specific visual QA pairs. They fine-tuned mainstream LMMs on this dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned LMMs showed significant performance improvements, e.g., LLaVA-1.5's accuracy increased by 83.2%, and other models also achieved notable gains in ITS tasks.

Conclusion: MITS fills a critical gap, enhances LMM performance in ITS applications, and supports ITS and LMM research by releasing resources as open-source.

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of decision trees for improving fine-grained visual classification performance in Vision Language Models (VLMs), finding that tree-based reasoning underperforms compared to standard zero-shot prompting, though enhancements in prompts can boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether structured reasoning approaches like decision trees can improve the interpretability and performance of VLMs, particularly on fine-grained and hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Introduced a framework utilizing decision trees to decompose visual classification into interpretable steps, evaluating its effectiveness on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Performance was compared to standard zero-shot prompting, and tree prompts were enhanced with LLM-generated classes and image descriptions to improve alignment.

Result: Tree-based reasoning achieved 98.2% accuracy in tree knowledge understanding but underperformed compared to zero-shot prompting on both datasets. Adding image descriptions improved the performance of both tree-based and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning like decision trees provides interpretability but is less effective in performance for visual classification tasks compared to standard methods. Improvements in prompts offer avenues for enhancing both interpretability and accuracy in VLM systems.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but
their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is
understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning
can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes
classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates
it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the
model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based
reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also
explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image
descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the
performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight
limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights
for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSI, a system for creating world models from data through a cycle of probabilistic prediction, structure extraction, and integration, enabling enhanced control, analysis, and predictive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that learns flexible, controllable, and richly descriptive world models from large-scale data, enabling tasks like video prediction, understanding, and the extraction of intermediate structures.

Method: PSI utilizes a three-step cycle: probabilistic prediction (creating a graphical model), structure extraction (deriving interpretable intermediate structures), and integration (back-feeding these structures for ongoing model improvement).

Result: The PSI system was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data and achieved applications such as state-of-the-art optical flow, depth, and object segmentation, as well as improved predictive accuracy for video understanding.

Conclusion: PSI successfully demonstrates the ability to build advanced and controllable predictive models, enhancing tasks like video understanding and facilitating further innovations via an iterative learning process.

Abstract: We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning
richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI
consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction,
involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form
of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set
of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables
in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we
show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,
corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a
zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes
the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then
continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and
prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both
allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control
handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an
instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to
perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we
extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object
segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive
improvements.

*Md Fazle Rasul,Alanood Alqobaisi,Bruhadeshwar Bezawada,Indrakshi Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores gradient inversion attacks on video data in federated learning, revealing that feature extractors offer resilience but video leakage is still possible under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the overlooked vulnerability of federated learning in the video domain due to gradient inversion attacks, given the importance of privacy.

Method: Analyze video data leakage caused by gradient inversion attacks on federated learning using two video classification methods and super-resolution techniques.

Result: Feature extractors resist attacks better but attackers can still reconstruct high-quality videos depending on classifier complexity and reference frames.

Conclusion: Video data leakage is a real threat in federated learning, requiring further study to understand the circumstances and defenses against it.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model
collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants
only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive
data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy
and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism
is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private
training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.
While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,
their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper
presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient
inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one
employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video
frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use
of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion
attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance
the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to
reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across
scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames
from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make
attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks
sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is
a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further
investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited labeled data and complex conditions in densely packed retail environments.

Method: Combines Faster R-CNN with YOLO for object detection, uses ensemble classification with XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM, and optimizes hyperparameters using metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Achieves strong performance on the SKU-110k dataset, demonstrating scalability and real-world application suitability.

Conclusion: The framework reduces annotation costs and adapts to retail changes, making it viable for automated systems like inventory tracking and product monitoring.

Abstract: This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object
detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and
complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN
(utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a
Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange
that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To
strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest,
and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness.
Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing
precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual
labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to
frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the
SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability
and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications
such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel, efficient method called Token Purging (PG) for test-time adaptation in 3D point cloud classification under domain shifts, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for robust test-time adaptation methods to counteract performance issues caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification.

Method: The authors introduce Token Purging (PG), which eliminates domain-shift-affected tokens before attention layers in a backpropagation-free manner. They propose two variants: PG-SP, which uses source statistics, and PG-SF, a source-free version based on CLS-token-driven adaptation.

Result: PG-SP improves accuracy by an average of +10.3% over state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods, while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Additionally, PG is significantly faster (12.4x) and more memory-efficient (5.5x) than their baseline.

Conclusion: Token Purging (PG) is an efficient and effective test-time adaptation strategy, suitable for real-world deployment due to its significant improvements in accuracy, speed, and memory usage.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation
caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,
we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that
removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention
layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring
robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,
which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version
relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,
ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of

### [88] [Fine-Grained Cross-View Localization via Local Feature Matching and Monocular Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09792)
*Zimin Xia,Chenghao Xu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to estimate the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of ground-level images using local feature matching with aerial images. This is achieved without fully transforming the ground image into a bird’s-eye view, addressing common issues like perspective distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization methods often distort key spatial information when transforming ground images into bird's-eye view representations, leading to degraded alignments. A more accurate and interpretable localization approach is needed.

Method: The method directly matches local features of ground images with aerial images, lifting only matched keypoints to a bird's-eye view using monocular depth priors. A scale-aware Procrustes alignment is used to estimate camera pose.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior localization performance under challenging scenarios, such as cross-area generalization and unknown orientations. The method is compatible with various depth models without requiring finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively learns accurate feature correspondences with weak supervision and achieves robust localization performance, making it suitable for real-world scenarios while providing flexibility across diverse depth models.

Abstract: We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view
localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a
ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial
image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye
view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for
localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due
to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby
degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method
directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts
only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,
modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples
are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they
still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown
scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a
scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the
correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera
pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves
superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as
cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is
compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model
finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance,
makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using a mobile app called KidsVisionCheck, researchers emulate the Bruckner test to detect visual impairments in children with 90% accuracy using deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an accessible, mobile-based solution for pediatric vision screenings to allow early detection of visual impairments, especially in non-clinical settings.

Method: The study trained deep neural networks on pupil images of children, labeled by ophthalmologists, to perform vision screening using red-eye reflex images on a mobile device.

Result: The model achieved a high accuracy rate of 90% on unseen test data and offered feedback on optimal data collection conditions.

Conclusion: KidsVisionCheck represents a significant step forward in accessible, mobile-based vision screening for children worldwide, enabling early intervention and improving global pediatric eye care.

Abstract: Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from
young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by
ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological
advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to
recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a
first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free
application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using
red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks
trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.
With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable
performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can
identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used
to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first
step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for
vision abnormalities worldwide.

*Tim Broedermannn,Christos Sakaridis,Luigi Piccinelli,Wim Abbeloos,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGFusion, a depth-guided multimodal fusion model that enhances semantic perception for autonomous vehicles by dynamically adapting sensor fusion based on depth-related spatial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art sensor fusion methods struggle with uniformly treating multimodal sensor data across varying conditions, especially in challenging environments.

Method: A novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method is developed, leveraging lidar's depth measurements both as input and ground truth. Depth-aware features are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens and combined with global condition tokens to enable adaptive sensor fusion.

Result: DGFusion achieves state-of-the-art semantic and panoptic segmentation performance on the MUSES and DELIVER datasets, demonstrating robustness against challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Depth information can significantly improve condition-aware fusion in multimodal networks by dynamically adapting to the spatial reliability of sensors, enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

*Chengyu Yang,Rishik Reddy Yesgari,Chengjun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes new patch-based methods using ResNet-18 deep learning for automatic rosacea detection, emphasizing localized visual information, better performance, and patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop accurate, robust, and privacy-preserving methods for early rosacea detection, which improves treatment effectiveness.

Method: The paper uses patch-based strategies with ResNet-18, extracting image patches of various sizes and shapes, and evaluates their influence on detection performance.

Result: The patch-based methods achieve better accuracy and sensitivity than full-image methods, guide the model to focus on relevant areas, and ensure patient privacy.

Conclusion: The strategies enhance detection accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, while protecting patient privacy, offering practical insights for automated dermatological diagnostics.

Abstract: Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with
facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and
early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper
presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the
ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies
come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted
from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.
Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the
localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.
Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based
automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy
and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed
patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve
patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies
guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance
robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the
proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated
dermatological diagnostics.

*Chengyu Yang,Rishik Reddy Yesgari,Chengjun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated rosacea detection method using synthetic data and facial erythema-based input masking to provide privacy-preserving and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rosacea is challenging to detect due to its diffuse symptoms, limited labeled datasets, and the privacy concerns tied to real facial images.

Method: The method involves constructing a redness-informed mask focusing on diagnostic areas of the central face and training a ResNet-18 model on masked synthetic images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms full-face baselines, showing better accuracy, recall, and F1 score on real-world test datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data and clinical priors can drive accurate and ethical AI systems for privacy-sensitive dermatological applications, such as telemedicine and screening.

Abstract: Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of
accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data.
The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical
priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems,
especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale
screening.

Motivation: To assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components of the ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking.

Method: Ablation study by systematically removing or modifying components (e.g., learnable Wiener filter, specific loss terms) and benchmarking on performance metrics and visual comparisons.

Result: The contributions of each component were evaluated by benchmarking the framework variants on a paired laparoscopic image dataset using metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, MSE, and CIEDE-2000, along with visual comparisons.

Conclusion: The study identifies how each component of the ULW framework impacts its overall performance, providing insights into the necessity of these elements.

Abstract: To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components
within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking,
this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a
U-Net based backbone with a compound loss function that comprises mean squared
error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and perceptual loss. The
framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module.
In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its
specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The
analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective
use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are
benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using
quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative
visual comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-modal drone detection system called WAVE-DETR that combines visual (RGB) and acoustic data using Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 models. It improves drone detection performance, especially for small drones, under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real-life UAV detection by leveraging both visual and acoustic data for improved robustness under challenging environmental conditions.

Method: Developing a unified object detection model based on Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, coupled with four fusion mechanisms (gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP, and cross attention) for feature fusion of RGB and acoustic data.

Result: The proposed gated fusion configuration achieves significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) for drone detection, ranging from 11.1% to 15.3% for small drones and 3.27% to 5.84% for medium and large drones.

Conclusion: The fusion of visual and acoustic features positively impacts drone detection performance, with a gated fusion approach demonstrating the best results. This multi-modal system is effective across drone sizes and environmental conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and
acoustic signals for robust real-life UAV object detection. Our approach fuses
visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the
Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under
challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing
Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more
than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic
information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object
detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four
different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP
and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi
resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object
detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the
gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object
detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by
11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9.
The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall
gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of surrogate supervision to improve image registration networks' robustness and generalizability across diverse input scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based image registration networks are highly accurate but sensitive to variations in input characteristics, leading to a need for improved robustness and generalization.

Method: The authors propose surrogate supervision, decoupling input domains from supervision domains by applying spatial transformations to surrogate images, which enables training on heterogeneous inputs.

Result: Surrogate supervision displayed strong resilience to input variations like field mismatches, artifacts, and modality differences while maintaining performance on well-curated data.

Conclusion: Surrogate supervision offers a principled approach for building robust, generalizable training paradigms, simplifying complexity in medical image registration networks.

Abstract: Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved
strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image
characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality
difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the
robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce
surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision
domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This
allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed
in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through
three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration,
mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results:
Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input
variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and
modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data.
Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training
robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without
increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical
pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling
broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

*Barkin Buyukcakir,Jannick De Tobel,Patrick Thevissen,Dirk Vandermeulen,Peter Claes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a framework combining convolutional autoencoder and Vision Transformer to enhance performance and transparency in dental age estimation models, addressing the "black box" nature of deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes forensic applications, like dental age estimation, require more interpretable and accurate deep learning models due to their critical impact.

Method: The authors propose a framework that integrates convolutional autoencoder (AE) and Vision Transformer (ViT) to improve classification accuracy and diagnostic transparency. They analyzed latent space metrics and reconstructions to understand data-related limitations.

Result: Classification accuracy improved from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38, showing enhanced performance over the baseline ViT. The analysis revealed that data issues, such as high intra-class morphological variability, limit further improvement.

Conclusion: The paper showcases a methodology that not only boosts model accuracy but also provides actionable insights into uncertainty and data-centric limitations, making it highly suitable for forensic expert decision-making.

Abstract: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications,
such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of
the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both
performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance
disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third
(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves
classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from
0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond
improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic
insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions
indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high
intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary
limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single
mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically
plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a
methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model
may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert
decision-making in forensic age estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCoDA, a Source-Free Domain Adaptation method using self-supervised teacher models and focuses on geometric manifold alignment, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional SFDA methods such as reliance on supervised pre-training and loss of geometric manifold information from existing L2-normalized features.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes a teacher model trained via self-supervised learning and incorporates a Space Similarity Loss for geometric manifold alignment. Knowledge transfer occurs with parameters updated using EMA.

Result: Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show SCoDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

Conclusion: SCoDA is shown to be a promising solution for domain adaptation tasks, addressing key challenges in SFDA and achieving better adaptation performance without supervised pre-training.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a
model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain.
Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full
supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features.
However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized
feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the
latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual
Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key
departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised
pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model
pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle
of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained
with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a
Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's
parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's
parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents a zero-shot framework for cell tracking in microscopy videos using the SAM2 model, eliminating the need for labeled datasets and achieving strong performance across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell tracking and mitotic event detection in microscopy videos are essential for biomedical research but are challenging due to issues like indistinct boundaries and dataset variability.

Method: The framework integrates SAM2, a general image and video segmentation model, into a fully unsupervised tracking pipeline, avoiding reliance on manually labeled data and improving generalizability.

Result: The approach demonstrated competitive accuracy in 2D and 3D time-lapse microscopy videos while requiring no fine-tuning or dataset-specific adaptations.

Conclusion: The unsupervised framework effectively addresses challenges in cell tracking, providing a scalable and generalizable solution for diverse microscopy datasets.

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extend 2D multi-camera tracking systems into 3D space using depth information, clustering, and yaw refinement. It achieves notable accuracy on a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D MTMC systems cannot fully leverage the benefits of 3D tracking due to the need to replace components from scratch. This paper aims to bridge this gap by extending 2D systems to the 3D domain efficiently.

Method: The approach uses depth information to convert targets into point-clouds and derives their 3D bounding boxes through clustering and yaw refinement after tracking. It also introduces an improved online data association method for consistent global ID assignment.

Result: The framework was validated on the 2025 AI City Challenge 3D MTMC dataset, where it achieved 3rd place on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates how existing 2D multi-camera tracking systems can be effectively extended to 3D tracking, enhancing surveillance capabilities without the need for ground-up redesigns.

Abstract: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision
task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth
information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering
unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However,
tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the
ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we
present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system
into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in
point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw
refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data
association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to
assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the
2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the
leaderboard.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a zero-shot method for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) that does not rely on task-specific training, demonstrating competitive performance compared to trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of achieving strong performance in REC without the need for task-specific pretraining, simplifying the workflow while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Method: The method reformulates REC as a visual-language verification task, where a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluates True/False queries for region proposals generated by a COCO-trained YOLO-World detector, without fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms both a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline and REC-trained models, such as GroundingDINO and GroundingDINO+CRG, across multiple datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg).

Conclusion: Workflow design, rather than task-specific training, is key to achieving strong zero-shot performance in REC, suggesting broader applicability for similar tasks.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with
task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any
REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our
approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given
proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose
VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple
procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple
matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our
method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds
reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG.
Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification
significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open
VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific
pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

*Tianqi Wei,Xin Yu,Zhi Chen,Scott Chapman,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses difficulties in segmentation of wheat foliar diseases and insect damage by proposing a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation for crop management is hindered by extreme pixel-level imbalance, making insect damage hard to learn while overfitting common classes.

Method: The method extracts and transforms insect-damage patches, pasting them strategically using geometric transformations and random projection filters to maintain natural blending.

Result: Experiments demonstrate substantial improvement in insect damage segmentation performance without compromising other category accuracies.

Conclusion: RPCP augmentation effectively mitigates pixel imbalance, presenting a direct and impactful solution for agricultural image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is
crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect
damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This
extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation
performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient
learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper,
we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to
address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare
insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric
transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted
in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged
regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted
regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new
background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves
segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even
slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance,
offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation
problems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to improve long-term multi-object tracking (MOT), particularly for applications like livestock tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT systems are prone to identity switches over extended tracking periods, reducing their effectiveness in long-term applications, especially where sporadic identifications are available (e.g., livestock tracking systems).

Method: The authors integrate sporadic, uncertain identity data with object tracking using an HMM framework, which enhances the ability to track objects accurately over longer durations.

Result: The HMM framework improved the F1 score of ByteTrack on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset, demonstrating robust performance even under uncertain identifications. It also showed effectiveness on diverse benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20.

Conclusion: The HMM-based approach effectively boosts long-term MOT performance, particularly by leveraging sporadic identity data, and shows robustness and scalability across datasets. The corresponding code and dataset are open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the
demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes.
Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking
performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them
difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world
applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain
sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To
address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that
combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals,
our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach
even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21
identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is
robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as
identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM
framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using
both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new
10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:

*Siying Liu,Zikai Wang,Hanle Zheng,Yifan Hu,Xilin Wang,Qingkai Yang,Jibin Wu,Hao Guo,Lei Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISTASTrack, a hybrid ANN-SNN RGB-Event object tracker that integrates transformer-based architectures and novel adapters for improved visual tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of fully exploiting sparse and asynchronous event streams in RGB-Event tracking through hybrid ANN-SNN approaches.

Method: The model uses two branches: a vision transformer for spatial context extraction and a spiking transformer for spatio-temporal dynamics. A novel ISTA adapter ensures effective bidirectional interaction between ANN and SNN features.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ISTASTrack's state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, with high energy efficiency.

Conclusion: Hybrid ANN-SNN designs with effective feature fusion, like ISTASTrack, are practical and effective for robust visual tracking.

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: Current solar flare forecasting methods are insufficient and struggle with severe class imbalance, which impacts accurate predictions.

Method: The study introduces a model leveraging multiple deep state space models and a new loss function called FLARE loss to enhance forecasting performance and reliability.

Result: Experiments on 11 years of solar image data showed improved forecasting performance using the proposed model, achieving better scores on standard metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances solar flare prediction reliability and outperforms existing models, offering a valuable tool for infrastructure impact mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate
potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance
of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task
of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the
next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe
class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar
flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition,
we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss)
to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance.
Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a
full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed
baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the
true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance
and reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VIO pipeline optimized for micro- and nano-UAVs, utilizing advanced feature tracking methods tailored for ultra-low-power RISC-V systems, achieving better accuracy and lower errors (up to 3.65x RMSE reduction with ORB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines suitable for computationally powerful systems and the need for lightweight implementations for ultra-low-power microcontrollers used in micro- and nano-UAVs.

Method: The proposed pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), optimized for RISC-V-based SoCs. A rigid body motion model is utilized to improve accuracy in planar motion. The pipeline's real-world performance is validated on an ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9).

Result: The optimized pipeline demonstrated an RMSE reduction of up to 3.65x over the baseline when using the ORB feature tracker. PX4FLOW achieved comparable accuracy to ORB but required lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.

Conclusion: The study successfully creates a lightweight and efficient VIO pipeline optimized for resource-constrained devices, making high-accuracy VIO feasible on microcontrollers without compromising performance or accuracy.

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips
(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline
reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an
ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy
after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

*Xiaodong Guo,Tong Liu,Yike Li,Zi'ang Lin,Zhihong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents TUNI, an efficient RGB-T semantic segmentation approach that unifies multimodal feature extraction and fusion while reducing computational costs and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited thermal feature extraction, suboptimal cross-modal fusion, and reduced real-time efficiency in existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models.

Method: This paper introduces the TUNI model, which employs an RGB-T encoder built with stacked blocks for simultaneous multimodal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. It integrates large-scale pre-training using RGB and pseudo-thermal data, a slimmed-down thermal branch for a compact architecture, and an RGB-T local module that uses adaptive cosine similarity for enhancing local feature fusion.

Result: TUNI demonstrates competitive performance on FMB, PST900, and CART datasets with lower parameter and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, validating its real-time deployment capability.

Conclusion: TUNI efficiently integrates RGB-T feature extraction and fusion into a unified system, achieving strong performance and real-time potential while addressing computational and thermal feature extraction limitations.

Abstract: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental
perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models
employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and
infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature
fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal
cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the
model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,
with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously
perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging
large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder
learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By
slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact
architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the
encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module
employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent
and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show
that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB,
PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile,
it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its
real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new model for generating fonts using partial character designs instead of complete character shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional font generation methods requiring entire character shapes for few-shot learning.

Method: A few-part-shot font generation model that uses partial design elements to create complete fonts.

Result: The model improves font creation efficiency and provides understanding of the influence of partial designs on complete structures.

Conclusion: The approach enhances font generation capabilities and offers insights into design influence, showing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel model of few-part-shot font generation, which
designs an entire font based on a set of partial design elements, i.e., partial
shapes. Unlike conventional few-shot font generation, which requires entire
character shapes for a couple of character classes, our approach only needs
partial shapes as input. The proposed model not only improves the efficiency of
font creation but also provides insights into how partial design details
influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

Result: MLANet demonstrated effective performance in 3D face reconstruction and alignment tasks across benchmark datasets, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed MLANet approach effectively reconstructs detailed 3D face models, handling the complexities of real-world images and providing significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable
attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential
applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the
complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this
chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the
Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face

geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.
Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and
introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image
feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,
incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available
datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training
process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation
studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC
Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and

TL;DR: This paper introduces LaV-CoT, a framework for improving multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) with interpretability and robust reasoning, showing superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in multilingual and multimodal reasoning capabilities in current vision language models, particularly their limited ability to perform multilingual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

Method: LaV-CoT leverages an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline, a data curation method for generating high-quality multilingual CoT datasets, and a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by multi-aspect rewards.

Result: LaV-CoT provides up to ~9.5% accuracy improvement over open-source models of similar size and surpasses even larger and proprietary models. Its performance is validated on public datasets and real-world data through evaluations and online A/B testing.

Conclusion: LaV-CoT advances multilingual multimodal reasoning in mVQA by providing scalability, interpretability, and superior performance, making it well-suited for industrial applications.

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in
multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability
and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on
textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning,
constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap,
we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework
with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable
multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box
(BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and
Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an
automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations
through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and
high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT
adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by
verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural
accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets
including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up
to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar
size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%.
Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513
and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our
method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial
deployment. Our code is available at this link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel, training-free framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and text embedding manipulation to enhance color alignment in text-to-image generation, addressing issues with ambiguous color terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with accurately rendering nuanced and compound color terms in text-to-image generation, which is crucial for specific applications like fashion or product visualization.

Method: The proposed method resolves ambiguous color terms using a large language model (LLM), refines the text embeddings spatially in CIELAB color space, and avoids reliance on additional training or external reference images.

Result: The framework significantly enhances color fidelity in generated images without compromising image quality, surpassing prior methods in handling ambiguous color terms.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between textual semantics and visual generation, offering improved color alignment without requiring additional training or resources.

Abstract: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for
applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet
current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g.,
Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned
with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation,
reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous
color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we
propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a
large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding
color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method
first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in
the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial
relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike
prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring
additional training or external reference images. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising
image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and
area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models

introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal
mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting
tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic,
and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions
captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The
data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects
real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the
constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent
VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their
success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the
reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant
limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and
suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in
addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of pre-built HD maps and local map construction modules in trajectory prediction, particularly their inability to adapt to transient changes or capture critical environmental details accurately.

Method: The proposed BEVTraj framework directly utilizes real-time sensor data in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and employs deformable attention for efficient context extraction. It introduces the Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module for end-to-end prediction without post-processing.

Result: BEVTraj achieves results on par with state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering the flexibility of not depending on pre-built maps. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: BEVTraj provides a flexible and accurate trajectory prediction framework for autonomous driving, overcoming reliance on traditional HD maps and offering robust real-time environmental understanding.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe
and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches
often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map
construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However,
pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient
changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only
predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce
errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory
prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space
utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The
BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context
from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate
Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without
requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models
while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built
maps. The source code is available at https://github.com/Kongminsang/bevtraj.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel training framework utilizing multi-view information to enhance multi-human parsing, specifically for scenarios with overlapping bodies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge where state-of-the-art multi-human parsing methods struggle to segment overlapping bodies effectively.

Method: The method involves incorporating multi-view information during training with weak supervision on human instances, a multi-view consistency loss, and a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D skeletons.

Result: The approach shows up to a 4.20% relative improvement in human parsing performance under occlusion scenarios compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances multi-human parsing performance in occluded environments, leveraging multi-view insights effectively.

Abstract: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while
associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and
part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we
demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on
public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with
overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear
separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework
exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under
occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process,
introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a
multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the
literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human
instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.
The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\%
relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight and efficient face image quality assessment (FIQA) method designed to work in real-world, uncontrolled environments using an ensemble of compact models and a correlation-aware loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of general-purpose image quality assessment techniques which fail to capture face-specific degradations, and to offer a computationally efficient FIQA model suitable for practical deployment.

Method: The approach integrates MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2 using prediction-level fusion (via averaging), and introduces a correlation-aware loss involving MSE and Pearson correlation regularizer to align with human perceptual judgments.

Result: The proposed method achieves high accuracy with an SRCC of 0.9829 and a PLCC of 0.9894 on the VQualA FIQA benchmark, while staying computationally efficient.

Conclusion: This lightweight FIQA method balances accuracy and computational cost effectively, making it a viable option for deployment in real-world face recognition systems.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face
recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world
environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose
no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture
face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be
computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a
lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual
evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of
two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2,
with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with
human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss),
combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our
method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost,
making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA
benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient
(PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

### [117] [Realism Control One-step Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10122)
*Zongliang Wu,Siming Zheng,Peng-Tao Jiang,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOD improves image super-resolution by controlling the trade-off between fidelity and realism in one-step diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing one-step diffusion (OSD) methods for image super-resolution that struggle to balance fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios.

Method: RCOD employs a latent domain grouping strategy for explicit fidelity-realism control, degradation-aware sampling for alignment and enhancement, and visual prompt injections for improved restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.

Result: The proposed framework surpasses state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while also allowing flexible realism control during inference.

Conclusion: RCOD provides an effective framework for real-world image super-resolution, offering superior performance and flexible fidelity-realism control without significant computational costs.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image
super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions.
While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency
compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in
balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR
are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible
control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which
are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling
steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step
Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping
strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during
the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and
original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also
introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and
enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection
module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware
visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.
Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD
outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and
visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference
stage. The code will be released.

*Rini Smita Thakur,Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Grad-CL, a source-free domain adaptation method to improve optic disc and cup segmentation across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance drop in segmentation models when applied to datasets with different imaging protocols.

Method: Grad-CL employs gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement and cosine similarity-based contrastive learning for domain adaptation.

Result: Grad-CL shows superior segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation compared to state-of-the-art methods across challenging fundus imaging datasets.

Conclusion: Grad-CL effectively enables robust adaptation of segmentation models without needing source data access, improving ocular disease diagnosis and management.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early
diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However,
segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance
degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging
protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that
leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly
adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source
data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a
cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage,
salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism,
enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype
estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive
loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class
separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc.
Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets
demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy
and improved boundary delineation. Project and code are available at

### [119] [Scalable Training for Vector-Quantized Networks with 100% Codebook Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10140)
*Yifan Chang,Jie Qin,Limeng Qiao,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Lin Ma,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in vector quantization (VQ) for image generation, proposing VQBridge to optimize codebook usage and stability, achieving 100% codebook utilization and improved image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and inefficiency of vector quantization training in discrete tokenizers for image generation, which leads to suboptimal performance and sparse codebook usage.

Method: Propose VQBridge—a projector using a compress-process-recover pipeline and learning annealing—optimizing vector quantization networks for stable training and high codebook usage.

Result: Achieved 100% codebook usage across configurations, state-of-the-art reconstruction, scalability with codebook size, and performance enhancement in image generation models like LlamaGen.

Conclusion: VQBridge effectively resolves VQ training challenges, enhances reconstruction and generative performance, and emphasizes the importance of quality tokenizers for autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image
generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through
estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which
lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this
work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet
effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during
learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust,
scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge
optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling
stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning
annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook
configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable:
it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves
state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger
codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective
across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ
significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual
autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID,
highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong
autoregressive image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerLock leverages a progressive layer freezing strategy for self-supervised visual representation learning, improving efficiency and scalability for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and scalability of video masked-autoencoding models while addressing challenges like representation collapse.

Method: Progressive layer freezing based on the observation that ViT layers converge at different rates during training, alongside a latent prediction schedule.

Result: Demonstrated scalability to large models with up to 4 billion parameters, achieving superior results compared to traditional non-latent masked prediction on 4DS perception suite.

Conclusion: LayerLock is a simple yet effective approach for enabling latent prediction in visual representation learning, making it suitable for large-scale models.

Abstract: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised
visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent
prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation
that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers
converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper
layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to
accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an
explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be
used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not
suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach,
LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those
of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

*Elias De Smijter,Renaud Detry,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares implicit and explicit methods for 3D object reconstruction in space applications, emphasizing the role of appearance embeddings. It concludes that embeddings improve appearance but not geometry accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the role of appearance embeddings and their impact on geometric accuracy for space robotics and safety-focused tasks.

Method: Comparison of methods including K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting using the SPEED+ dataset for systematic evaluation.

Result: Embeddings improve photometric fidelity but do not enhance geometric accuracy. Convex splatting provides more compact representations suitable for safety-critical tasks.

Conclusion: Appearance embeddings are limited in advancing geometric accuracy, and there are crucial trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space applications.

Abstract: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel
View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the
role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by
modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful
gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics
applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian
Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily
reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than
enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact
and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages
for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance.
Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric
tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and
representation efficiency in space scenarios.

*Haozhen Yan,Yan Hong,Suning Lang,Jiahui Zhan,Yikun Ji,Yujie Gao,Jun Lan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GAMMA, a novel training framework for detecting AI-generated images with improved cross-domain generalization and state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI image detectors struggle to generalize to unseen generative models due to reliance on specific artifacts like stylistic or compression patterns.

Method: The GAMMA framework employs diverse manipulation strategies, multi-task supervision with dual segmentation and classification heads, and a reverse cross-attention mechanism.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the GenImage benchmark with a 5.8% accuracy improvement and demonstrated robustness on new models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: GAMMA effectively reduces domain biases, enhances semantic alignment, and improves generalizability in detecting AI-generated images.

Abstract: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse,
detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While
existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on
in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative
models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance
on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression
patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training
framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA
introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based
manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency
between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision
with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level
source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse
cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to
guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage
benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on
newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

*Ema Masterl,Tina Vipotnik Vesnaver,Žiga Špiclin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods for fetal brain MRI scans, focusing on their impact on image quality, volumetric analysis, and diagnostic tasks, highlighting NeSVoR’s robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of low-resolution fetal brain MRI and its impact on volumetric analysis and diagnostic accuracy, particularly for pathological conditions.

Method: Applied three SRR methods - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to analyze 140 fetal brain MRI scans, segmented key brain structures, and compared visual quality, volumetric consistency, and diagnostic performance.

Result: NeSVoR achieved the highest reconstruction success (>90%) across healthy and pathological cases. While volumetric differences were noted among methods, diagnostic performance remained unaffected.

Conclusion: NeSVoR is robust for fetal brain MRI reconstruction, and diagnostic accuracy is stable despite volumetric discrepancies across SRR methods.

Abstract: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce
motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically
low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately
capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to
address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and
super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While
several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance -
particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream
volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study,
we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to
140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and
pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was
segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain
structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric
measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR
demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%)
across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric
estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM
was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's
robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced
volumetric variability.

*Hua Yuan,Jin Yuan,Yicheng Jiang,Yao Zhang,Xin Geng,Yong Rui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in object removal for image inpainting by proposing a novel Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR) technique to mitigate mask hallucination and shape bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models face issues like irrelevant content generation and shape bias in mask-based image inpainting.

Method: The proposed method—Mask Consistency Regularization—uses perturbed masks via dilation and reshaping during training to enforce output consistency and reduce bias.

Result: MCR successfully reduces hallucinations and mask-shape dependency, delivering enhanced context-aware image inpainting.

Conclusion: MCR improves object removal accuracy and produces coherent inpainting results, showing promise as an advancement in image editing techniques.

Abstract: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves
seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding
context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face
two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model
generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the
second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object
that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these
issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training
strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our
approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing
consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original
mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding
content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias.
This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and
contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR
significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved
performance in object removal.

*Jia Wang,Jie Hu,Xiaoqi Ma,Hanghang Ma,Yanbing Zeng,Xiaoming Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MagicMirror, a framework designed to systematically evaluate image artifacts in text-to-image (T2I) generation, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the issue of physical artifacts like anatomical and structural flaws in T2I-generated images, which degrade perceptual quality and hinder application. Existing benchmarks lack a systematic framework for assessing these artifacts.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy for image artifacts, annotate a large dataset (MagicData340K) with fine-grained labels, train a Vision-Language Model (MagicAssessor) with novel data strategies, and establish an automated benchmark (MagicBench) for T2I artifact evaluation.

Result: Using the MagicBench benchmark, the authors demonstrate that even advanced T2I models, such as GPT-image-1, exhibit significant artifacts. Their framework successfully identifies and evaluates these issues.

Conclusion: The presented work highlights the importance of reducing artifacts in T2I models and establishes MagicMirror as a critical tool for future development and evaluation in this domain.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in
instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the
prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,
which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the
diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained
evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To
fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for
artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image
artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the
first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with
fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and
corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward
hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward
system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage
MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating
the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench
reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like
GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting
artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development. Project

*Wenfang Wu,Tingting Yuan,Yupeng Li,Daling Wang,Xiaoming Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignClip introduces a novel framework for sign language translation that incorporates manual and non-manual features like hand gestures and lip movements, achieving superior results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance inclusive communication by improving sign language translation, recognizing the importance of non-manual cues such as mouthing.

Method: SignClip fuses spatial gesture and lip movement features, employing a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives to ensure semantic consistency across different modalities.

Result: SignClip improves BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores, outperforming previous models like SpaMo on PHOENIX14T dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating manual and non-manual cues significantly enhances sign language translation accuracy, highlighting mouthing's linguistic importance.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign
language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While
recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models,
most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to
overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential
linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in
disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a
novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses
manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement
features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency
across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from
24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

TL;DR: The paper studies the efficacy of large vision-language models (VLMs) in detecting text manipulation, identifying challenges in generalization capabilities and performance differences between open and closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior research has shown VLMs to be effective in detecting image manipulations, their capacity to detect text manipulation remains unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors evaluate closed- and open-source VLMs on various text manipulation datasets, including benchmarks on both in-the-wild scene texts and fantasy ID cards, simulating real-world misuse scenarios.

Result: The findings indicate that open-source VLMs are improving in text manipulation detection but remain inferior to closed-source models like GPT-4. Additionally, image manipulation-specialized VLMs face generalization challenges in text manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Despite open-source advancements, closed-source VLMs maintain superiority, and specialized image-focused VLMs struggle to generalize to text manipulation scenarios. This underscores the need for improved modeling strategies.

Abstract: Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models
(VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation
detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by
analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets.
Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still
behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image
manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show
that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for
manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where
the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops MCL-AD, a framework for zero-shot 3D anomaly detection using multimodal learning with point clouds, RGB images, and textual semantics to achieve improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of 3D anomaly detection in zero-shot settings, aiming to reduce reliance on labeled training data and exploit multimodal information for enhanced detection accuracy.

Method: Introduced a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) and a collaborative modulation mechanism (CMM) to enhance intra-modal and inter-modal learning between point clouds, RGB images, and textual cues.

Result: Experiments show that MCL-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: MCL-AD effectively integrates multimodal data to overcome the limitations of existing methods and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth to enhance model robustness against adversarial attacks while preserving accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models like Vision Transformers achieve high performance but are susceptible to adversarial attacks; traditional defenses are either computationally expensive or lack robust guarantees.

Method: The method adjusts DropPath probabilities based on network depth to control the Lipschitz constant, regularizing deeper layers for better defense against adversarial attacks.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with Vision Transformers demonstrate improved adversarial robustness, approximate baseline accuracy, and significant computation savings compared to other DropPath strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth method proves effective, addressing both robustness and computational issues without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art
performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack
formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath)
method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective
Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers,
improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent
schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under
FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to
baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a probabilistic framework using energy maps for precise geolocation of street furniture in urban environments, enhancing monitoring and maintenance through contextual integration of geographic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise geolocation of street furniture is essential for monitoring and maintaining public infrastructure in urban areas, where traditional methods may lack accuracy due to complex environments.

Method: A probabilistic framework based on energy maps is developed, alongside a stochastic birth-and-death optimisation algorithm, allowing integration of external geospatial data for enhanced localisation.

Result: Evaluation of the method is performed using a simulation based on Dublin's street lighting infrastructure, showcasing scalability and accuracy for mapping urban assets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and algorithm significantly improve urban asset mapping accuracy and scalability, and the implementation is openly accessible via GitHub.

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street
furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective
monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and
private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based
on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations.
Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the
optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information,
such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves
contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death
optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration
of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a
geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre,
demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The
implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repository

Motivation: Despite generating high-quality images and videos, diffusion transformers require excessive computational resources due to their iterative denoising process. Addressing this inefficiency is crucial for broader application.

Method: ClusCa employs spatial clustering on token features in each timestep, reducing token count by over 90%. This process propagates cluster information to other tokens, complementing temporal caching approaches.

Result: ClusCa demonstrated a 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model in performance metrics while maintaining quality. Extensive tests verified effectiveness across text-to-image and text-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: ClusCa significantly accelerates diffusion transformers without requiring additional training efforts, making it applicable across models and offering a practical solution for reducing computation costs efficiently.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for
their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from
a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,
feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by
caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the
following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models
while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we
introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and
complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa
performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token
in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which
is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on
DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image
and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any
diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa
achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing
the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at

### [132] [I-Segmenter: Integer-Only Vision Transformer for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10334)
*Jordan Sassoon,Michal Szczepanski,Martyna Poreba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents I-Segmenter, the first integer-only Vision Transformer framework for semantic segmentation, addressing the computational and memory efficiency challenges of deploying ViTs on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation on resource-limited devices faces challenges due to high computational costs and memory footprints. Existing quantization techniques are inadequate for ViT-based segmentation models as they are highly sensitive to precision errors.

Method: I-Segmenter replaces floating-point operations with integer-only ones in the Segmenter architecture. It introduces $\lambda$-ShiftGELU (a novel activation function) to stabilize training and inference, removes L2 normalization, and substitutes bilinear interpolation with nearest neighbor upsampling.

Result: I-Segmenter achieves an accuracy reduction of 5.1% compared to FP32 baselines while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and improving inference speed by 1.2x. It performs competitively even with one-shot post-training quantization using a single calibration image.

Conclusion: I-Segmenter demonstrates the feasibility of performing semantic segmentation using integer-only Vision Transformer models, making them more practical for deployment on resource-constrained devices without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic
segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization
offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation
models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors
accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the
first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter
architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations
with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and
inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that
mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed
activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and
replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,
ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive
experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin
of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to
3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably,
even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers
competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

### [133] [GARD: Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising for Retinal OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10341)
*Botond Fazekas,Thomas Pinetz,Guilherme Aresta,Taha Emre,Hrvoje Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GARD, a novel deep learning method for despeckling OCT images, leveraging diffusion probabilistic models tailored for speckle noise with enhanced methods for noise handling and accelerated inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speckle noise degrades OCT images, obscuring details required for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases, and existing methods fail to balance noise reduction with preserving anatomical structures.

Method: The paper proposes GARD, a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model that reflects the statistical nature of speckle noise, alongside a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term for maintaining fine details and an accelerated inference adaptation.

Result: GARD outperformed traditional methods and advanced models in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE on noisy OCT datasets. Visual results showed sharper edges and better anatomical detail preservation.

Conclusion: GARD effectively addresses speckle noise in OCT, offering significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing denoising techniques.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better
preserves fine anatomical details.

### [134] [GLAM: Geometry-Guided Local Alignment for Multi-View VLP in Mammography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10344)
*Yuexi Du,Lihui Chen,Nicha C. Dvornek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLAM, a new visual language model designed for mammography, addressing limitations in adapting natural image VLMs to medical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mammography VLMs fail to incorporate crucial geometric and multi-view relationships, which radiologists traditionally use for analysis, resulting in compromised prediction accuracy.

Method: GLAM leverages geometric knowledge from the mammography process by utilizing cross-view alignments and contrastive learning methods to enhance global and local feature understanding.

Result: GLAM, when pretrained on the EMBED dataset, outperforms existing models across multiple datasets and diverse settings.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAM model improves prediction by incorporating mammography-specific characteristics, advancing visual language models for medical applications.

Abstract: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast
cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential
to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a
foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain
differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs,
adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such
as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze
both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods
treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view
correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in
suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for
Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By
leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of
mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local
features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language
contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open
mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets
under different settings.

### [135] [Towards Understanding Visual Grounding in Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10345)

TL;DR: This paper reviews approaches to visual grounding in vision-language models (VLMs), summarizing methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore visual grounding capabilities in VLMs, which enable models to connect textual descriptions with specific visual regions, benefiting various fine-grained tasks and applications.

Method: The method involves surveying key works in modern VLMs, analyzing their components, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and interrelations among visual grounding, reasoning, and multimodal chain-of-thought.

Result: The paper systematically classifies and critiques advancements, applications, and interplay of key aspects in grounding VLMs.

Conclusion: Visual grounding plays a crucial role in VLM development. The paper underscores existing challenges and highlights promising research directions for improving grounded multimodal systems.

Abstract: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within
some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model
equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of
applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,
answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,
caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and
high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we
review representative works across the key areas of research on modern
general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance
of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary
paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical
applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising
directions for future research.

*Matteo Trippodo,Federico Becattini,Lorenzo Seidenari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Attention Attack, a novel adversarial method against text-based image editing tools, disrupting cross-attention using image captions as proxies for editing prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of fine-grained text-based image editing methods to adversarial attacks.

Method: The proposed attack interferes with cross-attention mechanisms by replacing edit prompts with automatically generated captions, disrupting alignment between text and images.

Result: Experiments using TEDBench++ showed significant degradation in editing performance while maintaining imperceptibility of the attack.

Conclusion: Attention Attack effectively compromises editing reliability without requiring prior knowledge of editing methods, offering novel evaluation strategies like Caption Similarity and semantic IoU.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained
manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such
methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce
Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt
and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated
caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the
alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,
without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.
Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we
propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies
semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic
Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via
segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark
demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while
remaining imperceptible.

### [137] [Efficient Learned Image Compression Through Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10366)
*Fabien Allemand,Attilio Fiandrotti,Sumanta Chaudhuri,Alaa Eddine Mazouz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies knowledge distillation to develop smaller, more efficient neural networks for learned image compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional learned image compression methods outperform traditional codecs but demand high processing power, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The study utilizes knowledge distillation to train smaller neural networks on partially processed outputs from larger models, optimizing performance for image compression while reducing computational demand.

Result: Knowledge distillation proved effective for improving performance across different model sizes and compression trade-offs, while also conserving resources.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of knowledge distillation to make learned image compression more feasible, while proposing future avenues for exploration, including adapting to transformer-based models and alternative configurations.

Abstract: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and
image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based
compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to
a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a
binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the
bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of
the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently
outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing
power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained
platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This
study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for
image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm
where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more
complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.
Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to
image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve
different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and
energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,
and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as
well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be
extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:

*Zeqing Leo Yuan,Mani Ramanagopal,Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan,Srinivasa G. Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free method for intrinsic image decomposition using visible and thermal image pairs, achieving superior results compared to learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of intrinsic image decomposition due to the lack of extensive real-world ground-truth data.

Method: Utilizes ordinalities between visible and thermal images to self-supervise a neural network, avoiding reliance on synthetic data or sparse annotations.

Result: The method achieves quantitative and qualitative success in recovering shading and reflectance, especially in diverse outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The approach offers improved performance over learning-based models and a scalable way to curate real-world ordinal supervision.

Abstract: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and
reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive
ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data
or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We
introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition
using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that
light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by
a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and
thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which
can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and
reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and
shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments
across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance
over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating
real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

Method: The study introduces a novel taxonomy for CVQE methods, proposes a unified benchmarking framework for fair evaluation, and conducts a systematic analysis of performance versus computational complexity trade-offs.

Result: It provides insights and tools for structured evaluation and performance optimization of CVQE methods, establishing clear trade-offs and highlighting areas for future advancements.

Conclusion: The paper aims to create a comprehensive foundation for consistent evaluation and better model selection in CVQE research, helping to advance the field.

Abstract: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user
experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC.
While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing
surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification
linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative
analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped
benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key
contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods
across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature
utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating
modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair
multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the
critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational
complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising
directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a
foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE
research and deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM SAM-adapter, a new framework for multimodal semantic segmentation that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to effectively integrate auxiliary sensor data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic segmentation methods struggle in challenging conditions (e.g., poor lighting, occlusions), prompting the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional sensor data to enhance robustness.

Method: The proposed MM SAM-adapter uses an adapter network to inject fused multimodal features into SAM's RGB-based features, balancing generalization with modality-specific contributions for robust segmentation.

Result: MM SAM-adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks—DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES—and demonstrates consistent superiority under both favorable and adverse conditions on RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets.

Conclusion: The MM SAM-adapter framework highlights the benefits of multimodal adaptation in improving robustness for semantic segmentation tasks, offering a promising way to leverage auxiliary sensor data in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfGen, a method to significantly speed up high-resolution image generation using latent diffusion models by proposing a one-step generator that produces images at arbitrary resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies in current diffusion models, particularly the significant delays in generating 4K images.

Method: InfGen enhances latent diffusion models by replacing the traditional VAE decoder with a one-step generator that generates high-resolution images from compact latent representations.

Result: InfGen reduces 4K image generation time from over 100 seconds to under 10 seconds, showcasing improved speed and applicability for any model using the same latent space.

Conclusion: InfGen facilitates arbitrary high-resolution image generation while simplifying the process and substantially decreasing computational complexity, making it adaptable and scalable.

Abstract: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience
across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers.
Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with
resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this,
we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the
fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content
representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a
compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the
\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for
generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining
the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational
complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.
Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary
high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes
memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in
applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models
remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across

robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets
comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our
model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis
classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.
Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and
contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven
downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across
tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Setchain, a blockchain scalability solution that organizes elements in unordered epochs. Three algorithms (Vanilla, Compresschain, Hashchain) are proposed, showing increased throughput and low latency compared to traditional blockchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address blockchain scalability issues by reducing the total order requirement among transactions and organizing them into unordered epochs.

Method: Three algorithms, Vanilla, Compresschain, and Hashchain, are built on the CometBFT platform to implement Setchain. These algorithms include support for epoch-proofs to ensure verification and utilize server clusters for performance evaluation.

Result: The Setchain algorithms significantly improve throughput compared to the traditional blockchain and achieve transaction finality with latency of under 4 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed Setchain algorithms provide scalable and efficient blockchain solutions, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in throughput while maintaining low latency.

Abstract: Setchain has been proposed to increase blockchain scalability by relaxing the
strict total order requirement among transactions. Setchain organizes elements
into a sequence of sets, referred to as epochs, so that elements within each
epoch are unordered. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three distinct
Setchain algorithms, that leverage an underlying block-based ledger. Vanilla is
a basic implementation that serves as a reference point. Compresschain
aggregates elements into batches, and compresses these batches before appending
them as epochs in the ledger. Hashchain converts batches into fixed-length
hashes which are appended as epochs in the ledger. This requires Hashchain to
use a distributed service to obtain the batch contents from its hash. To allow
light clients to safely interact with only one server, the proposed algorithms
maintain, as part of the Setchain, proofs for the epochs. An epoch-proof is the
hash of the epoch, cryptographically signed by a server. A client can verify
the correctness of an epoch with $f+1$ epoch-proofs (where $f$ is the maximum
number of Byzantine servers assumed). All three Setchain algorithms are
implemented on top of the CometBFT blockchain application platform. We
conducted performance evaluations across various configurations, using clusters
of four, seven, and ten servers. Our results show that the Setchain algorithms
reach orders of magnitude higher throughput than the underlying blockchain, and
achieve finality with latency below 4 seconds.

*Yunhao Zhang,Haobin Ni,Soumya Basu,Shir Cohen,Maofan Yin,Lorenzo Alvisi,Robbert van Renesse,Qi Chen,Lidong Zhou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper extends ordered consensus in state machine replication (SMR) to include equal opportunity fairness and introduces the secret random oracle (SRO) to minimize ordering manipulations in blockchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordered manipulations in SMR-based blockchains impact fairness and reward distribution among clients, even without Byzantine replicas, necessitating a more equitable solution.

Method: The authors expand ordered consensus to incorporate an equal opportunity fairness criterion by leveraging randomness through a secret random oracle (SRO), designed using trusted hardware and threshold verifiable random functions, and integrate it into a protocol named Bercow.

Result: The proposed Bercow protocol uses SRO to approximate equal opportunity fairness within a configurable factor, effectively mitigating common ordering attacks in SMR-based blockchains.

Conclusion: Bercow demonstrates that incorporating fairness through randomness-generation methods can significantly reduce bias in blockchain ordering and improve equitable access to rewards in SMR systems.

Abstract: The specification of state machine replication (SMR) has no requirement on
the final total order of commands. In blockchains based on SMR, however, order
matters, since different orders could provide their clients with different
financial rewards. Ordered consensus augments the specification of SMR to
include specific guarantees on such order, with a focus on limiting the
influence of Byzantine nodes. Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can
and do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,
such as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,
that give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this
paper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support
equal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social
sciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,
according to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for
a position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have
an equal chance of landing it. We show how randomness can be leveraged to keep
bias in check, and, to this end, introduce the secret random oracle (SRO), a
system component that generates randomness in a fault-tolerant manner. We
describe two SRO designs based, respectively, on trusted hardware and threshold
verifiable random functions, and instantiate them in Bercow, a new ordered
consensus protocol that, by approximating equal opportunity up to within a
configurable factor, can effectively mitigate well-known ordering attacks in
SMR-based blockchains.

Motivation: The paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs behave when scaled across large systems, addressing the challenge of efficient training in multi-GPU environments.

Method: The authors comprehensively evaluated LLM training on NVIDIA H100/H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs, employing tensor, pipeline, data, and expert parallelism. They analyzed hardware utilization, power and thermal behavior, and optimizations such as activation recomputation.

Result: Scale-up systems with high-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in certain configurations. Some parallelism strategies cause bandwidth inefficiencies, and microbatch size increases can lead to thermal issues. Communication and configuration are critical.

Conclusion: Interactions between hardware, model execution, and system topology shape performance. Recommendations for hardware and system improvements are provided, and the source code is shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has pushed training
workloads far beyond the limits of single-node analysis, demanding a deeper
understanding of how these models behave across large-scale, multi-GPU systems.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of LLM training
across diverse real-world workloads and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA
H100/H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs. We analyze dense and sparse models under various
parallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate
their effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior.
We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation
recomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that
performance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up
systems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in
communication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in
other cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show
that certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to
bandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing
microbatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power
excursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training
performance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system
topology, and model execution. We conclude by offering recommendations for
system and hardware design to improve the scalability and reliability of future
LLM systems and workloads. The source code of this project is available at

### [146] [Structure Matters: Brain Graph Augmentation via Learnable Edge Masking for Data-efficient Psychiatric Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09744)
*Mujie Liu,Chenze Wang,Liping Chen,Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Niharika Tewari,Ting Dang,Jiangang Ma,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAM-BG, a two-stage self-supervised learning framework, for improving psychiatric diagnoses from brain graph data by preserving structural semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate psychiatric diagnoses require labeled brain graph data, but such data is scarce. Existing SSL methods disrupt structural semantics, limiting interpretability and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: The approach uses a two-stage process: (1) Pre-training an edge masker on a small labeled dataset to extract structural semantics, and (2) leveraging these semantics for structure-aware data augmentation in SSL, enhancing representation learning.

Result: SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art models on two real-world psychiatric datasets and is particularly effective with limited labeled data. It also reveals clinically significant connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: SAM-BG addresses challenges in psychiatric diagnosis by balancing structural semantic preservation and robust representation learning, making diagnoses more accurate and interpretable.

Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging
to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods
often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural
semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage
framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic
preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small
labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the
extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process,
enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust
representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate
that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled
data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that
enhance interpretability. Our code is available at

### [147] [D-CAT: Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer between Sensor Modalities for Unimodal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09747)
*Leen Daher,Zhaobo Wang,Malcolm Mielle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a method enabling single-sensor inference for multi-modal classification by aligning modality-specific representations without requiring paired sensor data at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal classification models are crucial in applications like human-robot collaboration, but existing methods needing paired sensor data at inference are impractical in cost-sensitive deployments.

Method: The proposed D-CAT framework uses a self-attention module for feature extraction combined with a cross-attention alignment loss to align modality-specific feature spaces without coupling classification pipelines.

Result: D-CAT achieves up to 10% F1-score improvement in in-distribution scenarios when transferring from high-performing modalities, and improves performance in out-of-distribution scenarios using weaker modalities, provided the target model isn't overfitted.

Conclusion: D-CAT enables accurate single-sensor inference, reducing hardware redundancy and supporting adaptive and cost-sensitive deployments, such as assistive robots, while maintaining classification performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification
models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration).
However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and
inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full
sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we
propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns
modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality
during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature
extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the
alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the
classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three
multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal
models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from
high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains
over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source
modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the
target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor
inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for
perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for
cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with
variable sensor availability). Code is available at
https://github.com/Schindler-EPFL-Lab/D-CAT.

*Junqiao Wang,Zhaoyang Guan,Guanyu Liu,Tianze Xia,Xianzhi Li,Shuo Yin,Xinyuan Song,Chuhan Cheng,Tianyu Shi,Alex Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-RL-Crypto is a self-improving trading agent, combining meta-learning and reinforcement learning to predict cryptocurrency returns and outperform existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency price prediction faces challenges due to complex influences like market activity, news, and sentiment, combined with scarce labeled data.

Method: The paper introduces Meta-RL-Crypto, using a transformer-based architecture integrating meta-learning and RL, featuring an iterative actor-judge-meta-judge process with multimodal inputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Meta-RL-Crypto's strong performance in diverse market conditions and advantages over other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Meta-RL-Crypto effectively refines trading policies and evaluation criteria, addressing the difficulties of cryptocurrency prediction and setting a benchmark in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Predicting cryptocurrency returns is notoriously difficult: price movements
are driven by a fast-shifting blend of on-chain activity, news flow, and social
sentiment, while labeled training data are scarce and expensive. In this paper,
we present Meta-RL-Crypto, a unified transformer-based architecture that
unifies meta-learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to create a fully
self-improving trading agent. Starting from a vanilla instruction-tuned LLM,
the agent iteratively alternates between three roles-actor, judge, and
meta-judge-in a closed-loop architecture. This learning process requires no
additional human supervision. It can leverage multimodal market inputs and
internal preference feedback. The agent in the system continuously refines both
the trading policy and evaluation criteria. Experiments across diverse market
regimes demonstrate that Meta-RL-Crypto shows good performance on the technical
indicators of the real market and outperforming other LLM-based baselines.

### [149] [LAVa: Layer-wise KV Cache Eviction with Dynamic Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09754)
*Yiqun Shen,Song Yuan,Zhengze Zhang,Xiaoliang Wang,Daxin Jiang,Nguyen Cam-Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAVa introduces a unified framework for compressing KV Cache in LLM inference, enabling dynamic allocation of layer and head budgets without additional training, leading to superior results across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high memory demand in KV Cache used for accelerating LLM inference, especially with long contexts, by proposing an effective compression method.

Method: The proposed method minimizes information loss in Transformer residual streams by analyzing attention output loss and contrasting cross-layer information, resulting in dynamic budget allocation for layer and head compression.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show LAVa's superiority in both generation tasks (dynamic layer budgets) and extraction tasks (dynamic head budgets), achieving consistent top performance.

Conclusion: LAVa establishes itself as a fully dynamic compression method for KV Cache, showcasing its effectiveness and versatility without relying on training or combined strategies.

Abstract: KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet
its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing
compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget
allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for
cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual
streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive
a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise
compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer
information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified
strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior
methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies.
Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and
InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a
new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code
completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks
(e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently
maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available at

### [150] [FedBiF: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Bits Freezing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10161)
*Shiwei Li,Qunwei Li,Haozhao Wang,Ruixuan Li,Jianbin Lin,Wenliang Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a new federated learning framework that reduces communication overhead by updating only a single bit of model parameters per round, while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead in federated learning remains a challenge, especially when quantization techniques introduce errors during local training, potentially degrading model performance.

Method: FedBiF quantizes model parameters at the server side before transmission and enables clients to update only one bit per parameter, freezing the rest, which minimizes communication while retaining precision.

Result: Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that FedBiF achieves high communication compression, fosters sparsity in models, and maintains accuracy comparable to FedAvg. Specifically, it uses only 1 bpp for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.

Conclusion: FedBiF provides a highly efficient communication strategy for federated learning without compromising model accuracy, making it a strong alternative for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm
that enables collaborative model training without sharing local data. Despite
its advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can
affect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by
quantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing
methods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization
errors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In
this paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework
that directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each
communication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and
transmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a
single bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining
bits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit
while maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and
Non-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves
superior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting
models. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using
only 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.

### [151] [Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement Learning for Fair Population Health Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09772)
*Sanjay Basu,Sadiq Y. Patel,Parth Sheth,Bhairavi Muralidharan,Namrata Elamaran,Aakriti Kinra,Rajaie Batniji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HACO, a framework combining conformal risk gating with offline reinforcement learning to create safe, auditable, and fair decision support systems for managing Medicaid population health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that ensures safe and auditable population health management decisions while accounting for fairness in risk calibration and optimization.

Method: The approach trains a risk model for predicting adverse events, applies conformal thresholds to mask unsafe decisions, and optimizes action preferences on the safe set. It evaluates policies using fitted Q evaluation and audits demographic subgroup performance.

Result: HACO demonstrates strong risk discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold and maintains high coverage, while subgroup audits highlight the importance of fairness due to systematic demographic differences in policy outcomes.

Conclusion: HACO successfully integrates conformal risk gating with offline RL, providing secure, fair, and scalable tools for Medicaid population health management.

Abstract: Population health management programs for Medicaid populations coordinate
longitudinal outreach and services (e.g., benefits navigation, behavioral
health, social needs support, and clinical scheduling) and must be safe, fair,
and auditable. We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement
Learning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference
optimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our
setting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g.,
which member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a
specialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse
utilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or
hospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark
comprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i)
trains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal
threshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a
preference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a
version-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit
subgroup performance across age, sex, and race. HACO achieves strong risk
discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold ( {\tau} ~0.038 at
{\alpha} = 0.10), while maintaining high safe coverage. Subgroup analyses
reveal systematic differences in estimated value across demographics,
underscoring the importance of fairness auditing. Our results show that
conformal risk gating integrates cleanly with offline RL to deliver
conservative, auditable decision support for population health management
teams.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified system for routing queries to the most suitable large language model (LLM), optimizing for both cost and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable and cost-effective usage of LLMs across diverse queries in real-world applications requires efficient routing techniques.

Method: The authors employ a single-head cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously analyze input queries and model embeddings, predicting which LLM is optimal for each query. This framework is tested using RouterBench, a benchmark covering various LLMs and domains.

Result: This method improves Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) by up to 6.6% and maximum performance by 2.9% compared to existing routers, while balancing performance and cost using an exponential reward function.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is lightweight, domain-generalizable, and efficient, setting a new standard for cost-aware routing of queries across LLMs.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) with varying computational
costs and performance profiles presents a critical challenge for scalable,
cost-effective deployment in real-world applications. We introduce a unified
routing framework that leverages a single-head cross-attention mechanism to
jointly model query and model embeddings, enabling dynamic selection of the
optimal LLM for each input query. Our approach is evaluated on RouterBench, a
large-scale, publicly available benchmark encompassing diverse LLM pools and
domains. By explicitly capturing fine-grained query-model interactions, our
router predicts both response quality and generation cost, achieving up to 6.6%
improvement in Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) and 2.9% in maximum
performance over existing routers. To robustly balance performance and cost, we
propose an exponential reward function that enhances stability across user
preferences. The resulting architecture is lightweight, generalizes effectively
across domains, and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to prior methods,
establishing a new standard for cost-aware LLM routing.

*Vincent Herfeld,Baudouin Denis de Senneville,Arthur Leclaire,Nicolas Papadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the Gradient-Step Denoiser in Plug-and-Play algorithms for optimization, where it is trained to serve as a gradient descent or proximity operator with strong denoising capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the Plug-and-Play optimization paradigm by leveraging a trained Gradient-Step Denoiser that can act as a well-defined operator for an explicit functional, unlike traditional implicit image priors.

Method: The approach involves training the Gradient-Step Denoiser to accurately perform as a gradient descent or a proximity operator. This training preserves its advanced image denoising abilities while integrating it into the Plug-and-Play framework.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the Gradient-Step Denoiser is both effective as an operator of an explicit functional and reliable for state-of-the-art image denoising.

Conclusion: The study validates the utility of using Gradient-Step Denoisers in Plug-and-Play algorithms, combining clear optimization-based representation with high-quality denoising performance.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the Gradient-Step Denoiser and its usage in
Plug-and-Play algorithms. The Plug-and-Play paradigm of optimization algorithms
uses off the shelf denoisers to replace a proximity operator or a gradient
descent operator of an image prior. Usually this image prior is implicit and
cannot be expressed, but the Gradient-Step Denoiser is trained to be exactly
the gradient descent operator or the proximity operator of an explicit
functional while preserving state-of-the-art denoising capabilities.

### [154] [Distinguishing Startle from Surprise Events Based on Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09799)
*Mansi Sharma,Alexandre Duchevet,Florian Daiber,Jean-Paul Imbert,Maurice Rekrut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how physiological signals can be used to distinguish between the reactions of startle and surprise, which impact pilot performance. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in predicting these states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unexpected events impair attention and decision-making, posing risks in high-stakes environments like aviation. Startle and surprise reactions specifically affect pilot performance but remain difficult to differentiate.

Method: The paper uses machine learning and multi-modal fusion strategies to analyze physiological signals and predict different states (Startle, Surprise, and Baseline). Techniques like SVM and XGBoost were employed for this differentiation.

Result: The highest mean accuracy for differentiating Startle vs. Surprise was 85.7% using SVM and Late Fusion, while including Baseline states achieved 74.9% accuracy with XGBoost and Late Fusion.

Conclusion: Physiological signals reliably distinguish between startle, surprise, and baseline states using machine learning methods, addressing an important challenge in aviation safety.

Abstract: Unexpected events can impair attention and delay decision-making, posing
serious safety risks in high-risk environments such as aviation. In particular,
reactions like startle and surprise can impact pilot performance in different
ways, yet are often hard to distinguish in practice. Existing research has
largely studied these reactions separately, with limited focus on their
combined effects or how to differentiate them using physiological data. In this
work, we address this gap by distinguishing between startle and surprise events
based on physiological signals using machine learning and multi-modal fusion
strategies. Our results demonstrate that these events can be reliably
predicted, achieving a highest mean accuracy of 85.7% with SVM and Late Fusion.
To further validate the robustness of our model, we extended the evaluation to
include a baseline condition, successfully differentiating between Startle,
Surprise, and Baseline states with a highest mean accuracy of 74.9% with
XGBoost and Late Fusion.

TL;DR: This paper develops a rigorous extension of rectified flow to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and demonstrates its effectiveness over existing functional generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the extension of rectified flow models to infinite-dimensional settings, as previous generative models generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces while rectified flow models did not.

Method: The paper constructs a functional framework based on the superposition principle for continuity equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, extending functional flow matching and functional probability flow ODEs as nonlinear generalizations.

Result: The extended framework experimentally achieves superior performance compared to existing functional generative models, while removing restrictive measure-theoretic assumptions in prior theories.

Conclusion: The work establishes novel methodologies for applying rectified flow models within infinite-dimensional spaces, paving the way for improved generative modeling approaches and expanding theoretical generalizations.

Abstract: Many generative models originally developed in finite-dimensional Euclidean
space have functional generalizations in infinite-dimensional settings.
However, the extension of rectified flow to infinite-dimensional spaces remains
unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional formulation of
rectified flow in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our approach builds
upon the superposition principle for continuity equations in an
infinite-dimensional space. We further show that this framework extends
naturally to functional flow matching and functional probability flow ODEs,
interpreting them as nonlinear generalizations of rectified flow. Notably, our
extension to functional flow matching removes the restrictive measure-theoretic
assumptions in the existing theory of \citet{kerrigan2024functional}.
Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that our method achieves superior
performance compared to existing functional generative models.

*Reza Asad,Reza Babanezhad,Sharan Vaswani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits the design of discrete-action actor-critic methods and proposes a flexible framework that achieves performance close to DQN in Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing policy-based methods in discrete-action reinforcement learning, which either cannot effectively leverage off-policy data or underperform compared to value-based methods like DQN.

Method: The authors decouple actor and critic entropy in discrete SAC and propose a generalized off-policy actor-critic framework that incorporates m-step Bellman updates and flexible policy optimization objectives.

Result: The proposed methods empirically achieve performance comparable to DQN on Atari games, even without using entropy regularization or explicit exploration.

Conclusion: By addressing entropy coupling and introducing a flexible framework, the paper bridges the performance gap between actor-critic and value-based methods in discrete-action settings.

Abstract: Value-based approaches such as DQN are the default methods for off-policy
reinforcement learning with discrete-action environments such as Atari. Common
policy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from
off-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the
discrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC
(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,
we determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the
primary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by
merely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as
DQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic
framework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an
m-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard
policy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the
resulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods
can guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the
tabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach
the performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy
regularization or explicit exploration.

*Jiajun Shen,Yufei Jin,Yi He,Xingquan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HGEN, an ensemble learning framework for heterogeneous graphs, which incorporates meta-paths and a transformation-based pipeline to improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by heterogeneity in node types, features, and neighborhood topology and to enhance the performance of ensemble learning in heterogeneous graphs.

Method: HGEN employs ensemble learning through meta-path-based Allele Graph Neural Networks, using a residual-attention mechanism for better node embedding alignment and a correlation-regularization term to enhance diversity among base learners.

Result: HGEN achieves superior performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods across five heterogeneous graph datasets.

Conclusion: HGEN is an effective framework that tackles heterogeneity in graphs, offering innovations in ensemble learning that improve classification accuracy and learner diversity.

Abstract: This paper presents HGEN that pioneers ensemble learning for heterogeneous
graphs. We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and
local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,
particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework
ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based
optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN
uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for
later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key
components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of
different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more
informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a
correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding
matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner
diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher
regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous
networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art
competitors by substantial margin.

### [158] [Understanding Outer Optimizers in Local SGD: Learning Rates, Momentum, and Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10439)
*Ahmed Khaled,Satyen Kale,Arthur Douillard,Chi Jin,Rob Fergus,Manzil Zaheer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, proving new convergence guarantees and demonstrating the importance of tuning the outer learning rate and momentum, validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce communication overhead in distributed machine learning systems while preserving convergence performance by understanding the role of the outer learning process in Local SGD.

Method: The researchers theoretically analyzed the impact of the outer learning rate and momentum in Local SGD, improved convergence rates by accelerating the outer optimizer, and introduced a data-dependent analysis. Experiments validated these insights on standard language models.

Result: They showed that tuning the outer learning rate allows for balancing optimization error and noise variance, compensating for poorly tuned inner learning rates, and achieving improved convergence rates with outer acceleration.

Conclusion: The outer optimizer plays a critical role in Local SGD, with proper tuning of the outer learning rate and momentum leading to improved convergence and performance in distributed machine learning.

Abstract: Modern machine learning often requires training with large batch size,
distributed data, and massively parallel compute hardware (like mobile and
other edge devices or distributed data centers). Communication becomes a major
bottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent
(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication
overhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an
aggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates
from the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive
literature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local
optimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is
less clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove
new convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that
tuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization
error and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of
the inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate
should sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to
settings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar
role for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration
in the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a
function of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence
rate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also
introduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further
insights on outer learning rate tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments
with standard language models and various outer optimizers to validate our
theory.

*Jenny Y. Huang,Mehul Damani,Yousef El-Kurdi,Ramon Astudillo,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses improving inference-time efficiency and effectiveness for large language models through dynamic compute strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to scaling inference-time performance often neglect latency considerations and focus solely on token usage.

Method: A framework for dynamic allocation of test-time computing resources and method selection, considering both token costs and wall-clock latency to optimize efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms static strategies in accuracy-cost trade-offs and proves practical for deployment.

Conclusion: Dynamic compute allocation strategies can improve large language model performance while balancing costs and deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large
language model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and
selecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for
test-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as
best-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has
largely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate
inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method
selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much
compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates
both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user
experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue
multiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our
approach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable
accuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.

TL;DR: The paper develops a data-based computing framework for predicting the evolution of dissipative physical systems, even when some phase space variables are unobservable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing the evolution of dissipative systems when some critical phase space variables (momenta and entropies) are not directly observable.

Method: The method involves constructing a thermodynamic Lagrangian and training neural networks designed to adhere to thermodynamic principles, including ensuring non-decreasing entropy.

Result: The proposed neural networks successfully describe phase space evolution using limited observational data and a small computational parameter set.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates efficiency in providing accurate predictions of physical system evolution, respecting the thermodynamic constraints while relying only on observable variables.

Abstract: Much attention has recently been devoted to data-based computing of evolution
of physical systems. In such approaches, information about data points from
past trajectories in phase space is used to reconstruct the equations of motion
and to predict future solutions that have not been observed before. However, in
many cases, the available data does not correspond to the variables that define
the system's phase space. We focus our attention on the important example of
dissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of
coordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot,
in general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an
efficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable
variables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \emph{thermodynamic
Lagrangian}, and constructing neural networks that respect the thermodynamics
and guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution. We show that our network
can provide an efficient description of phase space evolution based on a
limited number of data points and a relatively small number of parameters in
the system.

### [161] [LoFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Long-tailed Semi-Supervised Learning in Open-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09926)
*Jiahao Chen,Zhiyuan Huang,Yurou Liu,Bing Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LoFT, a novel framework for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning leveraging fine-tuned foundation models and addressing open-world scenarios with improved pseudolabeling and out-of-distribution handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudolabels in existing LTSSL methods that train models from scratch.

Method: Proposed LoFT framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models and extended it to handle open-world scenarios.

Result: LoFT demonstrated superior performance on benchmarks, even while using only 1% labeled data compared to previous works.

Conclusion: LoFT offers a promising update for LTSSL by utilizing fine-tuned foundation models and effectively addressing open-world semi-supervised learning challenges.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed
Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by
incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled
dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from
scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality
pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation
model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed
semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate
that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels,
thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more
practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world
conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World
scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled
data compared with previous works.

### [162] [Multi-Play Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09933)
*Shintaro Nakamura,Yuko Kuroki,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-Play Combinatorial Semi-Bandit (MP-CSB) framework, extending CSB problems to non-negative integer flows and allocations, and provides two novel algorithms with strong performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations of the traditional CSB framework, which is restricted to binary decision spaces and thus excludes key combinatorial problems such as optimal transport and knapsack problems.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm for large action spaces with logarithmic regret in the stochastic regime, and a best-of-both-worlds algorithm with strong performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes, having adaptable and data-dependent regret.

Result: The algorithms achieve improved theoretical guarantees, including logarithmic and variance-dependent regret in stochastic regimes, and data-adaptive bounds in adversarial regimes. Experimental results showcase superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This work addresses a significant limitation of CSB problems by introducing the MP-CSB framework, demonstrating theoretical and numerical advantages, and broadening the applicability to real-world combinatorial optimization scenarios.

Abstract: In the combinatorial semi-bandit (CSB) problem, a player selects an action
from a combinatorial action set and observes feedback from the base arms
included in the action. While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial
optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes
important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as
the optimal transport and knapsack problems.To overcome this limitation, we
propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can
select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a
single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a
Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when
the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and
attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime,
where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm,
which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime
and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent,
adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic
variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically
show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB
literature.

*Saarth Gaonkar,Xiang Zheng,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Kurt Keutzer,Dmitriy Morozov,Michael W. Mahoney,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of LLMs as agents for generating scientifically appropriate code to solve ODE problems, without directly tuning solution functions, by leveraging numerical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust and accurate methods to solve scientific computing tasks using machine learning, particularly with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Existing approaches face challenges in accuracy, prompting exploration of alternative methods utilizing LLMs.

Method: The authors introduced two datasets—a diagnostic adversarial set and a benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks—and evaluated LLMs on their ability to generate runnable, numerically valid code. Models were tested using unguided vs. guided prompting, and off-the-shelf vs. fine-tuned versions, comparing executability and accuracy against reference solutions.

Result: Instruction-following LLMs achieve high accuracy when given adequate prompts and context. Open-source systems often perform well without fine-tuning, whereas older or smaller models benefit significantly from fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that LLMs, with proper guidance and fine-tuning, can reliably generate runnable and scientifically valid solutions for simple ODE problems, highlighting their potential in scientific machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks
directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g.,
physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but
attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an
alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical
algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making
domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents
that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is
scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),
and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this
kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce
two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems;
and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set
contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that
require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the
large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-
and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided
prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus
fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical
validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and
guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on
both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly
without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from
fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting
and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving
simple ODE problems.

*Yifei Wang,Wenbin Wang,Yong Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyKen-Hyena, a model for Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR), achieving state-of-the-art results by using token-level modulation rather than traditional feature fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal intent recognition risk corrupting primary linguistic features due to noisy or conflicting information from audio-visual modalities.

Method: The proposed DyKen-Hyena model dynamically modulates textual features by translating audio-visual cues into token-specific convolutional kernels.

Result: DyKen-Hyena demonstrated a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach improves intent recognition by refining how non-verbal signals interact with textual meaning, leading to a more robust representation and enhanced performance.

Abstract: Though Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR) proves effective by utilizing rich
information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the
potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities
may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt
to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal
feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original
representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features
with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the
fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not
just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which
reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model
translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that
directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks.
Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection,
validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent
representation.

*Omar Erak,Omar Alhussein,Hatem Abou-Zeid,Mehdi Bennis,Sami Muhaidat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel training-free framework for adaptive token merging in transformers, reducing computational and communication costs while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges in high computational and communication costs, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: A training-free adaptive token merging approach is proposed, using per-layer similarity thresholds to compress transformer representations dynamically. Bayesian optimization is employed for multi-objective trade-offs.

Result: On ImageNet classification, the method achieved 30% fewer FLOPS and 80% communication cost reduction. In visual question answering tasks, efficiency improved with reduced compute and bandwidth usage.

Conclusion: Adaptive merging offers practical and robust solutions for edge scenarios, maintaining accuracy while enhancing efficiency, privacy, and adaptability to channel conditions.

Abstract: Large-scale transformers are central to modern semantic communication, yet
their high computational and communication costs hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. This paper introduces a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging, a novel mechanism that compresses
transformer representations at runtime by selectively merging semantically
redundant tokens under per-layer similarity thresholds. Unlike prior
fixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input
redundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and
task relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies
as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to
obtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and
communication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the
unmodified transformer with 30\% fewer floating-point operations per second and
under 20\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question
answering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model
at less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally,
we show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions
and provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of
model inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile
solution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge
intelligence scenarios.

*Mingxuan Jiang,Yongxin Wang,Ziyue Dai,Yicun Liu,Hongyi Nie,Sen Liu,Hongfeng Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFine is a framework for generating synthetic tabular data by using symbolic "if-then" rules in prompts and filtering strategies to address data scarcity and improve downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular data generation methods struggle with domains that have scarce data, failing to adequately capture data-specific dependencies and leading to poor downstream task performance.

Method: ReFine extracts symbolic "if-then" rules and embeds them into prompts to guide generation. It also uses a dual-granularity filtering strategy to refine rare samples and handle distribution imbalances.

Result: ReFine outperformed existing methods, achieving up to 0.44 improvement in R-squared for regression tasks and 10% improvement in F1 scores for classification.

Conclusion: The ReFine framework demonstrates its capability to generate high-quality synthetic tabular data in data-sparse environments, enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation is increasingly essential in data
management, supporting downstream applications when real-world and high-quality
tabular data is insufficient. Existing tabular generation approaches, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large
Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting
their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While
prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail
to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant
data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these
issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then"
rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly
guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies
a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns
and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional
imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification
benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression
and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning solution utilizing Gradient Boosting Regressor to estimate energy consumption of virtual servers based only on guest resource utilization metrics, achieving high predictive accuracy and variance explained ($0.90 ≤ R² ≤ 0.97$).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of energy estimation in virtualized environments where direct host energy measurement is inaccessible.

Method: The method involves using guest virtual machines' resource utilization metrics to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor for predicting host-side energy consumption measured via RAPL.

Result: Experiments across varying workloads validated the method's predictive accuracy and high variance explained ($0.90 ≤ R² ≤ 0.97$).

Conclusion: Guest-side energy estimation is feasible and supports energy-aware scheduling, cost optimization, and independence from physical host access in virtualized environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to estimate the energy
consumption of virtual servers without access to physical power measurement
interfaces. Using resource utilization metrics collected from guest virtual
machines, we train a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict energy consumption
measured via RAPL on the host. We demonstrate, for the first time, guest-only
resource-based energy estimation without privileged host access with
experiments across diverse workloads, achieving high predictive accuracy and
variance explained ($0.90 \leq R^2 \leq 0.97$), indicating the feasibility of
guest-side energy estimation. This approach can enable energy-aware scheduling,
cost optimization and physical host independent energy estimates in virtualized
environments. Our approach addresses a critical gap in virtualized environments
(e.g. cloud) where direct energy measurement is infeasible.

*Tilen Cadez,Kyoung-Min Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores power-law neural scaling laws in deep regression, confirming consistent scaling behavior across architectures and model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unresolved neural scaling laws in deep regression models and understand their potential for improving performance.

Method: Authors applied various deep learning architectures such as fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers to parameter estimation in twisted van der Waals magnets.

Result: Scaling relationships were observed with losses and dataset size/model capacity; scaling exponents ranged from 1 to 2, depending on the model details and regressed parameters.

Conclusion: Deep regression performance can significantly benefit from increased dataset size due to consistent and identifiable scaling laws.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws--power-law relationships between generalization errors
and characteristics of deep learning models--are vital tools for developing
reliable models while managing limited resources. Although the success of large
language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to
deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically
investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation
model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships
between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a
wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully
connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore,
the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with
specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The
consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the
performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing
data size.

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization) is introduced as a reinforcement learning method for large language models (LLMs) that addresses issues with sequence-level clipping in the context of policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve alignment issues in sequence-level policy optimization caused by the unequal treatment of responses (short vs. long) in traditional clipping methods.

Method: FSPO proposes a Gaussian-motivated clipping adjustment using a KL-corrected drift term and a scaling mechanism proportional to sequence length ($\sqrt{L}$).

Result: The method stabilizes training, balances clip rates across sequence lengths, and achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods on various datasets.

Conclusion: FSPO effectively tackles the length-fairness issue in sequence-level RL methods, improving both training stability and model performance.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which estimates intrinsic dimensions and reconstructs datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust methods of estimating intrinsic dimensions and reconstructing datasets that lie on linear or nonlinear manifolds.

Method: Usage of IDEA, which utilizes a latent space structured by re-weighted double CancelOut layers and a projected reconstruction loss for training.

Result: IDEA demonstrates accurate intrinsic dimension estimation and robust reconstruction on theoretical benchmarks and applied data.

Conclusion: IDEA is an effective tool for intrinsic dimension estimation and reconstruction, validated by theoretical and applied scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA),
which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets
whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating
the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset
after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured
using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the
introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of
the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the
removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of
IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These
experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its
performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The
benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach.
Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution
of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a
pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal
direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the
dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by
working directly within the projection space identified by the network.

To address the time-consuming manual effort required for scholarly discovery,
we present a novel, fully automated system that transitions from data discovery

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of interpreting the internal organization of neural networks in deep learning.

Result: Unsupervised expert routing achieves better reconstruction performance than the supervised baseline, identifying meaningful sub-categorical data structures that transcend human-defined class boundaries.

Conclusion: The study highlights the ability of MoE models to uncover fundamental data structures and offers insights into data quantity and expert specialization trade-offs for designing efficient architectures.

Abstract: Understanding the internal organization of neural networks remains a
fundamental challenge in deep learning interpretability. We address this
challenge by exploring a novel Sparse Mixture of Experts Variational
Autoencoder (SMoE-VAE) architecture. We test our model on the QuickDraw
dataset, comparing unsupervised expert routing against a supervised baseline
guided by ground-truth labels. Surprisingly, we find that unsupervised routing
consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance. The experts learn to
identify meaningful sub-categorical structures that often transcend
human-defined class boundaries. Through t-SNE visualizations and reconstruction
analysis, we investigate how MoE models uncover fundamental data structures
that are more aligned with the model's objective than predefined labels.
Furthermore, our study on the impact of dataset size provides insights into the

### [173] [Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10033)
*Boya Ma,Abram Magner,Maxwell McNeil,Petko Bogdanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-rank coding model for sparse dictionary coding in 2-dictionary scenarios and introduces an efficient optimization method for data reconstruction and imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse dictionary coding, while efficient, faces challenges in achieving accuracy and sparsity when using learned dictionaries, especially in multi-dictionary scenarios where coefficient encoding involves combinations from different dictionaries.

Method: The authors propose a low-rank coding model along with a convex relaxation solution named AODL. This method uses alternating optimization for sparse coding matrices and learned dictionaries, and convergence is mathematically proven.

Result: AODL achieves up to 90% sparser solutions compared to traditional and analytical dictionary baselines while maintaining reconstruction quality. It also successfully handles data reconstruction and missing value imputation.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust and efficient approach to sparse dictionary coding that generalizes well to unseen data, leading to interpretable results and significant sparsity benefits.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few
dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and
multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial
dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete
Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to
efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand,
dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but
require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This
becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding
coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To
address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary
scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the
number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen
samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution,
called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We
then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse
coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent.
We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation
in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality,
AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and
analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries
reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for
training.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks, unifying automata theory with neural architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between symbolic computation in automata theory and deep learning by creating an exact neural simulation of PFAs.

Method: The authors propose an architecture where state distributions are encoded as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation through matrix-vector products, and use gradient-based training to achieve exact PFA behavior.

Result: The neural architecture successfully simulates PFAs and is able to learn their exact behavior when trained on labeled sequence data.

Conclusion: This work unifies probabilistic automata theory with neural network architectures, providing a rigorous framework that combines symbolic computation and deep learning.

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite
automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural
networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and
transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation
via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and
differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without
recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction,
$\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation,
and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We
further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but
learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled
sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This
learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our
results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a
rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and
deep learning.

Conclusion: FedRP offers a robust and efficient solution for privacy preservation and communication cost reduction in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers an innovative paradigm for collaborative model
training across decentralized devices, such as smartphones, balancing enhanced
predictive performance with the protection of user privacy in sensitive areas
like Internet of Things (IoT) and medical data analysis. Despite its
advantages, FL encounters significant challenges related to user privacy
protection against potential attacks and the management of communication costs.
This paper introduces a novel federated learning algorithm called FedRP, which
integrates random projection techniques with the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. This approach enhances privacy by
employing random projection to reduce the dimensionality of model parameters
prior to their transmission to a central server, reducing the communication
cost. The proposed algorithm offers a strong $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential
privacy guarantee, demonstrating resilience against data reconstruction
attacks. Experimental results reveal that FedRP not only maintains high model
accuracy but also outperforms existing methods, including conventional
differential privacy approaches and FedADMM, in terms of both privacy
preservation and communication efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VBLL's integration with TabPFN for uncertainty estimation in tabular datasets and finds that the original TabPFN performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the efficacy of employing VBLL for improved uncertainty calibration of TabPFN in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis.

Method: The authors conducted experiments on three medical tabular datasets to compare the uncertainty calibration performance of the original TabPFN and TabPFN integrated with VBLL.

Result: Contrary to expectations, the original TabPFN consistently outperformed the VBLL-integrated version in uncertainty estimation across all datasets.

Conclusion: VBLL integration does not enhance, but rather underperforms compared to the original TabPFN in terms of uncertainty calibration for tabular datasets.

Abstract: Predictive models are being increasingly used across a wide range of domains,
including safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and criminal
justice. Reliable uncertainty estimation is a crucial task in such settings.
Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a recently proposed machine

transformer architecture. Variational Bayesian Last Layers (VBLL) is a
state-of-the-art lightweight variational formulation that effectively improves
uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead. In this work we aim
to evaluate the performance of VBLL integrated with the recently proposed
TabPFN in uncertainty calibration. Our experiments, conducted on three
benchmark medical tabular datasets, compare the performance of the original
TabPFN and the VBLL-integrated version. Contrary to expectations, we observed
that original TabPFN consistently outperforms VBLL integrated TabPFN in
uncertainty calibration across all datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance symbolic regression by overcoming limitations of genetic programming and enabling precise equation recovery and modeling of dynamic systems.

Method: KAN-SR employs Kolmogorov Arnold Networks, combined with deep learning, simplification strategies like translational symmetries, and separabilities.

Result: Successfully recovers ground-truth equations from the Feynman SRSD dataset and accurately models dynamics in an in-silico bioprocess system.

Conclusion: The approach expands the potential of symbolic regression in scientific discovery and dynamic engineering system modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a novel symbolic regression framework, namely KAN-SR, built on
Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) which follows a divide-and-conquer approach.
Symbolic regression searches for mathematical equations that best fit a given
dataset and is commonly solved with genetic programming approaches. We show
that by using deep learning techniques, more specific KANs, and combining them
with simplification strategies such as translational symmetries and
separabilities, we are able to recover ground-truth equations of the Feynman
Symbolic Regression for Scientific Discovery (SRSD) dataset. Additionally, we
show that by combining the proposed framework with neural controlled

bioprocess system precisely, opening the door for the dynamic modeling of other
engineering systems.

*Nour Jamoussi,Giuseppe Serra,Photios A. Stavrou,Marios Kountouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-geometric projection approach for personalization in Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL), enabling a trade-off between global generalization and local specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address data heterogeneity and privacy concerns in decentralized learning while maintaining personalized and reliable models.

Method: An information-geometric projection framework is proposed to tune trade-offs between global and local performance efficiently and cost-free, implemented using a variational approach with the IVON optimizer.

Result: Empirical tests show the proposed method effectively balances global and local performance under heterogeneous data with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The method facilitates efficient personalization in BFL while maintaining computational efficiency and adaptability to heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with
decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable
models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches
typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational
inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to
local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric
projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the
global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables
a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization.
Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to
computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive
closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the
proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved
Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to
general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous
data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and
local performance with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BenchECG, a standardized benchmark for evaluating ECG models on diverse datasets and tasks, and proposes xECG, a self-supervised learning model that outperforms existing ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inconsistencies in evaluating foundation models for ECG datasets and tasks, providing a standardized framework to enable fair comparison.

Method: The authors developed BenchECG, a benchmark suite, and xECG, a recurrent model using self-supervised learning (SimDINOv2).

Result: BenchECG allows rigorous evaluation across diverse tasks, and xECG achieves top performance across all datasets, setting a new standard among models.

Conclusion: BenchECG and xECG standardize comparison for ECG foundation models and establish new baselines, paving the way for accelerated progress in the field.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely used, and well-suited to
deep learning. Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for
ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However,
consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task
selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we
introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite
of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG,
an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning,
which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available
state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available
model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising
evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate
progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance
over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation
models.

*Francisco Javier Esono Nkulu Andong,Qi Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework for efficient and privacy-preserving resource management in 6G edge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical resource management challenges in ultra-dense, intelligent 6G edge environments, particularly under constraints of privacy, mobility, and energy.

Method: A novel Fed-MARL framework is introduced, leveraging Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) and a secure aggregation protocol for decentralized and privacy-preserving resource management.

Result: The framework significantly improves task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness while ensuring privacy and scalability in resource-constrained 6G environments.

Conclusion: Fed-MARL proves effective for achieving energy-efficient, real-time resource management while meeting 6G-specific service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC.

Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge
environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility,
and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel
Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that
incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application
layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource
management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum
access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue
length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a
secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key
exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to
semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a
partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a
multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy
efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific
service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results
demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines
in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring
robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G
edge networks.

### [181] [A Symmetry-Integrated Approach to Surface Code Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10164)
*Hoshitaro Ohnishi,Hideo Mukai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reoptimization technique for quantum error correction decoders using neural networks to improve decoding accuracy, showing universal effectiveness across different architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the issue in quantum error correction where decoders provide ambiguous predictions due to non-uniqueness in input-output mapping.

Method: The authors re-framed surface code decoding as a regression problem and introduced a technique to approximate syndrome measurements with continuous functions using neural networks.

Result: The study demonstrated improved decoding accuracy for various network architectures and code distances, proving the effectiveness of the reoptimization technique.

Conclusion: The proposed reoptimization approach enhances the decoding process universally across network architectures and code distances, making it a promising tool for practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum error correction, which utilizes logical qubits that are encoded as
redundant multiple physical qubits to find and correct errors in physical
qubits, is indispensable for practical quantum computing. Surface code is
considered to be a promising encoding method with a high error threshold that
is defined by stabilizer generators. However, previous methods have suffered
from the problem that the decoder acquires solely the error probability
distribution because of the non-uniqueness of correct prediction obtained from
the input. To circumvent this problem, we propose a technique to reoptimize the
decoder model by approximating syndrome measurements with a continuous function
that is mathematically interpolated by neural network. We evaluated the
improvement in accuracy of a multilayer perceptron based decoder for code
distances of 5 and 7 as well as for decoders based on convolutional and
recurrent neural networks and transformers for a code distance of 5. In all
cases, the reoptimized decoder gave better accuracy than the original models,
demonstrating the universal effectiveness of the proposed method that is
independent of code distance or network architecture. These results suggest
that re-framing the problem of surface code decoding into a regression problem
that can be tackled by deep learning is a useful strategy.

### [182] [The Hidden Width of Deep ResNets: Tight Error Bounds and Phase Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10167)
*Lénaïc Chizat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates gradient-based training dynamics of deep ResNets, showing convergence to a Neural Mean ODE. It identifies scaling regimes for feature learning and derives tight error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding training dynamics of deep architectures like ResNets and their resemblance to continuous mean-field dynamics is crucial for optimization and scalability in machine learning.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis and empirical validation to explore scaling laws of ResNets, leveraging novel stochastic approximations and propagation of chaos to model training behavior.

Result: The study reveals error bounds between ResNet outputs and limits as depth increases and highlights regimes for feature learning versus lazy training dynamics, supported both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: The convergence to Neural Mean ODE dynamics suggests practical principles for scaling and optimizing deep network architectures like ResNets, offering insights into feature learning versus linear parameterizations.

Abstract: We study the gradient-based training of large-depth residual networks
(ResNets) from standard random initializations. We show that with a diverging
depth $L$, a fixed embedding dimension $D$, and an arbitrary hidden width $M$,
the training dynamics converges to a Neural Mean ODE training dynamics.
Remarkably, the limit is independent of the scaling of $M$, covering practical
cases of, say, Transformers, where $M$ (the number of hidden units or attention
heads per layer) is typically of the order of $D$. For a residual scale
$\Theta_D\big(\frac{\alpha}{LM}\big)$, we obtain the error bound
$O_D\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the model's output
and its limit after a fixed number gradient of steps, and we verify empirically
that this rate is tight. When $\alpha=\Theta(1)$, the limit exhibits complete
feature learning, i.e. the Mean ODE is genuinely non-linearly parameterized. In
contrast, we show that $\alpha \to \infty$ yields a \lazy ODE regime where the
Mean ODE is linearly parameterized. We then focus on the particular case of
ResNets with two-layer perceptron blocks, for which we study how these scalings
depend on the embedding dimension $D$. We show that for this model, the only
residual scale that leads to complete feature learning is
$\Theta\big(\frac{\sqrt{D}}{LM}\big)$. In this regime, we prove the error bound
$O\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\sqrt{D}}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the ResNet and its
limit after a fixed number of gradient steps, which is also empirically tight.
Our convergence results rely on a novel mathematical perspective on ResNets :
(i) due to the randomness of the initialization, the forward and backward pass
through the ResNet behave as the stochastic approximation of certain mean ODEs,
and (ii) by propagation of chaos (that is, asymptotic independence of the
units) this behavior is preserved through the training dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrated robustness, scalability, and versatility for deterministic and probabilistic 3D physics simulation tasks, suggesting significant potential for high-performance large-scale simulations.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for learning deterministic and probabilistic
neural surrogates for high-resolution 3D physics simulations. We introduce a
hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone architecture targeted for 3D physics
simulations, which significantly outperforms existing architectures in terms of
speed and accuracy. Our proposed network can be pretrained on small patches of
the simulation domain, which can be fused to obtain a global solution,
optionally guided via a fast and scalable sequence-to-sequence model to include
long-range dependencies. This setup allows for training large-scale models with
reduced memory and compute requirements for high-resolution datasets. We
evaluate our backbone architecture against a large set of baseline methods with
the objective to simultaneously learn the dynamics of 14 different types of
PDEs in 3D. We demonstrate how to scale our model to high-resolution isotropic
turbulence with spatial resolutions of up to $512^3$. Finally, we demonstrate
the versatility of our network by training it as a diffusion model to produce
probabilistic samples of highly turbulent 3D channel flows across varying
Reynolds numbers, accurately capturing the underlying flow statistics.

*Zexu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel ensemble learning framework that optimizes margin variance and computational efficiency, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current margin-based ensemble techniques often ignore margin variance, limiting their generalization and increasing vulnerability to overfitting, especially in noisy or imbalanced datasets. Computational inefficiencies in optimizing ensemble weights further complicate their scalability to large-scale problems.

Method: A novel framework that incorporates margin variance into the loss function, jointly optimizing the negative expected margin and its variance. Ensemble weights are reparameterized onto the unit sphere for computational simplicity.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method outperforms conventional margin-based ensemble approaches, proving better robustness and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly addresses the limitations of conventional ensemble methods by increasing robustness, generalization, and efficiency, showcasing practical implications for real-world datasets.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has been widely recognized as a pivotal technique for
boosting predictive performance by combining multiple base models.
Nevertheless, conventional margin-based ensemble methods predominantly focus on
maximizing the expected margin while neglecting the critical role of margin
variance, which inherently restricts the generalization capability of the model
and heightens its vulnerability to overfitting, particularly in noisy or
imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the conventional approach of optimizing
ensemble weights within the probability simplex often introduces computational
inefficiency and scalability challenges, complicating its application to
large-scale problems. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces a
novel ensemble learning framework that explicitly incorporates margin variance
into the loss function. Our method jointly optimizes the negative expected
margin and its variance, leading to enhanced robustness and improved
generalization performance. Moreover, by reparameterizing the ensemble weights
onto the unit sphere, we substantially simplify the optimization process and
improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently
outperforms traditional margin-based ensemble techniques, underscoring its
effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: Traditional fatigue life prediction for aircraft requires complex workflows and is resource-intensive; this paper proposes a machine learning-based pipeline validated to provide accurate and faster estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in aerospace requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent failures. Traditional fatigue prediction methods are reliable but time-consuming and resource-heavy, warranting exploration of faster, efficient alternatives.

Method: A machine learning-based pipeline is designed to predict fatigue life across different aircraft wing locations using operational flight parameters. The approach involves accurate statistical validation and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The pipeline produces accurate fatigue life predictions and demonstrates effective validation in a realistic use case, supporting its viability as a complement to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ML-based fatigue life prediction can augment traditional approaches, reducing simulation costs and necessary resources while maintaining reliability in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational
phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry
requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures.
Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety.
Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve
complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element
Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying
cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps
often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the
computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions.
Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life
estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing
quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the
fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters
of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its
operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue
life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical
validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a
complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly
simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the rising usage of LLMs in peer-review and assess the risk and impact of prompt injection manipulations.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 1k ICLR 2024 paper reviews generated by various LLMs, focusing on effects of prompt injections and acceptance bias.

Result: Demonstrated high prompt injection effectiveness (up to 100% acceptance scores) and inherent acceptance bias (>95% in many models).

Conclusion: Prompt injections pose a serious vulnerability, and LLMs exhibit acceptance bias, both significantly affecting discussions on their role in peer-review.

Abstract: The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific
peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using
hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of
such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would
have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the
practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our
systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide
range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are
indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews
are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have
great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

*Sahil Sethi,Kai Sundmacher,Caroline Ganzer*

TL;DR: This study introduces a data-driven transfer learning framework to predict key properties of ionic liquids using limited experimental data, leveraging pre-trained models and simple neural networks for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of predicting thermophysical properties of ionic liquids (ILs) efficiently due to the vast chemical design space and scarcity of experimental data.

Method: A two-stage transfer learning framework: (1) Pre-training neural recommender systems (NRS) on COSMO-RS simulated data for structural embeddings, and (2) Fine-tuning feedforward neural networks with experimental data to predict five IL properties.

Result: The approach improved prediction accuracy for four out of five IL properties, demonstrated strong extrapolation to unseen ILs, and enabled scalable property predictions for over 700,000 IL combinations.

Conclusion: The study validates that combining simulated data and transfer learning bridges the gap caused by sparse experimental data, providing a scalable and reliable solution for IL property prediction critical for process design.

Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional
solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to
various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical
properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the
limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a
data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender
system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse
experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first,
pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature
and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and
anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these
embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In
this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity,
surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both
within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained
models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models
for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial
margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously
unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for
over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in
process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated
data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning regressors in an SDN-enabled architecture for generating randomized values as nonce candidates for blockchain-secured energy trading during disasters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for secure and traceable energy trading between solar-powered households and mobile charging units in disaster scenarios where conventional energy infrastructure is compromised.

Method: The paper utilizes a 9000-sample dataset to test the randomness of AutoML-selected regression models, and establishes an SDN-enabled system for flexible energy routing and secure blockchain transactions.

Result: Random Forest and Extra Trees exhibited the highest randomness, while Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and LightGBM produced slightly lower randomness scores of 97.6%, 98.8%, and 99.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: Tree-based ensemble models show potential as effective, lightweight nonce generators for blockchain-secured networks in disaster-resilient energy trading architectures.

Abstract: In disaster scenarios where conventional energy infrastructure is
compromised, secure and traceable energy trading between solar-powered
households and mobile charging units becomes a necessity. To ensure the
integrity of such transactions over a blockchain network, robust and
unpredictable nonce generation is vital. This study proposes an SDN-enabled
architecture where machine learning regressors are leveraged not for their
accuracy, but for their potential to generate randomized values suitable as
nonce candidates. Therefore, it is newly called Proof of AutoML. Here, SDN
allows flexible control over data flows and energy routing policies even in
fragmented or degraded networks, ensuring adaptive response during emergencies.
Using a 9000-sample dataset, we evaluate five AutoML-selected regression models
- Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and K-Nearest
Neighbors - not by their prediction accuracy, but by their ability to produce
diverse and non-deterministic outputs across shuffled data inputs. Randomness
analysis reveals that Random Forest and Extra Trees regressors exhibit complete
dependency on randomness, whereas Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors and
LightGBM show strong but slightly lower randomness scores (97.6%, 98.8% and
99.9%, respectively). These findings highlight that certain machine learning
models, particularly tree-based ensembles, may serve as effective and
lightweight nonce generators within blockchain-secured, SDN-based energy
trading infrastructures resilient to disaster conditions.

*Jesse van Remmerden,Zaharah Bukhsh,Yingqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose CDQAC, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm for addressing limitations in job-shop scheduling by learning from historical data, showing superior performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address limitations of online RL methods for job-shop scheduling, such as the need for millions of simulated interactions and low sample efficiency due to random policy initialization.

Method: The method involves introducing CDQAC, an offline RL algorithm that uses a quantile-based critic and delayed policy update. It learns directly from historical data to estimate return distributions for scheduling problems.

Result: CDQAC outperforms state-of-the-art offline and online RL methods, surpasses data-generating heuristics, and learns high-quality policies using limited historical training data (10-20 instances).

Conclusion: The research concludes that offline RL using CDQAC is a highly effective and sample-efficient approach to job-shop scheduling, even excelling with suboptimal training data.

Abstract: The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with
wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many
online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn
constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL
methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may
not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization
leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce
Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL
algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical
data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining
the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a
quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return
distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs
outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to
learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original
data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL
baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20
training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that
CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than
when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority
dispatching rules.

Result: Applied the framework to cyclone-impacted Khurushkul, Bangladesh, and mudslide-affected Freetown, Sierra Leone, showcasing post-disaster physical vulnerability transitions.

Conclusion: The study provides tools for understanding regional vulnerability dynamics, aiding post-disaster risk mitigation and sustainable development strategies.

Abstract: In the aftermath of disasters, many institutions worldwide face challenges in
continually monitoring changes in disaster risk, limiting the ability of key
decision-makers to assess progress towards the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015-2030. While numerous efforts have substantially advanced
the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and
data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally
important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability.
To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational
Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for
modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph
representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series
satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a
weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in
the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two
disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the
cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the
mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals
post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable
insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for
post-disaster risk reduction.

*Myung Jin Kim,YeongHyeon Park,Il Dong Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a convolutional module inspired by ARIMA for efficient and accurate long-term time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional ARIMA in iterative multi-step forecasting and its lack of adaptability to multivariate datasets.

Method: The method utilizes a convolutional block with components covering trend (autoregression) and local variations (moving average) for direct, multi-step prediction.

Result: Experimental evaluation on nine benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive accuracy and effective handling of strong trend variations.

Conclusion: ARMA is an architecturally simple yet effective tool, with potential applications beyond its core forecasting function, such as substituting positional embeddings in sequential models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple yet effective convolutional module for long-term
time series forecasting. The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional
components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for
refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which
requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs
multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings.
Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method
ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong
trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore,
analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional
information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for
positional embeddings in sequential models.

*Benjamin David Shaffer,Brooks Kinch,Joseph Klobusicky,M. Ani Hsieh,Nathaniel Trask*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework for real-time adaptive source localization using a physics-informed digital twin that integrates finite element guarantees with transformer-based operator learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a real-time system for accurately localizing sources in coupled hydrodynamic-transport problems, leveraging physics-informed methods to ensure consistency and stability in complex environments.

Method: The framework uses conditional neural Whitney forms (CNWF) combined with finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) and transformer-based operator learning. A staggered scheme alternates between digital twin evaluation and sensor placement guided by Lloyd's algorithm.

Result: The proposed model preserves physical constraints, achieves improved source localization in complex geometries compared to physics-agnostic models, and supports stability and consistency through reduced-order modeling.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-aware constraints in neural network architectures enhances accuracy and effectiveness in environmental modeling tasks, demonstrating the benefits of structure-preserving methods for real-time localization.

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in
which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled
hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data
assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms
(CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus
(FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves
discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It
employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form
basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible
with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model
retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation,
yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the
source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating
the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with
analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage
functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within
an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under
continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient
condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic
transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when
physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation
provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.

### [193] [A Discrepancy-Based Perspective on Dataset Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10367)
*Tong Chen,Raghavendra Selvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for dataset condensation (DC), constructing smaller synthetic datasets that capture key characteristics of large datasets while supporting broader objectives like robustness and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to compress large datasets into smaller synthetic ones that still provide comparable or improved model performance, and address issues like robustness, privacy, and generalization.

Method: The authors propose using discrepancy measures to formalize DC, connecting it to the data distribution approximation problem and extending its definition to include diverse goals beyond generalization.

Result: The framework integrates existing DC methods while expanding their scope to a broader range of objectives such as robustness and privacy.

Conclusion: The paper provides a generalizable and formal approach to DC, establishing it as a versatile tool for creating efficient synthetic datasets that align with various machine learning goals.

Abstract: Given a dataset of finitely many elements $\mathcal{T} = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i
= 1}^N$, the goal of dataset condensation (DC) is to construct a synthetic
dataset $\mathcal{S} = \{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_j\}_{j = 1}^M$ which is
significantly smaller ($M \ll N$) such that a model trained from scratch on
$\mathcal{S}$ achieves comparable or even superior generalization performance
to a model trained on $\mathcal{T}$. Recent advances in DC reveal a close
connection to the problem of approximating the data distribution represented by
$\mathcal{T}$ with a reduced set of points. In this work, we present a unified
framework that encompasses existing DC methods and extend the task-specific
notion of DC to a more general and formal definition using notions of
discrepancy, which quantify the distance between probability distribution in
different regimes. Our framework broadens the objective of DC beyond
generalization, accommodating additional objectives such as robustness,
privacy, and other desirable properties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAPE, a foundation model pretraining on large global ECG cohorts, and finds that cohort diversity improves in-distribution accuracy but hampers out-of-distribution generalization, proposing the IDB strategy as a solution for clinical fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of how cohort composition in contrastive learning affects downstream clinical prediction tasks and to improve clinical fairness and generalization.

Method: The authors pretrain the CAPE model using ECG data from diverse global cohorts and evaluate how demographics and diversity impact performance. They introduce the IDB strategy to counter cohort-specific artifacts and enhance OOD generalization.

Result: Pretraining on diverse cohorts boosts in-distribution accuracy but decreases out-of-distribution generalization due to cohort-specific artifacts. The proposed IDB strategy mitigates this issue and enhances robustness.

Conclusion: Cohort composition in contrastive learning significantly impacts clinical prediction outcomes, with the IDB strategy offering a path toward fair and generalizable models.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining
strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We
present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation
model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations
across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically
assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity
influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two
additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream
performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort,
including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a
multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy,
it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach
by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the
In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency
during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important
insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.

*Quan Nguyen,Adji Bousso Dieng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vendi Information Gain (VIG), an active learning policy to improve species identification from camera trap images. VIG focuses on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty and achieves high accuracy using limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying species from camera trap images presents a challenge due to limited labeling resources. Active learning can optimize labeling efforts but often neglects dataset-wide uncertainty.

Method: The paper proposes Vendi Information Gain (VIG), an active learning method that prioritizes data selection based on their impact on reducing prediction uncertainty across the entire dataset.

Result: Using the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG achieves near full supervision-level accuracy with less than 10% labeled data and consistently outperforms standard active learning baselines.

Conclusion: VIG is an effective and resource-efficient approach for improving species identification in biodiversity monitoring, with potential applications extending beyond ecology.

Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important
endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image
data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active
learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data
to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but
typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without
considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active
learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on
their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both
informativeness and diversity. Applied to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG
achieves impressive predictive accuracy close to full supervision using less
than 10% of the labels. It consistently outperforms standard baselines across
metrics and batch sizes, collecting more diverse data in the feature space. VIG
has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for
biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGPO, a reinforcement learning framework tailored for masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs), leveraging their inpainting ability to enhance exploration and sample efficiency. IGPO achieves state-of-the-art results across mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for large language models suffer from inefficiencies due to sparse reward signals and exploration failures. Diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), with their unique inpainting capabilities, offer a potential solution for guiding exploration.

Method: The paper presents IGPO (Inpainting Guided Policy Optimization), a framework utilizing dLLMs' inpainting ability to strategically insert reasoning traces during exploration. This approach bridges supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to optimize trajectory spaces.

Result: IGPO improves sample efficiency and restores meaningful gradients in group-based optimization methods like GRPO. The approach outperforms previous methods on GSM8K, Math500, and AMC benchmarks, showcasing substantial gains.

Conclusion: IGPO leverages the unique properties of dLLMs to overcome exploration challenges in RL, demonstrating its efficacy through improved performance and sample efficiency. It establishes new benchmarks for mathematical reasoning in masked diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising
alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while
supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how
inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with
reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals
and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this
inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their
inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided
Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial
ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full
solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces
while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such
as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO
restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also
propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that
better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques
including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains
across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new
state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.

*Rupert Mitchell,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuSe offers an efficient approximation of softmax attention using semantic clustering and multipole expansions to reduce computational complexity in transformers, while preserving rich information and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the quadratic computational complexity problem of transformer models when dealing with long context lengths.

Method: The authors introduce Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), which uses separate clustering of queries and keys in their learned spaces, combined with multipole expansions to build a hierarchical two-stage attention mechanism. Centroid-based approximations with dipole corrections are employed to capture richer information.

Result: MuSe achieves a $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash Attention for isolated attention layers at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For a pretraining setup with book-length texts, runtime is reduced by 12.2% with only a 0.36% loss degradation.

Conclusion: Multipole approximations effectively reduce computational complexity in transformers without significant loss in accuracy, making them viable for efficient transformer pretraining and deployment.

Abstract: We present Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), an efficient approximation of
softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions
from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational
complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys
separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical
two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group
only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that
respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment
centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture
directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during
training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention,
requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural
modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal
attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention.
On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash
Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For
causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines
exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end
pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we
achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing
the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer
pretraining.

*Francesco Vitale,Tommaso Zoppi,Francesco Flammini,Nicola Mazzocca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates using process mining for real-time anomaly detection in ERTMS/ETCS L2 systems to enhance resilience, focusing on both detection and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies in railway systems can occur despite rigorous software validation, due to design-time unknown conditions and emergent cyber-threats.

Method: The approach combines process mining for understanding system control flow with unsupervised machine learning for anomaly detection and localization in run-time scenarios.

Result: The methodology successfully identifies anomalies and links them to critical system components with high accuracy and efficiency in the RBC/RBC Handover scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances railway system resilience by integrating monitoring and anomaly localization, offering explainability and practical applicability.

Abstract: Ensuring the resilience of computer-based railways is increasingly crucial to
account for uncertainties and changes due to the growing complexity and
criticality of those systems. Although their software relies on strict
verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices
and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to
residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at
design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores
run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the
resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European
Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual
control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time
monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly
localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link
relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a
reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its
capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and
explainability.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) for solving highly complex combinatorial optimization problems. It focuses on creating an instance-driven heuristic approach guided by LLMs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill the gap in leveraging structural properties of individual problem instances within metaheuristic approaches, addressing the limitations of current methods that primarily focus on code generation by LLMs.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs with BRKGA by using instance-specific metrics co-designed by humans and LLMs. These metrics guide the LLM to generate tailored heuristic biases for steering the algorithm's search space.

Result: Across 1,050 problem instances, the proposed hybrid (BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick) demonstrated statistically significant improvements over standard BRKGA, especially in solving the most complex cases.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs for generating instance-driven heuristic bias is a promising approach for enhancing metaheuristics, showing meaningful improvements in complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within metaheuristics opens a novel
path for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. While most
existing approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine
specific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of
individual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the
NP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the
instance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM
collaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally
efficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate
a tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the
search space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including
rigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted
ablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across
1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our
top-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically
significant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex
instances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori,
instance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing
metaheuristics in complex optimization domains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically-compatible shortest-path computation algorithm based on spike-timing, avoiding global state or gradient updates required by traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph algorithms and reinforcement learning methods are computationally inefficient and biologically implausible for modeling rapid behavioral adaptation in natural systems.

Method: The authors develop a spike-based message-passing algorithm exploiting spike-timing coincidences and temporal compression for local computation of shortest paths.

Result: Analytical proofs and simulations demonstrated convergence and discovery of all shortest paths within random spatial networks using purely timing-based mechanisms.

Conclusion: The work illustrates how biological networks can leverage local computation and spike-time prediction for solving complex problems, informing fields like AI, computational neuroscience, and neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Efficient planning and sequence selection are central to intelligence, yet
current approaches remain largely incompatible with biological computation.
Classical graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* require global state and
biologically implausible operations such as backtracing, while reinforcement
learning methods rely on slow gradient-based policy updates that appear
inconsistent with rapid behavioral adaptation observed in natural systems.
  We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation
that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic
processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify
nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message
pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal
compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical
proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the
algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based
mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute
shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks
might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and
relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for
understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems,
with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement
learning, and neuromorphic systems.

TL;DR: eHashPipe is a lightweight, efficient kernel-based resource observability system leveraging eBPF and HashPipe to monitor CPU and memory usage with high precision at low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient and precise system-level resource monitoring solution addressing the shortcomings of traditional userspace polling tools, such as high latency and context-switch overhead.

Method: The paper introduces eHashPipe, a real-time observability system that utilizes eBPF and the HashPipe sketching algorithm. It implements in-kernel pipelines for CPU and memory tracking using two modes: Top-k monitoring (for most resource-demanding processes) and specific PID tracking. 

Result: eHashPipe achieved 100% precision for Top-k monitoring at k = 1, 5, and 10, and over 90% at k = 20 and 30. It also effectively captured short-lived bursts with significantly finer temporal resolution than traditional tools like 'top,' all while maintaining low overhead.

Conclusion: eHashPipe offers a precise, responsive, and low-overhead resource monitoring solution, particularly suited for latency-sensitive environments such as cloud and edge systems.

Abstract: System-level resource monitoring with both precision and efficiency is a
continuous challenge. We introduce eHashPipe, a lightweight, real-time resource
observability system utilizing eBPF and the HashPipe sketching algorithm.
eHashPipe supports two tracking modes: Top-k monitoring to identify the most
resource-demanding processes and specific PID tracking to detail the behavior
of selected processes. We implement two in-kernel eBPF pipelines for on-CPU
time and memory usage. Unlike traditional userspace polling tools, eHashPipe
operates in the kernel to reduce latency and context-switch overhead while
keeping the runtime footprint small. During our experiments, eHashPipe attains
100 percent Top-k precision for CPU and memory at k = 1, 5, and 10, 95.0/90.0
percent at k = 20, and 93.3/83.3 percent at k = 30 compared to the ground
truth. It exposes short-lived bursts with about 14 times finer temporal
resolution than top while imposing very low overhead. These results show that
eHashPipe delivers accurate, responsive insight with minimal impact, making it
well suited for latency-sensitive cloud and edge environments.

TL;DR: MimicDroid enables humanoid robots to learn manipulation tasks from human play videos using in-context learning, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots lack scalable solutions to learn diverse manipulation tasks efficiently from minimal examples.

Method: MimicDroid trains policies using human play videos by extracting trajectory pairs of similar behaviors and retargeting human wrist poses to humanoids.

Result: MimicDroid demonstrated higher success rates in real-world scenarios and stronger generalization in novel environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Human play videos combined with in-context learning can make humanoid robots adaptable, scalable, and efficient for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We aim to enable humanoid robots to efficiently solve new manipulation tasks
from a few video examples. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework
for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid
adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated
data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play
videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their
environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce
MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as
the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar
manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one
trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired
ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time.
To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses
estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It
also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to
human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate
few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation
benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid
outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher
success rates in the real world. Additional materials can be found on:

TL;DR: MIMo v2 is a developmental robot model representing infants' sensorimotor changes from birth to 24 months, offering enhanced realism through features like growing body, foveated vision, sensorimotor delays, inverse kinematics, and compatibility improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current developmental robots and simulation tools lack the ability to emulate changes in an infant's physical and sensory-motor development over time.

Method: Introduced MIMo v2, a multimodal infant model with growing physical attributes, evolving sensory-motor abilities, and complementary tools for enhanced simulation realism.

Result: The features of MIMo v2 include dynamic body growth, developing visual acuity, sensorimotor delay modeling, inverse kinematics, and better system integration for simulation studies.

Conclusion: MIMo v2 provides enriched realism in sensorimotor development simulations, addressing previous limitations of static infant models and aiding in developmental studies through its open-access platform.

Abstract: Infancy is characterized by rapid body growth and an explosive change of
sensory and motor abilities. However, developmental robots and simulation
platforms are typically designed in the image of a specific age, which limits
their ability to capture the changing abilities and constraints of developing
infants. To address this issue, we present MIMo v2, a new version of the
multimodal infant model. It includes a growing body with increasing actuation
strength covering the age range from birth to 24 months. It also features
foveated vision with developing visual acuity as well as sensorimotor delays
modeling finite signal transmission speeds to and from an infant's brain.
Further enhancements of this MIMo version include an inverse kinematics module,
a random environment generator and updated compatiblity with third-party
simulation and learning libraries. Overall, this new MIMo version permits
increased realism when modeling various aspects of sensorimotor development.

TL;DR: The paper explores the ability of the Pepper robot to communicate in Italian Sign Language (LIS), finding it can perform some signs intelligibly, though improvement is needed for full sentences and nuanced expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create inclusivity in human-robot interactions by enabling robots to communicate effectively with Deaf users through Italian Sign Language (LIS).

Method: The researchers co-designed and implemented 52 LIS signs on the Pepper robot using manual animations and an inverse kinematics solver. They then conducted a user study with 12 LIS-proficient participants who evaluated the robot's sign intelligibility through tasks and questionnaires.

Result: The study found that single LIS signs were mostly recognized correctly, but full sentence recognition was poor due to the robot's limited articulation and timing issues.

Conclusion: Commercial robots like Pepper can perform certain LIS signs, offering potential for inclusive design. However, further development, including multi-modal enhancements and participatory design, is required for better robot expressivity and usability for Deaf users.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly experimented in public and assistive settings,
but their accessibility for Deaf users remains quite underexplored. Italian
Sign Language (LIS) is a fully-fledged natural language that relies on complex
manual and non-manual components. Enabling robots to communicate using LIS
could foster more inclusive human robot interaction, especially in social
environments such as hospitals, airports, or educational settings. This study
investigates whether a commercial social robot, Pepper, can produce
intelligible LIS signs and short signed LIS sentences. With the help of a Deaf
student and his interpreter, an expert in LIS, we co-designed and implemented
52 LIS signs on Pepper using either manual animation techniques or a MATLAB
based inverse kinematics solver. We conducted a exploratory user study
involving 12 participants proficient in LIS, both Deaf and hearing.
Participants completed a questionnaire featuring 15 single-choice video-based
sign recognition tasks and 2 open-ended questions on short signed sentences.
Results shows that the majority of isolated signs were recognized correctly,
although full sentence recognition was significantly lower due to Pepper's
limited articulation and temporal constraints. Our findings demonstrate that
even commercially available social robots like Pepper can perform a subset of
LIS signs intelligibly, offering some opportunities for a more inclusive
interaction design. Future developments should address multi-modal enhancements
(e.g., screen-based support or expressive avatars) and involve Deaf users in
participatory design to refine robot expressivity and usability.

### [205] [Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893)
*Hanbit Oh,Masaki Murooka,Tomohiro Motoda,Ryoichi Nakajo,Yukiyasu Domae*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework, SART, which allows robots to learn from a single human demonstration and autonomously augment their data safely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imitation learning methods require significant human effort or risk collisions in robot exploration, creating inefficiencies and safety concerns.

Method: SART operates in two stages: (1) a single human demonstration with precision data annotated and (2) autonomous, safe robot trajectory generation based on these boundaries.

Result: Experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks show SART leads to higher success rates compared to traditional methods relying purely on human demonstrations.

Conclusion: SART reduces human effort required for data collection, ensures safety in robot learning, and improves policy performance in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents;
however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition --
via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable
performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety
guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in
clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual
environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes
Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy
learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset
through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human
teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision
boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,
followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot
generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and
reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data
collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.
Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that
SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely
on human-collected demonstrations. Video results available at

### [206] [Detection of Anomalous Behavior in Robot Systems Based on Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09953)
*Mahfuzul I. Nissan,Sharmin Aktar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study proposes a machine learning-based system for anomaly detection in robotic systems, comparing different models for two robotic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems by addressing potential safety risks through anomaly detection.

Method: Collected logs from robotic simulations (CoppeliaSim) in two contexts and evaluated machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Autoencoder.

Result: Logistic Regression excelled in one context (quadcopter), while the Autoencoder was most effective in another (Pioneer robot), indicating context dependency.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of context in model selection and highlights the effectiveness of autoencoders for complex anomaly detection in robotic systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to
prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous
design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience
malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine
learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the
safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct
scenarios using CoppeliaSim and comparatively evaluated several machine
learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in a quadcopter context
(Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while
LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved
to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model
choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies
across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a
comparative approach and demonstrates the particular strengths of autoencoders
for detecting complex anomalies in robotic systems.

### [208] [Towards simulation-based optimization of compliant fingers for high-speed connector assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10012)
*Richard Matthias Hartisch,Alexander Rother,Jörg Krüger,Kevin Haninger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simulation-based design tool for optimizing compliant mechanisms to achieve better performance and robustness in dynamic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional design methods for soft robotic structures, which rely on time-consuming hardware iteration or simplified models that fail to capture complex task dynamics.

Method: The authors use advanced dynamic simulation tools to design compliant fingers based on task-level objectives such as success rates, optimizing parameters like stiffness for specific tasks.

Result: The optimized design increased the tolerable variation range for insertion tasks by a factor of 2.29 and successfully reduced failure cases in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The trends in stiffness requirements vary across different tasks, emphasizing the importance of task-specific design tools to address unique geometries and dynamic behaviors in soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Mechanical compliance is a key design parameter for dynamic contact-rich
manipulation, affecting task success and safety robustness over contact
geometry variation. Design of soft robotic structures, such as compliant
fingers, requires choosing design parameters which affect geometry and
stiffness, and therefore manipulation performance and robustness. Today, these
parameters are chosen through either hardware iteration, which takes
significant development time, or simplified models (e.g. planar), which can't
address complex manipulation task objectives. Improvements in dynamic
simulation, especially with contact and friction modeling, present a potential
design tool for mechanical compliance. We propose a simulation-based design
tool for compliant mechanisms which allows design with respect to task-level
objectives, such as success rate. This is applied to optimize design parameters
of a structured compliant finger to reduce failure cases inside a tolerance
window in insertion tasks. The improvement in robustness is then validated on a
real robot using tasks from the benchmark NIST task board. The finger stiffness
affects the tolerance window: optimized parameters can increase tolerable
ranges by a factor of 2.29, with workpiece variation up to 8.6 mm being
compensated. However, the trends remain task-specific. In some tasks, the
highest stiffness yields the widest tolerable range, whereas in others the
opposite is observed, motivating need for design tools which can consider
application-specific geometry and dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines two spherical robots designed for mapping in challenging environments, showcasing unique strengths but identifying challenges with existing localization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore spherical robots as a solution for mapping in hazardous or compact environments using LiDAR and lightweight frameworks.

Method: They developed two variants: a lightweight non-actuated model and an actuated one with pendulum-driven locomotion, both leveraging LiDAR-Inertial Odometry algorithms on limited hardware setups.

Result: Experiments revealed that high dynamic movements from spherical locomotion degrade the accuracy of current LIO algorithms, causing inconsistent mapping results and drift issues.

Conclusion: Spherical robots are promising for mapping, but existing algorithms struggle with dynamic movement, highlighting the need for improved localization systems in these applications.

Abstract: Spherical robots offer unique advantages for mapping applications in
hazardous or confined environments, thanks to their protective shells and
omnidirectional mobility. This work presents two complementary spherical
mapping systems: a lightweight, non-actuated design and an actuated variant
featuring internal pendulum-driven locomotion. Both systems are equipped with a
Livox Mid-360 solid-state LiDAR sensor and run LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO)
algorithms on resource-constrained hardware. We assess the mapping accuracy of
these systems by comparing the resulting 3D point-clouds from the LIO
algorithms to a ground truth map. The results indicate that the performance of
state-of-the-art LIO algorithms deteriorates due to the high dynamic movement
introduced by the spherical locomotion, leading to globally inconsistent maps
and sometimes unrecoverable drift.

*Xiyan Huang,Zhe Xu,Chenxi Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TwinTac, a system integrating a physical tactile sensor with a digital twin model for improved reinforcement learning in tactile-driven tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning struggles to incorporate tactile perception due to the lack of simulation models for tactile sensors, hindering skill learning in object interactions.

Method: The proposed system includes a high-sensitivity tactile sensor and a digital twin model generated through neural networks mapping real sensor data to simulated outputs, leveraging a real-to-sim approach.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrated high sensitivity of the physical sensor and accurate replication by the digital twin, with enhanced object classification accuracy using simulation data.

Conclusion: TwinTac bridges the gap between physical and simulated tactile sensing, enabling cross-domain learning and improving the development of tactile-driven policies.

Abstract: Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely
on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However,
the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of
tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of
effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present
TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with
its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity
and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for
object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the
digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting
synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the
physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated
data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we
characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the
consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor's output.
Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that
simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment
real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight
TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks.

*Hauzi Cao,Jiahao Shen,Zhengzhen Li,Qinquan Ren,Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel control framework for aerial manipulators to achieve kinematic tracking control within specified time constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve tracking objectives within specific time limits due to their feedback-based strategies.

Method: The authors introduce a control framework with two components: 1) user-defined end-effector trajectory tracking control, and 2) quadratic programming-based resource allocation while respecting physical constraints.

Result: Experiments validate the method, showing that it ensures timely target position achievement and maintains tracking error within required performance levels.

Conclusion: The proposed method can efficiently handle kinematic tracking with adherence to time and physical constraints, outperforming conventional approaches.

Abstract: This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial
manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically
employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback
strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework
comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a
user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference
allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has
several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches
the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error
within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second,
quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter
base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the
aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical
limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the
preset time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of labor shortages and aging populations by developing robots capable of accurate human motion prediction in physical interactions.

Method: Developed HHI-Assist dataset and employed a conditional Transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict poses in assistive scenarios.

Result: The model captures coupled dynamics between interacting agents, surpassing baselines and generalizing to new situations.

Conclusion: This work advances assistive robot capabilities by introducing impactful resources for interaction-aware motion prediction.

Abstract: The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for
assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and
responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in
physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to
the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in
physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two
key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of
human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional
Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of
interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between
caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and
strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware
motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to
significantly enhance robotic assistance policies. The dataset and code are

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots to ensure energy-efficient locomotion across different gravity environments, validated through simulation and real tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planetary robots face constraints with power and thermal budgets when exploring low-gravity bodies, requiring energy-efficient and adaptable control methods.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based control technique using gravity-scaled, power-optimized reward functions, combined with a constant-force spring offload system for lunar gravity experimentation.

Result: The locomotion controller achieved a power consumption of 23.4 W in Earth gravity, a 23% improvement, and 12.2 W in lunar gravity, 36% lower than the baseline policy.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully delivers power-efficient controllers that scale well across different gravity environments for legged robots.

Abstract: Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on
low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their
advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power
and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient
control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In
this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for
legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our
approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose
controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a
hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across
these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the
gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller
reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a
15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy.
Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed
us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In
lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less
than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our
method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion
controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and cost-effective alternative to
LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems by combining complementary sensing

GundamQ improves spatiotemporal features extraction and training policy optimization, achieving superior path planning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic path planning struggles with adaptability in dynamic environments due to inadequate modeling of temporal dependencies and inefficient exploration-exploitation mechanisms.

Method: The study introduces GundamQ, incorporating a Spatiotemporal Perception module for extracting hierarchical spatial and temporal features, and an Adaptive Policy Optimization module to refine exploration and exploitation balance through constrained policy updates.

Result: GundamQ achieves a 15.3% increase in success rate and a 21.7% enhancement in overall path quality compared to state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: GundamQ resolves major issues in DRL-based robotic path planning, offering a robust solution for dynamic and uncertain environments with improved success rate and path quality.

Abstract: In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate
spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making
under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based
path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient
modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation
balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we
propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path
Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal
Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial
features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to
extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic
environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances
exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness
and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in
dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in
success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly
outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To address limitations like manual configuration, low flexibility, and unnatural behaviors in traditional robot systems.

Method: A two-stage process for tour scenario generation (stylized narrative creation and adding non-verbal action tags) paired with a multi-agent system for coordination.

Result: Trials demonstrate that this approach enables more natural robot behavior and supports better scalability of control systems.

Conclusion: The hybrid system enhances flexibility, naturalness, and automation in social robot behavior control, showing promise for broader applications.

Abstract: The work describes the development of a hybrid control architecture for an
anthropomorphic tour guide robot, combining a multi-agent resource management
system with automatic behavior scenario generation based on large language
models. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional
systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations
include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot
behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a
two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal
action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures
coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions,
as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main
operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enhance the capabilities of UAVs carrying suspended payloads by addressing challenges such as unreliable cable-payload dynamics perception, inefficient planning, and safety concerns in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed system, Acetrans, integrates a LiDAR-IMU module for payload pose and cable shape estimation, the MACIRI algorithm for scalable flight planning, trajectory optimization schemes for collision avoidance, and NMPC with cable-bending constraints for robust safety during operational execution.

Result: Simulation and experimental validation show that Acetrans significantly improves perception accuracy, planning efficiency, and operational safety compared to current approaches.

Conclusion: Acetrans effectively bridges critical gaps in UAV suspended transport systems, providing a unified framework that enhances robustness, scalability, and safety in complex environments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with suspended payloads offer significant
advantages for aerial transportation in complex and cluttered environments.
However, existing systems face critical limitations, including unreliable
perception of the cable-payload dynamics, inefficient planning in large-scale
environments, and the inability to guarantee whole-body safety under cable
bending and external disturbances. This paper presents Acetrans, an Autonomous,
Corridor-based, and Efficient UAV suspended transport system that addresses
these challenges through a unified perception, planning, and control framework.
A LiDAR-IMU fusion module is proposed to jointly estimate both payload pose and
cable shape under taut and bent modes, enabling robust whole-body state
estimation and real-time filtering of cable point clouds. To enhance planning
scalability, we introduce the Multi-size-Aware Configuration-space Iterative
Regional Inflation (MACIRI) algorithm, which generates safe flight corridors
while accounting for varying UAV and payload geometries. A spatio-temporal,
corridor-constrained trajectory optimization scheme is then developed to ensure
dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Finally, a nonlinear
model predictive controller (NMPC) augmented with cable-bending constraints
provides robust whole-body safety during execution. Simulation and experimental
results validate the effectiveness of Acetrans, demonstrating substantial
improvements in perception accuracy, planning efficiency, and control safety
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for estimating a ground robot’s relative pose using monocular RGB images without pose labels or prior knowledge of robot design, relying on LED states and a known calibration image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robot pose estimation often require external supervision, precise pose labels, or CAD models, which are restrictive and limit practical application.

Method: The model trains to predict the state of LEDs on the robot image, learning positional, distance, and bearing data without external infrastructure. Training data comes from two randomly moving robots. A calibration image with known distance resolves depth ambiguity.

Result: The approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art supervised methods, generalizes across domains, and supports pose estimation for multiple robots.

Conclusion: This unsupervised LED-based model enables flexible and accurate robot pose estimation without reliance on labeled datasets or CAD models, offering practical advantages in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground
robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about
the robot's shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot
fitted with multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each
frame; (ii) knowledge of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and
(iii) availability of a calibration image with a known target distance, to
address the ambiguity of monocular depth estimation. Training data is collected
by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or
human supervision. Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the
state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it learns to predict the position
of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing. At inference
time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect
the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate that our
approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose
labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and
handles multi-robot pose estimation.

TASC constructs an open-vocabulary interaction graph from visual input to
represent functional object relationships, and infers user intent accordingly.
A shared control policy then provides rotation assistance during both grasping
and object interaction, guided by spatial constraints predicted by a
vision-language model. Our method addresses two key challenges in
general-purpose, long-horizon shared control: (1) understanding and inferring
task-level user intent, and (2) generalizing assistance across diverse objects
and tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that
TASC improves task efficiency and reduces user input effort compared to prior
methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared control
framework that supports everyday manipulation tasks with zero-shot
generalization. The code that supports our experiments is publicly available at
https://github.com/fitz0401/tasc.

*Jianxin Shi,Zengqi Peng,Xiaolong Chen,Tianyu Wo,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DECAMP, a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction in autonomous driving, addressing issues of data scarcity and suboptimal performance in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory prediction face challenges due to limited labeled data and inefficiency in handling multi-agent scenarios. The goal is to improve safety and efficiency in autonomous driving.

Method: DECAMP decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction and incorporates context-aware representation learning with collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks. This allows for better scene representation and joint optimization of reasoning capabilities.

Result: Experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of DECAMP compared to existing methods in multi-agent motion forecasting.

Conclusion: DECAMP enhances interpretability and effectiveness in autonomous driving multi-agent motion forecasting, establishing itself as the first context autoencoder framework of its kind. The code and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving,
essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However,
traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and
exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address
these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training
framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing
methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework
decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction,
prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation
for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates
context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion
pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional
reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on
the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and
the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion
forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context
autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving.
The code and models will be made publicly available.

*Chaerim Moon,Joohyung Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a motion planning layer for wearable Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) to minimize external torque acting on the human body, enhancing Human-Robot Interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of external torque generated by SRLs, which increases muscle activation and can limit muscular null space, aiming to improve interaction and usability.

Method: The proposed motion planning layer modifies SRLs trajectories by introducing angular acceleration and position deviation limits to reduce generated moments.

Result: Simulation tests using simplified models of humans and robotic systems demonstrate the ability of the motion planning layer to reduce external torque.

Conclusion: Implementing the motion planning layer improves the Human-Robot Interaction by optimizing SRLs trajectories, potentially leading to safer and more effective usage in wearable robotics.

Abstract: Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can enhance human capability within close
proximity. However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its
operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments
increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in
reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a
motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced
Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular
acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the
moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and
robotic system models.

*Hang Yin,Haoyu Wei,Xiuwei Xu,Wenxuan Guo,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) by using graph constraint optimization, achieving significant improvements and generalization in zero-shot navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot VLN methods struggle to generalize in real-world continuous environments due to their reliance on either discrete environments or unsupervised training in simulators.

Method: The framework uses graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into spatial constraints and solving them with a constraint solver. A spatial constraint library and backtracking mechanisms handle edge cases like no solutions or multiple solutions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show improved success rates and efficiency, with the method also proven effective in real-world navigation tasks, enabling robust adaptation to new environments and instructions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust and innovative framework for training-free VLN, optimizing performance and real-world applicability without requiring prior training.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language
navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for
discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator
environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in
real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous
environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint
optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The
constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint
solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we
construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial
relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed
into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,
which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph
constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint
solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's
navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple
solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world
experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new
environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and
autonomous navigation framework.

### [224] [Stencil-Lifting: Hierarchical Recursive Lifting System for Extracting Summary of Stencil Kernel in Legacy Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10236)
*Mingyi Li,Junmin Xiao,Siyan Chen,Hui Ma,Xi Chen,Peihua Bao,Liang Yuan,Guangming Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Stencil-Lifting is a system that converts low-level stencil code into DSL implementations efficiently and with full semantic equivalence, achieving significant speedups over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in existing verified lifting systems for stencil kernels, particularly the need for scalable abstraction and computational correctness without relying on external verification.

Method: Stencil-Lifting uses a hierarchical recursive lifting theory, leveraging invariant subgraphs with predicate-based summaries to encode computational semantics, and a recursive lifting algorithm to guarantee termination and correctness.

Result: Stencil-Lifting demonstrates a 31.62× and 5.8× speedup over the verified lifting systems STNG and Dexter, respectively, when tested on stencil benchmarks and real-world applications, all while ensuring semantic equivalence.

Conclusion: The proposed system improves translation efficiency from low-level stencil kernels to DSLs, offering both speed and correctness, and serves as a bridge between traditional optimization techniques and modern DSL paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce Stencil-Lifting, a novel system for automatically converting
stencil kernels written in low-level languages in legacy code into semantically
equivalent Domain-Specific Language (DSL) implementations. Targeting the
efficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting
achieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations.
First, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents
stencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which
are customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and
structural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with
a predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing
self-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation
of correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the
need for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive
lifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive
process, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm
efficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its
completeness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil
benchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.
Experimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\times$
and 5.8$\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting
systems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic
equivalence. Our work significantly enhances the translation efficiency of
low-level stencil kernels to DSL implementations, effectively bridging the gap
between legacy optimization techniques and modern DSL-based paradigms.

*Zhiyu Fan,Kirill Vasilevski,Dayi Lin,Boyuan Chen,Yihao Chen,Zhiqing Zhong,Jie M. Zhang,Pinjia He,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Effi, a new metric that assesses AI systems' holistic effectiveness by balancing accuracy and resource consumption, especially for software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing AI evaluation methods, which focus solely on solution accuracy and neglect cost-effectiveness.

Method: The study re-ranks popular AI systems used for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark, employing new multi-dimensional metrics to measure effectiveness.

Result: It was found that effectiveness depends on both the scaffold and its integration with the base model. Challenges like 'token snowball' and 'expensive failures' were identified, along with trade-offs between token and time budget effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research underscores the need for considering resource efficiency along with task performance, providing valuable insights for improving AI utility in resource-sensitive contexts like software engineering.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has
demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks,
such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for
software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution
accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a
resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond
software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must
also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of
new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness
scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome
(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).
In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by
re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench
benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's
effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it
integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in
a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as
the "token snowball" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of "expensive
failures". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on
unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also
drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a
clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness
under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets
and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are
essential.

*James Jewitt,Hao Li,Bram Adams,Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates hidden license conflicts in open-source AI ecosystems, specifically on the Hugging Face platform, through an audit of datasets, models, and downstream software, uncovering systemic non-compliance and presenting tools to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the legal and ethical risks posed by hidden license conflicts in open-source AI, as no comprehensive data-driven study existed to assess their prevalence and impact.

Method: The authors perform an extensive audit covering 364k datasets, 1.6M models, and 140k GitHub projects, alongside the development of a rule engine designed to detect and address license conflicts.

Result: The analysis showed that 35.5% of model-to-application transitions breached license clauses by switching to more permissive terms. Their rule engine resolved 86.4% of detected conflicts.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of license compliance in open-source AI as a governance challenge and provides both actionable tools and datasets to advance compliance automation at scale.

Abstract: Hidden license conflicts in the open-source AI ecosystem pose serious legal
and ethical risks, exposing organizations to potential litigation and users to
undisclosed risk. However, the field lacks a data-driven understanding of how
frequently these conflicts occur, where they originate, and which communities
are most affected. We present the first end-to-end audit of licenses for
datasets and models on Hugging Face, as well as their downstream integration
into open-source software applications, covering 364 thousand datasets, 1.6
million models, and 140 thousand GitHub projects. Our empirical analysis
reveals systemic non-compliance in which 35.5% of model-to-application
transitions eliminate restrictive license clauses by relicensing under
permissive terms. In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that
encodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license
conflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications.
To support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine.
Our study highlights license compliance as a critical governance challenge in
open-source AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable
automated, AI-aware compliance at scale.

*Zehan Chen,Long Zhang,Zhiwei Zhang,JingJing Zhang,Ruoyu Zhou,Yulong Shen,JianFeng Ma,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SLD-Spec improves specification generation for complex loop programs, achieving better correctness, relevance, and completeness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based specification tools struggle with complex loops in programs, often generating irrelevant or ambiguous specifications.

Method: SLD-Spec introduces slicing to simplify loop structures and logical deletion to filter incorrect specifications using LLM-based reasoning.

Result: SLD-Spec verifies more programs (+5) than AutoSpec, reduces runtime by 23.73%, and passes 95.1% of assertions and 90.91% of programs in experimental datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of slicing and logical deletion enhances specification generation, providing more reliable automation for challenging programs with complex loops.

Abstract: Automatically generating formal specifications from program code can greatly
enhance the efficiency of program verification and enable end-to-end automation
from requirements to reliable software. However, existing LLM-based approaches
often struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to
irrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design
constraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and
ambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an
LLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex
loop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional
specification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each
function into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby
reducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion
phase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate
specifications--especially those not easily identified by verification
tool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple
dataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the
state-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the
limitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising
four categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec
significantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of
generated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of
assertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification. Ablation studies
further reveal that logical deletion is critical for enhancing specification
correctness and relevance, while program slicing contributes significantly to
specification completeness. Our code and data are publicly available.

requires efficient issue detection, resolution, and evaluation tools. This
paper presents WALL, a web application that integrates SonarQube and large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o to automate these
tasks. WALL comprises three modules: an issue extraction tool, code issues
reviser, and code comparison tool. Together, they enable a seamless pipeline
for detecting software issues, generating automated code revisions, and
evaluating the accuracy of revisions. Our experiments, conducted on 563 files
with over 7,599 issues, demonstrate WALL's effectiveness in reducing human
effort while maintaining high-quality revisions. Results show that employing a
hybrid approach of cost-effective and advanced LLMs can significantly lower
costs and improve revision rates. Future work aims to enhance WALL's
capabilities by integrating open-source LLMs and eliminating human
intervention, paving the way for fully automated code quality management.

*Humza Ashraf,Syed Muhammad Danish,Zeeshan Sattar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether prompt engineering can improve the energy efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs) in code generation, with mixed results depending on the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high energy usage and carbon footprint of Large Language Models (LLMs) by exploring whether SLMs can be made more energy-efficient for programming tasks through prompt engineering.

Method: Four open-source SLMs were tested on 150 Python problems at various difficulty levels using four prompting strategies, measuring runtime, memory usage, and energy consumption for comparison against a human-written baseline.

Result: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieved consistent energy savings for Qwen2.5-Coder and StableCode-3B, while CodeLlama-7B and Phi-3-Mini-4K could not outperform the baseline under any prompting strategy.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering has the potential to enhance the energy efficiency of SLMs, but its effectiveness is model-dependent, emphasizing the need for tailored prompt designs to promote greener software development.

Abstract: There is a growing concern about the environmental impact of large language
models (LLMs) in software development, particularly due to their high energy
use and carbon footprint. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a more sustainable
alternative, requiring fewer computational resources while remaining effective
for fundamental programming tasks. In this study, we investigate whether prompt
engineering can improve the energy efficiency of SLMs in code generation. We
evaluate four open-source SLMs, StableCode-Instruct-3B,
Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, CodeLlama-7B-Instruct, and Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct,
across 150 Python problems from LeetCode, evenly distributed into easy, medium,
and hard categories. Each model is tested under four prompting strategies: role
prompting, zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). For every generated
solution, we measure runtime, memory usage, and energy consumption, comparing
the results with a human-written baseline. Our findings show that CoT prompting
provides consistent energy savings for Qwen2.5-Coder and StableCode-3B, while
CodeLlama-7B and Phi-3-Mini-4K fail to outperform the baseline under any
prompting strategy. These results highlight that the benefits of prompting are
model-dependent and that carefully designed prompts can guide SLMs toward
greener software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of reviewing software design documents by leveraging LLMs for a task traditionally reliant on human effort.

Method: The authors analyzed 11 review perspectives, identified challenges in utilizing LLMs, refined LLM techniques to understand complex design documents, and conducted evaluations using GPT in real-world design processes.

Result: The experiments showed that LLMs, specifically GPT, were effective in identifying inconsistencies in software design documents, proving their utility in this task.

Conclusion: LLMs can partially automate the review process of software design documents, especially for identifying inconsistencies, reducing dependency on human reviewers.

Abstract: In this study, we explored an approach to automate the review process of
software design documents by using LLM. We first analyzed the review methods of
design documents and organized 11 review perspectives. Additionally, we
analyzed the issues of utilizing LLMs for these 11 review perspectives and
determined which perspectives can be reviewed by current general-purpose LLMs
instead of humans. For the reviewable perspectives, we specifically developed
new techniques to enable LLMs to comprehend complex design documents that
include table data. For evaluation, we conducted experiments using GPT to
assess the consistency of design items and descriptions across different design
documents in the design process used in actual business operations. Our results
confirmed that LLMs can be utilized to identify inconsistencies in software
design documents during the review process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of research software to poor maintainability, adaptability, and obsolescence.

Method: The paper uses fitness functions from evolutionary architecture to create tailored metrics promoting modularity, documentation, and versioning.

Result: Case studies and experiments showed enhanced long-term findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research software.

Conclusion: Promoting fitness function metrics in software development cycles can bridge gaps between ephemeral development approaches and enduring scientific usability.

Abstract: The long-term sustainability of research software is a critical challenge, as
it usually suffers from poor maintainability, lack of adaptability, and
eventual obsolescence. This paper proposes a novel approach to addressing this
issue by leveraging the concept of fitness functions from evolutionary
architecture. Fitness functions are automated, continuously evaluated metrics
designed to ensure that software systems meet desired non-functional,
architectural qualities over time. We define a set of fitness functions
tailored to the unique requirements of research software, focusing on
findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). These
fitness functions act as proactive safeguards, promoting practices such as
modular design, comprehensive documentation, version control, and compatibility
with evolving technological ecosystems. By integrating these metrics into the
development life cycle, we aim to foster a culture of sustainability within the
research community. Case studies and experimental results demonstrate the
potential of this approach to enhance the long-term FAIR of research software,
bridging the gap between ephemeral project-based development and enduring
scientific impact.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates the energy efficiency of Python code generated by LLMs compared to human-written and Green software expert-developed code, finding that LLMs lag behind Green experts in energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in development has raised questions about the energy efficiency of the code they generate compared to human developers.

Method: The authors tested 363 solutions to coding problems using 6 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques, measuring energy consumption on three hardware platforms: server, PC, and Raspberry Pi, over 881 hours.

Result: Human-written code was more energy-efficient on a server (16%) and Raspberry Pi (3%), while LLMs slightly outperformed humans on a PC (25%). The Green software expert's code was 17-30% more energy-efficient than all LLMs across all platforms. Prompting effectiveness varied by platform.

Conclusion: LLMs cannot yet produce code as energy-efficient as expert developers. Human expertise remains essential for energy-efficient Python development despite LLM advancements.

Abstract: Context. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread
adoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy
efficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code
developed by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding
problems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting
techniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption
is measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a
Raspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16%
more energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs
outperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently
lead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by
hardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is
consistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on
all hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good
code generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient
than that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of
today there is still a great need of human expertise for developing
energy-efficient Python code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently managing testing in expanding codebases and frequent commit environments poses a challenge.

Method: Develops a machine learning approach using Bags-of-Words representation for changed files, predictive features, and avoids coverage maps.

Result: T-TS selects 15% of tests, reduces execution time by $5.9\times$, accelerates pipelines by $5.6\times$, and detects over 95% of failures.

Conclusion: T-TS enhances test efficiency and fault detection while being accessible for further research and industry applications.

Abstract: In modern software development change-based testing plays a crucial role.
However, as codebases expand and test suites grow, efficiently managing the
testing process becomes increasingly challenging, especially given the high
frequency of daily code commits. We propose Targeted Test Selection (T-TS), a
machine learning approach for industrial test selection. Our key innovation is
a data representation that represent commits as Bags-of-Words of changed files,
incorporates cross-file and additional predictive features, and notably avoids
the use of coverage maps. Deployed in production, T-TS was comprehensively
evaluated against industry standards and recent methods using both internal and
public datasets, measuring time efficiency and fault detection. On live
industrial data, T-TS selects only 15% of tests, reduces execution time by
$5.9\times$, accelerates the pipeline by $5.6\times$, and detects over 95% of
test failures. The implementation is publicly available to support further
research and practical adoption.

### [234] [Developer-LLM Conversations: An Empirical Study of Interactions and Generated Code Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10402)
*Suzhen Zhong,Ying Zou,Bram Adams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how developers interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world programming scenarios using a dataset of 82,845 conversations, highlighting their conversational dynamics, prevalent issues in generated code, and error-resolution strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between developers and LLMs, analyze conversational dynamics, and measure the impact on code quality and development workflows.

Method: The study analyzes CodeChat, a dataset based on real-world developer-LLM conversations covering over 368,506 code snippets across 20+ programming languages, with a focus on evaluating generated code quality and conversational dynamics.

Result: The study finds that LLM responses are significantly longer than prompts, multi-turn conversations are common, and both prevalent and language-specific issues exist in generated code. Effective error resolution occurs when developers explicitly point out issues and request fixes.

Conclusion: LLMs are widely used but generate code with non-trivial, often language-specific errors. Developers can improve outcomes by engaging directly and iteratively, especially by flagging flaws and asking for direct corrections.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to modern software
development workflows, assisting developers with code generation, API
explanation, and iterative problem-solving through natural language
conversations. Despite widespread adoption, there is limited understanding of
how developers interact with LLMs in practice and how these conversational
dynamics influence task outcomes, code quality, and software engineering
workflows. To address this, we leverage CodeChat, a large dataset comprising
82,845 real-world developer-LLM conversations, containing 368,506 code snippets
generated across over 20 programming languages, derived from the WildChat
dataset. We find that LLM responses are substantially longer than developer
prompts, with a median token-length ratio of 14:1. Multi-turn conversations
account for 68% of the dataset and often evolve due to shifting requirements,
incomplete prompts, or clarification requests. Topic analysis identifies web
design (9.6% of conversations) and neural network training (8.7% of
conversations) as the most frequent LLM-assisted tasks. Evaluation across five
languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and C#) reveals prevalent and

### [235] [DCHO: A Decomposition-Composition Framework for Predicting Higher-Order Brain Connectivity to Enhance Diverse Downstream Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09696)
*Weibin Li,Wendu Li,Quanying Liu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCHO, a framework for modeling and predicting higher-order brain connectivity (HOBC) dynamics, addressing limitations in static analyses with strong results in state classification and brain dynamics forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOBC offers richer organizational insights than traditional functional connectivity, but current methods for analyzing it are static and unsuitable for dynamic prediction tasks.

Method: The paper presents a Decomposition-Composition framework (DCHO) with a dual-view encoder for multiscale topological and HOBC feature extraction, and a latent-space prediction loss for trajectory forecasting.

Result: DCHO outperforms existing methods in both state classification (non-predictive tasks) and brain dynamics forecasting (predictive tasks) across multiple neuroimaging datasets.

Conclusion: DCHO is a significant advancement in HOBC modeling, proving its effectiveness for both predictive and non-predictive dynamic neuroimaging analysis tasks.

Abstract: Higher-order brain connectivity (HOBC), which captures interactions among
three or more brain regions, provides richer organizational information than
traditional pairwise functional connectivity (FC). Recent studies have begun to
infer latent HOBC from noninvasive imaging data, but they mainly focus on
static analyses, limiting their applicability in dynamic prediction tasks. To
address this gap, we propose DCHO, a unified approach for modeling and
forecasting the temporal evolution of HOBC based on a Decomposition-Composition
framework, which is applicable to both non-predictive tasks (state
classification) and predictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting). DCHO adopts
a decomposition-composition strategy that reformulates the prediction task into
two manageable subproblems: HOBC inference and latent trajectory prediction. In
the inference stage, we propose a dual-view encoder to extract multiscale
topological features and a latent combinatorial learner to capture high-level
HOBC information. In the forecasting stage, we introduce a latent-space
prediction loss to enhance the modeling of temporal trajectories. Extensive
experiments on multiple neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that DCHO achieves
superior performance in both non-predictive tasks (state classification) and
predictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting), significantly outperforming
existing methods.

### [236] [Cerebellar Contributions to Action and Cognition: Prediction, Timescale, and Continuity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09818)
*Jonathan Tsay,Richard Ivry*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated approach to understand cerebellar contributions to cognition, highlighting functional specialization and common computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on cerebellar functions in cognition lack a unified framework, creating a gap in identifying consistent principles across various cognitive domains.

Method: The authors propose a perspective focusing on functional specialization alongside identifying three universal constraints of cerebellar computations: Prediction, Timescale, and Continuity.

Result: The paper outlines these core constraints, arguing they define boundary conditions for cerebellar involvement in cognition and eliminate inappropriate computational assumptions.

Conclusion: An integrated model combining specialization and universal constraints enhances understanding of when and how the cerebellum supports cognition.

Abstract: The cerebellum is implicated in nearly every domain of human cognition, yet
our understanding of how this subcortical structure contributes to cognition
remains elusive. Efforts on this front have tended to fall into one of two
camps. On one side are those who seek to identify a universal cerebellar
transform, a single algorithm that can be applied across domains as diverse as
sensorimotor learning, social cognition, and decision making. On the other side
are those who focus on functional specializations tailored for different task
domains. In this perspective, we propose an integrated approach, one that
recognizes functional specialization across different cerebellar subregions,
but also builds on common constraints that help define the conditions that
engage the cerebellum. Drawing on recurring principles from the cerebellum's
well-established role in motor control, we identify three core constraints:
Prediction - the cerebellum performs anticipatory, not reactive, computations;
Timescale - the cerebellum generates predictions limited to short intervals;
and Continuity - the cerebellum transforms continuous representations such as
space and time. Together, these constraints define the boundary conditions
underlying when and how the cerebellum supports cognition, and, just as
importantly, specify the types of computations that should not depend on the
cerebellum.

### [237] [The nature of alpha modulation through neurofeedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10046)
*Jacob Maaz,Laurent Waroquier,Alexandra Dia,Véronique Paban,Arnaud Rey*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: EEG neurofeedback (EEG-NF), particularly alpha modulation, may not rely on volitional control but rather on spontaneous processes unrelated to feedback credibility or engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of alpha EEG neurofeedback in inducing volitional brain activity modulation, addressing unresolved questions about specific versus non-specific influences.

Method: A preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled, single-session design was used with three groups: genuine EEG-NF, sham feedback, and passive control, measuring changes in alpha power and other EEG rhythms.

Result: Alpha power increased robustly across all groups, regardless of feedback veracity or active engagement, alongside parallel increases in theta and sensorimotor rhythms indicating non-specific, broadband modulation.

Conclusion: The findings argue against the foundational assumption of EEG-NF as a volitional EEG control technique, suggesting spontaneous repetition-related processes as the primary driver and calling for reevaluation of its mechanisms and efficacy.

Abstract: Electroencephalographic neurofeedback (EEG-NF) has been proposed as a
promising technique to modulate brain activity through real-time EEG-based
feedback. Alpha neurofeedback in particular is believed to induce rapid
self-regulation of brain rhythms, with applications in cognitive enhancement
and clinical treatment. However, whether this modulation reflects specific
volitional control or non-specific influences remains unresolved. In a
preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study, we evaluated alpha
upregulation in healthy participants receiving either genuine or sham EEG-NF
during a single-session design. A third arm composed of a passive control group
was also included to differentiate between non-specific influences related or
not to the active engagement in EEG-NF. Throughout the session, alpha power
increased robustly, yet independently of feedback veracity, engagement in
self-regulation, or feedback update frequency. Parallel increases in theta and
sensorimotor rhythms further suggest broadband non-specific modulation.
Importantly, these results challenge the foundational assumption of EEG-NF:
that feedback enables volitional EEG control. Instead, they point to
spontaneous repetition-related processes as primary drivers, calling for a
critical reassessment of neurofeedback efficacy and its underlying mechanisms.

*Daniele Andrean,Morten Gram Pedersen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study applies principles of physics, such as energy conservation, to neural mass models, showing their Hamiltonian properties under specific conditions and connecting these to brain behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether fundamental physics concepts can enhance the understanding of neural mass models and their application to neuronal population dynamics and brain behavior.

Method: By applying time-rescaling to next-generation neural mass models, the study demonstrates their Hamiltonian nature under strong coupling or homogeneous settings. It also extends the analysis to heterogeneous cases using energy-like quantities.

Result: The energy-like quantities help explain orbital shapes and predict spike amplitudes during bursting dynamics, suggesting a connection to energy landscape theory used in brain data analysis.

Conclusion: The introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions for neuronal activity could bridge neuroscience and advanced physics theories, offering deeper insights into brain behavior.

Abstract: Neural mass models describe the mean-field dynamics of populations of
neurons. In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as
energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that
time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in
the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding
energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even
in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are
near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We
illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between
neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used
to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian
descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly
developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.

### [239] [An Information-Theoretic Framework for Credit Risk Modeling: Unifying Industry Practice with Statistical Theory for Fair and Interpretable Scorecards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09855)
*Agus Sudjianto,Denis Burakov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes a unified information-theoretic framework for credit risk metrics (WoE, IV, PSI), revealing their connection to classical information divergences and presenting tools for balancing accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical foundation for industry-standard metrics like WoE, IV, and PSI in credit risk modeling and propose a unified framework.

Method: The paper uses information-theoretic principles, the delta method for deriving statistical errors, and automated binning techniques with optimization strategies to evaluate encoding methods.

Result: It demonstrates that IV equals PSI under specific conditions, formulates performance-fairness trade-offs, and achieves comparable predictive performance across three methods (AUC 0.82-0.84).

Conclusion: The framework bridges theory and practice by establishing a rigorous statistical foundation for credit risk metrics and tools for accuracy-fairness balance in regulated environments.

Abstract: Credit risk modeling relies extensively on Weight of Evidence (WoE) and
Information Value (IV) for feature engineering, and Population Stability Index
(PSI) for drift monitoring, yet their theoretical foundations remain
disconnected. We establish a unified information-theoretic framework revealing
these industry-standard metrics as instances of classical information
divergences. Specifically, we prove that IV exactly equals PSI (Jeffreys
divergence) computed between good and bad credit outcomes over identical bins.
Through the delta method applied to WoE transformations, we derive standard
errors for IV and PSI, enabling formal hypothesis testing and probabilistic
fairness constraints for the first time. We formalize credit modeling's
inherent performance-fairness trade-off as maximizing IV for predictive power
while minimizing IV for protected attributes. Using automated binning with
depth-1 XGBoost stumps, we compare three encoding strategies: logistic
regression with one-hot encoding, WoE transformation, and constrained XGBoost.
All methods achieve comparable predictive performance (AUC 0.82-0.84),
demonstrating that principled, information-theoretic binning outweighs encoding
choice. Mixed-integer programming traces Pareto-efficient solutions along the
performance-fairness frontier with uncertainty quantification. This framework
bridges theory and practice, providing the first rigorous statistical
foundation for widely-used credit risk metrics while offering principled tools
for balancing accuracy and fairness in regulated environments.

### [240] [Repulsive Monte Carlo on the sphere for the sliced Wasserstein distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10166)
*Vladimir Petrovic,Rémi Bardenet,Agnès Desolneux*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study explores Monte Carlo methods to compute integrals on unit spheres in any dimension, particularly applied to estimating the sliced Wasserstein distance. It benchmarks methods like determinantal and repelled point processes, analyzing variance reduction and recommending efficient strategies for integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need for effective and computationally efficient methods to estimate the sliced Wasserstein distance, which is relevant in machine learning and mitigates the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The research employs Monte Carlo methods, benchmarks quadratures from existing literature like random point processes, and analyzes methods like DPPs, repelled quadratures, and the UnifOrtho estimator.

Result: The study finds that randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods work best in low dimensions, while the UnifOrtho estimator excels in high dimensions. DPP-based and repelled quadratures show moderate variance reduction but need further theoretical refinement.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that computational efficiency in integrating functions on spheres varies by dimensionality, with specific methods suited for low or high dimensions. Repelled quadratures need more theoretical development to be widely robust.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the integral of a
function on the unit sphere, in any dimension, using Monte Carlo methods.
Although the methods we present are general, our guiding thread is the sliced
Wasserstein distance between two measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is precisely
an integral on the $d$-dimensional sphere. The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW)
has gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less
computationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own
right, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of
dimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for
the sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on
quadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,
negative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted
to the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate
quadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)
and repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the
literature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically
benchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho
estimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on
UnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large
dimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final
recommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use
randomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \emph{UnifOrtho} in large
dimensions. DPP-based quadratures only shine when quasi-Monte Carlo also does,
while repelled quadratures show moderate variance reduction in general, but
more theoretical effort is needed to make them robust.

### [241] [Why does your graph neural network fail on some graphs? Insights from exact generalisation error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10337)
*Nil Ayday,Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam,Debarghya Ghoshdastidar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper derives the exact generalisation error for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through signal processing, revealing factors impacting their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplained performance variability in similar GNN architectures and identify what governs their ability to generalize effectively on graph-structured data.

Method: The authors analyze GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting using signal processing concepts, focusing on linear GNNs but allowing non-linearity in graph filters to derive exact generalisation error.

Result: They provide the first exact generalisation error characterisation for various GNNs and demonstrate how aligned node features and graph structure, along with homophily, influence generalisation.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into when and why GNNs can successfully leverage graph structure and node features, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing effective models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in learning on graph-structured
data, yet a principled understanding of why they succeed or fail remains
elusive. While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to
extract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically
between similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of
generalisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on
unlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error
bounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single
architecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in
practice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact
generalisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through
the lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as
graph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By
focusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we
derive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs,
including convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact
characterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned
information between node features and graph structure contributes to
generalisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on
generalisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs
can effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical
guidance for model selection.

### [242] [Differentially Private Decentralized Dataset Synthesis Through Randomized Mixing with Correlated Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10385)
*Utsab Saha,Tanvir Muntakim Tonoy,Hafiz Imtiaz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper enhances differentially private synthetic data generation in federated settings by introducing a CAPE-assisted DP-CDA framework, which balances the privacy-utility trade-off through anti-correlated noise generation among clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the utility degradation of DP-CDA in decentralized settings due to smaller local datasets and higher noise requirements.

Method: The CAPE-Assisted Federated DP-CDA algorithm incorporates the CAPE protocol for generating anti-correlated noise among clients to reduce the privacy-utility trade-off while upholding privacy standards.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets show that the proposed approach achieves utility comparable to centralized methods under certain parameter settings while maintaining strong differential privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed CAPE-Assisted Federated DP-CDA framework offers a promising solution to the challenges of generating utility-preserving differentially private synthetic data in federated settings.

Abstract: In this work, we explore differentially private synthetic data generation in
a decentralized-data setting by building on the recently proposed
Differentially Private Class-Centric Data Aggregation (DP-CDA). DP-CDA
synthesizes data in a centralized setting by mixing multiple randomly-selected
samples from the same class and injecting carefully calibrated Gaussian noise,
ensuring ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy. When deployed in a
decentralized or federated setting, where each client holds only a small
partition of the data, DP-CDA faces new challenges. The limited sample size per
client increases the sensitivity of local computations, requiring higher noise
injection to maintain the differential privacy guarantee. This, in turn, leads
to a noticeable degradation in the utility compared to the centralized setting.
To mitigate this issue, we integrate the Correlation-Assisted Private
Estimation (CAPE) protocol into the federated DP-CDA framework and propose CAPE
Assisted Federated DP-CDA algorithm. CAPE enables limited collaboration among
the clients by allowing them to generate jointly distributed (anti-correlated)
noise that cancels out in aggregate, while preserving privacy at the individual
level. This technique significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off in
the federated setting. Extensive experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CAPE Assisted Federated DP-CDA approach can
achieve utility comparable to its centralized counterpart under some parameter
regime, while maintaining rigorous differential privacy guarantees.

*Clémentine Chazal,Heishiro Kanagawa,Zheyang Shen,Anna Korba,Chris. J. Oates*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'kernel gradient discrepancy' (KGD) for optimizing entropy-regularized variational objectives when explicit unnormalized densities aren't available. This metric helps design novel algorithms and measure their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging post-Bayesian methods need effective measures for optimization when explicit unnormalized densities are unavailable.

Method: Defines a new metric, kernel gradient discrepancy (KGD), and uses it to assess variational gradients, enabling novel algorithm development.

Result: KGD is connected to kernel Stein discrepancy, allowing generalizations of methods like Stein variational gradient descent. Applications include neural networks and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: KGD provides a robust tool for algorithmic development and analysis in scenarios where explicit unnormalized densities can't be computed.

Abstract: Several emerging post-Bayesian methods target a probability distribution for
which an entropy-regularised variational objective is minimised. This increased
flexibility introduces a computational challenge, as one loses access to an
explicit unnormalised density for the target. To mitigate this difficulty, we
introduce a novel measure of suboptimality called 'gradient discrepancy', and
in particular a 'kernel gradient discrepancy' (KGD) that can be explicitly
computed. In the standard Bayesian context, KGD coincides with the kernel Stein
discrepancy (KSD), and we obtain a novel charasterisation of KSD as measuring
the size of a variational gradient. Outside this familiar setting, KGD enables
novel sampling algorithms to be developed and compared, even when unnormalised
densities cannot be obtained. To illustrate this point several novel algorithms
are proposed, including a natural generalisation of Stein variational gradient
descent, with applications to mean-field neural networks and prediction-centric
uncertainty quantification presented. On the theoretical side, our principal
contribution is to establish sufficient conditions for desirable properties of
KGD, such as continuity and convergence control.

*Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Junno Yun,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZADS, a zero-shot adaptive method for optimized diffusion sampling in accelerated MRI reconstruction, achieving better reconstruction under diverse noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative priors in diffusion models for MRI reconstruction, eliminating dependency on heuristics or fixed fidelity weights, especially under varying conditions and noise levels.

Method: ZADS employs test-time optimization to self-supervisedly adjust fidelity weights during the denoising process without retraining the diffusion model.

Result: Results indicate that ZADS outperforms conventional methods and existing diffusion schemes, achieving high fidelity in fastMRI knee dataset reconstructions.

Conclusion: ZADS offers an adaptable, effective approach for MRI reconstruction, addressing challenges in diverse acquisition and noise conditions without complex retraining processes.

Abstract: Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative
priors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction.
While their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the
learned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data
fidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising
steps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which
fail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep
schedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling
(ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights
across arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion
prior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and
optimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled
measurements. Experiments on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate that ZADS
consistently outperforms both traditional compressed sensing and recent
diffusion-based methods, showcasing its ability to deliver high-fidelity
reconstructions across varying noise schedules and acquisition settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study develops a drone-based multispectral deep learning system to detect broomrape in tomato fields, achieving high accuracy and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat of branched broomrape to California's tomato industry due to its undetectable underground life cycle and limitations of conventional chemical controls.

Method: Drone-based multispectral imagery combined with LSTM deep learning and SMOTE was employed to improve detection across growth stages.

Result: Detection accuracy reached 88.37% and recall 95.37% using sequential growth stage analysis and SMOTE for class balance.

Conclusion: This UAV and deep learning approach shows great promise for early detection of broomrape, supporting sustainable tomato farming.

Abstract: This study addresses the escalating threat of branched broomrape (Phelipanche
ramosa) to California's tomato industry, which supplies over 90 percent of U.S.
processing tomatoes. The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early
detection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,
environmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined
drone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep
learning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
to handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested
tomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages
determined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to
isolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with
79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating
later stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved
detection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all
growth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy
and 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of
temporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape
detection. While further real-world data collection is needed for practical
deployment, this study shows that UAV-based multispectral sensing coupled with
deep learning could provide a powerful precision agriculture tool to reduce
losses and improve sustainability in tomato production.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new dataset and method for simultaneous denoising and demosaicking of division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarimeter images, achieving better performance than existing alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DoFP polarimeters can capture images with multiple polarization orientations in a single shot, but the joint tasks of denoising and demosaicking have been underexplored due to missing evaluation datasets and baseline methods.

Method: A novel denoising-then-demosaicking approach is developed, leveraging well-accepted signal processing components, along with a newly created dataset featuring 40 real-world scenes under three noise levels.

Result: The presented method outperforms other current techniques in reconstructing high-quality images, establishing itself as a strong baseline.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and method pave the way for advancing joint denoising and demosaicking in DoFP polarimeter imaging, filling a gap in research and providing solid evaluation tools.

Abstract: A division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarimeter enables us to acquire images
with multiple polarization orientations in one shot and thus it is valuable for
many applications using polarimetric information. The image processing pipeline
for a DoFP polarimeter entails two crucial tasks: denoising and demosaicking.
While polarization demosaicking for a noise-free case has increasingly been
studied, the research for the joint task of polarization denoising and
demosaicking is scarce due to the lack of a suitable evaluation dataset and a
solid baseline method. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset and method for
polarization denoising and demosaicking. Our dataset contains 40 real-world
scenes and three noise-level conditions, consisting of pairs of noisy mosaic
inputs and noise-free full images. Our method takes a
denoising-then-demosaicking approach based on well-accepted signal processing
components to offer a reproducible method. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method exhibits higher image reconstruction performance than other
alternative methods, offering a solid baseline.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses overconfidence in deep learning for medical imaging, proposing uncertainty-aware mechanisms to improve reliability in multi-label chest X-ray classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfidence in deep learning models can lead to unreliable predictions in medical imaging tasks, potentially risking patient safety in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: A DenseNet-121 model is equipped with entropy-based and confidence interval-based rejection mechanisms to identify uncertain predictions, combined with a quantile-based calibration procedure for tuning rejection thresholds.

Result: Experiments on PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR datasets showed improved diagnostic accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest average AUC across pathologies.

Conclusion: Selective prediction mechanisms enhance diagnostic accuracy and safety, providing a step forward for safer AI-assisted workflows in clinical settings.

Abstract: Overconfidence in deep learning models poses a significant risk in
high-stakes medical imaging tasks, particularly in multi-label classification
of chest X-rays, where multiple co-occurring pathologies must be detected
simultaneously. This study introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for chest
X-ray diagnosis based on a DenseNet-121 backbone, enhanced with two selective
prediction mechanisms: entropy-based rejection and confidence interval-based
rejection. Both methods enable the model to abstain from uncertain predictions,
improving reliability by deferring ambiguous cases to clinical experts. A
quantile-based calibration procedure is employed to tune rejection thresholds
using either global or class-specific strategies. Experiments conducted on
three large public datasets (PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR)
demonstrate that selective rejection improves the trade-off between diagnostic
accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest
average AUC across all pathologies. These results support the integration of
selective prediction into AI-assisted diagnostic workflows, providing a
practical step toward safer, uncertainty-aware deployment of deep learning in
clinical settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pano, a physics-aware neural model, to improve the efficiency and quality of 3D photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), enabling real-time imaging with reduced hardware requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D PACT systems are hindered by the need for dense transducer arrays and long acquisition times, making them less feasible for clinical and preclinical use.

Method: The proposed method, Pano, uses a neural operator with spherical discrete-continuous convolutions and Helmholtz constraints to reconstruct high-quality images from minimal sensor data. It is resolution-agnostic and compatible with various sensor configurations.

Result: Pano reconstructs high-quality volumetric images from both simulated and experimental data. It maintains performance with fewer transducers and limited-angle measurements while enabling real-time imaging.

Conclusion: Pano offers a practical and efficient solution for 3D PACT, significantly reducing hardware costs and making it more accessible for clinical and research applications without sacrificing image quality.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) combines optical contrast with
ultrasonic resolution, achieving deep-tissue imaging beyond the optical
diffusion limit. While three-dimensional PACT systems enable high-resolution
volumetric imaging for applications spanning transcranial to breast imaging,
current implementations require dense transducer arrays and prolonged
acquisition times, limiting clinical translation. We introduce Pano (PACT
imaging neural operator), an end-to-end physics-aware model that directly
learns the inverse acoustic mapping from sensor measurements to volumetric
reconstructions. Unlike existing approaches (e.g. universal back-projection
algorithm), Pano learns both physics and data priors while also being agnostic
to the input data resolution. Pano employs spherical discrete-continuous
convolutions to preserve hemispherical sensor geometry, incorporates Helmholtz
equation constraints to ensure physical consistency and operates
resolutionindependently across varying sensor configurations. We demonstrate
the robustness and efficiency of Pano in reconstructing high-quality images
from both simulated and real experimental data, achieving consistent
performance even with significantly reduced transducer counts and limited-angle
acquisition configurations. The framework maintains reconstruction fidelity
across diverse sparse sampling patterns while enabling real-time volumetric
imaging capabilities. This advancement establishes a practical pathway for
making 3D PACT more accessible and feasible for both preclinical research and
clinical applications, substantially reducing hardware requirements without

### [249] [Chord: Chain of Rendering Decomposition for PBR Material Estimation from Generated Texture Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09952)
*Zhi Ying,Boxiang Rong,Jingyu Wang,Maoyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework leveraging diffusion models to facilitate PBR material generation with improved quality, flexibility, and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PBR material creation requires substantial time and skill from artists, and existing automated methods lack in quality and user adaptability.

Method: A two-stage process: 1) Generate stage uses a fine-tuned diffusion model to create texture images based on user inputs, and 2) Estimate stage sequentially predicts SVBRDF channels through chained decomposition using a single-step image-conditional diffusion model.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in material generation and estimation, showcasing robustness on both generated textures and real-world photographs.

Conclusion: This framework reduces effort in material creation while achieving high-quality results and flexible control for diverse applications including text-to-material, image-to-material, and material editing.

Abstract: Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but
traditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent
methods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from
user-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user
control. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR
material generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model
synthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the
estimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially
predicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as
input into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is
efficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our
approach against existing material generation and estimation methods,
demonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong
robustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore,
we highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications,
including text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and
material editing.

TL;DR: DBOS integrates web services, operating system functions, and database features with network sensing for enhanced resilience and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify web-deployment efforts while improving resilience using collaborative network sensing.

Method: The system integrates network sensing via GraphBLAS hypersparse traffic matrices using Python-GraphBLAS and OneSparse PostgreSQL, tested on the MIT SuperCloud.

Result: The web request rate exceeds $10^5$ with negligible overhead; implementations scaled linearly up to 64 and 32 nodes, respectively.

Conclusion: DBOS can achieve collaborative network awareness with minimal computational resource increases.

Abstract: DBOS (DataBase Operating System) is a novel capability that integrates web
services, operating system functions, and database features to significantly
reduce web-deployment effort while increasing resilience. Integration of high
performance network sensing enables DBOS web services to collaboratively create
a shared awareness of their network environments to enhance their collective
resilience and security. Network sensing is added to DBOS using GraphBLAS
hypersparse traffic matrices via two approaches: (1) Python-GraphBLAS and (2)
OneSparse PostgreSQL. These capabilities are demonstrated using the workflow
and analytics from the IEEE/MIT/Amazon Anonymized Network Sensing Graph
Challenge. The system was parallelized using pPython and benchmarked using 64
compute nodes on the MIT SuperCloud. The web request rate sustained by a single
DBOS instance was ${>}10^5$, well above the required maximum, indicating that
network sensing can be added to DBOS with negligible overhead. For
collaborative awareness, many DBOS instances were connected to a single DBOS
aggregator. The Python-GraphBLAS and OneSparse PostgreSQL implementations
scaled linearly up to 64 and 32 nodes respectively. These results suggest that
DBOS collaborative network awareness can be achieved with a negligible increase
in computing resources.

### [251] [RFSeek and Ye Shall Find](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10216)
*Noga H. Rotman,Tiago Ferreira,Hila Peleg,Mark Silberstein,Alexandra Silva*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: RFSeek is a tool that extracts visual summaries from network protocol specifications (RFCs). It uses large language models (LLMs) to create provenance-linked diagrams, making it easier to understand and audit RFC logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in understanding RFCs due to their lengthy, prose-based format, which often obscures precise operational details.

Method: RFSeek applies large language models to automatically extract protocol logic from RFCs and to generate interactive, explorable, provenance-linked diagrams.

Result: RFSeek reconstructs existing diagrams, uncovers logic missing from official diagrams, and creates entirely new visualization diagrams for complex RFCs. Use cases include knowledge extraction and semantic diffing.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs and user-customized visualizations offers a promising way to improve protocol comprehension and support accurate implementations of network protocols.

Abstract: Requests for Comments (RFCs) are extensive specification documents for
network protocols, but their prose-based format and their considerable length
often impede precise operational understanding. We present RFSeek, an
interactive tool that automatically extracts visual summaries of protocol logic
from RFCs. RFSeek leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate
provenance-linked, explorable diagrams, surfacing both official state machines
and additional logic found only in the RFC text. Compared to existing RFC
visualizations, RFSeek's visual summaries are more transparent and easier to
audit against their textual source. We showcase the tool's potential through a
series of use cases, including guided knowledge extraction and semantic
diffing, applied to protocols such as TCP, QUIC, PPTP, and DCCP.
  In practice, RFSeek not only reconstructs the RFC diagrams included in some
specifications, but, more interestingly, also uncovers important logic such as
nodes or edges described in the text but missing from those diagrams. RFSeek
further derives new visualization diagrams for complex RFCs, with QUIC as a
representative case. Our approach, which we term \emph{Summary Visualization},
highlights a promising direction: combining LLMs with formal, user-customized
visualizations to enhance protocol comprehension and support robust
implementations.

*Myles Joshua Toledo Tan,Maria Kapetanaki,Panayiotis V. Benos*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper presents an explainable machine learning model for classifying Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and its subtypes using spatial transcriptomics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the clinical challenge of differentiating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis subtypes of IBD, which share overlapping symptoms.

Method: A computational framework was proposed using spatial transcriptomics data and Non-negative Matrix Factorization to identify cellular niches. Features related to tissue pathology were engineered and used in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier.

Result: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.774 for the three-class classification problem (HC, UC, CD) and 0.916 for distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Model explainability highlighted how spatial disruptions and niche-gene signatures impact classification.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel diagnostic tool using spatial transcriptomics combined with machine learning that enhances IBD classification while offering insights into the distinct mechanisms of its subtypes.

Abstract: Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
(IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical
challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel
computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an
explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data
from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring
cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the
tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing
three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood
enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier
trained on these features achieved an accuracy of 0.774 +/- 0.161 for the more
challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and 0.916 +/- 0.118 in the
two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model
explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization
of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the
classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression
signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that
transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive
tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper
insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.

*Tianqi Qiao,Marie Maros*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Polyak, a novel adaptive step size for statistical estimation in high-dimensional settings, addressing limitations of the standard Polyak method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of the traditional Polyak's step size in high-dimensional statistical estimation problems.

Method: The authors propose Sparse Polyak, which adapts the step size using the restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant rather than the traditional Lipschitz smoothness constant.

Result: Sparse Polyak achieves better statistical precision and reduces iteration count, as shown through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Sparse Polyak is an effective solution for high-dimensional estimation by tailoring step size to problem-specific smoothness.

Abstract: We propose and study Sparse Polyak, a variant of Polyak's adaptive step size,
designed to solve high-dimensional statistical estimation problems where the
problem dimension is allowed to grow much faster than the sample size. In such
settings, the standard Polyak step size performs poorly, requiring an
increasing number of iterations to achieve optimal statistical precision-even
when, the problem remains well conditioned and/or the achievable precision
itself does not degrade with problem size. We trace this limitation to a
mismatch in how smoothness is measured: in high dimensions, it is no longer
effective to estimate the Lipschitz smoothness constant. Instead, it is more
appropriate to estimate the smoothness restricted to specific directions
relevant to the problem (restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant). Sparse
Polyak overcomes this issue by modifying the step size to estimate the
restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant. We support our approach with both
theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, demonstrating its improved
performance.

*Yixuan Sun,Srinivas Eswar,Yin Lin,William Detmold,Phiala Shanahan,Xiaoye Li,Yang Liu,Prasanna Balaprakash*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper addresses improving the efficiency of solving linear systems in lattice QCD through an operator learning-based preconditioning technique, reducing computational costs and iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving ill-conditioned Hermitian positive definite linear systems in lattice QCD is computationally expensive. Efficient preconditioners like multigrid are challenging to construct and may introduce more overhead, calling for a better approach.

Method: The authors propose an operator learning-based framework to construct preconditioners. These preconditioners do not rely on explicit matrices, facilitating efficient training and integration into the Conjugate Gradient solver.

Result: In the context of the Schwinger model in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, the proposed preconditioning significantly reduces the condition number and approximately halves the required solver iterations while demonstrating zero-shot learning for operators with different lattice sizes.

Conclusion: The new operator learning framework enhances solver efficiency effectively while showcasing flexibility with variations in lattice sizes, marking a significant advancement in preconditioning for lattice QCD problems.

Abstract: Linear systems arise in generating samples and in calculating observables in
lattice quantum chromodynamics~(QCD). Solving the Hermitian positive definite
systems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative
methods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and
computationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this
process, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However,
constructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional
computational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a
framework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as
effective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit
matrices from either the original linear systems or the produced
preconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG
solver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1
spacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning
scheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and
approximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in
relevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a
general mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot
learning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field
configurations of different sizes.

TL;DR: The study identifies attention heads in Whisper capturing precise word alignments, refining an unsupervised method to extract them without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate word-level timestamps are increasingly sought for applications using Whisper, but current methods lack competitiveness and rely on loose evaluation metrics.

Method: The paper identifies specific attention heads in Whisper that produce accurate word alignments, utilizes characters over wordpieces for precision, and proposes an unsupervised filtering method during teacher forcing.

Result: The proposed approach yields word alignments more accurate than previous work, achieving stricter tolerances of 20–100 ms without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: By exploiting attention head filtering and character-based alignment, the method enhances timestamp precision in Whisper without retraining, offering a viable alternative to prior approaches.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in obtaining accurate word-level timestamps
from strong automatic speech recognizers, in particular Whisper. Existing
approaches either require additional training or are simply not competitive.
The evaluation in prior work is also relatively loose, typically using a
tolerance of more than 200 ms. In this work, we discover attention heads in
Whisper that capture accurate word alignments and are distinctively different
from those that do not. Moreover, we find that using characters produces finer
and more accurate alignments than using wordpieces. Based on these findings, we
propose an unsupervised approach to extracting word alignments by filtering
attention heads while teacher forcing Whisper with characters. Our approach not
only does not require training but also produces word alignments that are more
accurate than prior work under a stricter tolerance between 20 ms and 100 ms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified, generic 2D convolutional front-end for feature extraction in ASR, which matches the performance of existing supervised methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many neural front-ends for ASR are influenced by classical methods and rely on various layer topologies, making them task-specific and complex.

Method: Proposes a unified, generic 2D convolutional front-end architecture for feature extraction, systematically reducing reliance on classical approaches.

Result: The proposed method is parameter-efficient, fits scenarios with limited computational resources, and performs on par with existing supervised feature extractors.

Conclusion: A generic 2D convolutional front-end for ASR is feasible, efficient, and provides competitive performance without relying on pre-trained models or task-specific designs.

Abstract: Neural front-ends represent a promising approach to feature extraction for
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as they enable to learn specifically
tailored features for different tasks. Yet, many of the existing techniques
remain heavily influenced by classical methods. While this inductive bias may
ease the system design, our work aims to develop a more generic front-end for
feature extraction. Furthermore, we seek to unify the front-end architecture
contrasting with existing approaches that apply a composition of several layer
topologies originating from different sources. The experiments systematically
show how to reduce the influence of existing techniques to achieve a generic
front-end. The resulting 2D convolutional front-end is parameter-efficient and
suitable for a scenario with limited computational resources unlike large
models pre-trained on unlabeled audio. The results demonstrate that this
generic unified approach is not only feasible but also matches the performance
of existing supervised learnable feature extractors.

TL;DR: This study focuses on meeting transcription, analyzing leakage in speech separation, and shows state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS when trained only on LibriSpeech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in meeting transcription performance prompt further analysis and improvement.

Method: A framework is extended to analyze leakage with sensitivity to temporal locality, exploring voice activity detection and comparing segmentation methods.

Result: Significant leakage occurs in areas with single speakers but minimally impacts performance due to VAD. Advanced diarization reduces segmentation gaps by a third compared to energy-based VAD.

Conclusion: Despite leakage, the transcription system achieves top performance on LibriCSS when restricted to LibriSpeech data training.

Abstract: Meeting transcription is a field of high relevance and remarkable progress in
recent years. Still, challenges remain that limit its performance. In this
work, we extend a previously proposed framework for analyzing leakage in speech
separation with proper sensitivity to temporal locality. We show that there is
significant leakage to the cross channel in areas where only the primary
speaker is active. At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not
affect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by
the voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are
compared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the
gap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD. We
additionally reveal what factors contribute to the remaining difference. The
results represent state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS among systems that
train the recognition module on LibriSpeech data only.

TL;DR: The paper improves sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by introducing off-policy Lyapunov functions and applying them to existing algorithms, enhancing stability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning traditionally lacks stability guarantees, and recent approaches using Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to on-policy learning.

Method: An off-policy Lyapunov function is introduced and integrated into Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms, enhancing stability and sample efficiency.

Result: Simulations with an inverted pendulum and quadrotor demonstrate improved performance of the algorithms equipped with the off-policy Lyapunov function.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the stability and data efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms, contributing to more reliable and robust control solutions.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability
guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the
control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned
Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This
paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and
incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor
Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data
efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a
quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when
endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.

Motivation: Tackling challenges in dynamic system control, such as handling unknown dynamics, unreachable setpoints, and measurement noise, while ensuring stability and feasibility.

Method: Developed DFMPC using physics-based models complemented by data-driven representations; incorporated Willems' Fundamental Lemma, artificial equilibrium, slack variables, and regularization techniques.

Result: DFMPC exhibited improved tracking performance and robustness when tested on the iRonCub humanoid robot, outperforming traditional model-based MPC in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances tracking, feasibility, and stability in dynamic systems, making it a promising tool for real-time robotics applications involving unknown dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework
that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown
dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium
formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable
setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables
and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and
practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of
reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid
robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine
dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a
purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

TL;DR: HYPOGENEAGENT utilizes a large language model (LLM) to optimize cluster annotation in single-cell studies, providing calibrated GO term hypotheses and resolution scores for improved alignment with biological pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clustering and annotation practices in single-cell and Perturb-seq studies are subjective and rely heavily on expert judgment, creating inconsistency and bias.

Method: The framework uses an LLM to generate ranked lists of Gene-Ontology hypotheses and confidence scores. It then evaluates intra-cluster agreement and inter-cluster separation using sentence embeddings and cosine similarities to optimize cluster resolution.

Result: Testing HYPOGENEAGENT on a K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset demonstrated its ability to select clustering granularities that better align with known biological pathways compared to classical metrics.

Conclusion: HYPOGENEAGENT represents an advancement towards automated and unbiased cluster resolution and annotation, addressing subjectivity in single-cell multi-omics analysis.

Abstract: Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve
clustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology
(GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both
stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently
subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present
HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming
cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM
functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or
perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses,
accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every
predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine
similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal
consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same
cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness,
low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two
quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is
maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity.
When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary
test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit
alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette
score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings
establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and
functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated,
context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving tensor PCA efficiency and reconciling a tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio and computational cost.

Method: Developing an algorithm that uses weighted hypergraph counting for solving the order-$p$ tensor PCA problem with better complexity scaling.

Result: The algorithm achieves success under a specified signal-to-noise ratio and runs faster by a poly-logarithmic factor compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm validates the conjecture regarding computational cost vs. signal-to-noise ratio tradeoff and improves tensor PCA methodology.

Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm for tensor PCA based on counting a specific
family of weighted hypergraphs. For the order-$p$ tensor PCA problem where $p
\geq 3$ is a fixed integer, we show that when the signal-to-noise ratio is
$\lambda n^{-\frac{p}{4}}$ where $\lambda=\Omega(1)$, our algorithm succeeds
and runs in time $n^{C+o(1)}$ where $C=C(\lambda)$ is a constant depending on
$\lambda$. This algorithm improves a poly-logarithmic factor compared to
previous algorithms based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy \cite{HSS15} or based
on the Kikuchi hierarchy in statistical physics \cite{WEM19}. Furthermore, our
result shows a smooth tradeoff between the signal-to-noise ratio and the
computational cost in this problem, thereby confirming a conjecture posed in
\cite{KWB22}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-field stochastic differential equations, such as McKean--Vlasov equations, are crucial for understanding complex dynamical systems across diverse domains, but their spectral properties are often underexplored.

Method: The paper introduces extended dynamic mode decomposition and Galerkin projection methodologies to approximate transfer operators, enabling finite-dimensional computations of spectral properties.

Result: The approach is demonstrated through examples like the Cormier model, Kuramoto model, and its three-dimensional generalization, revealing slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns and metastable sets.

Conclusion: This work offers a computational framework for spectral analysis of McKean--Vlasov equations, contributing to improved understanding of complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Mean-field stochastic differential equations, also called McKean--Vlasov
equations, are the limiting equations of interacting particle systems with
fully symmetric interaction potential. Such systems play an important role in a
variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics.
Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be
obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer
operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In
this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and
show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection
methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these
operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify
slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The
results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and
benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a
three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study examines the dynamics of openness in AI, integrating it into value chain analysis, and discusses how foundational AI influences downstream chains amidst industry power concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how openness in AI, such as open-source resources, interacts with the existing dominance of 'big tech' and whether it can facilitate technological transfer and reduce industry-power concentration.

Method: The authors conceptualize openness in AI as a form of interfirm relationship, applying value chain analysis to explore governance, control, and outsourcing dynamics in the AI sector.

Result: The study develops a framework linking foundational AI elements (like open models) with downstream value chains, providing insights into the capitalist dynamics and governance structures of the industry.

Conclusion: While remaining critical of the consolidation of power among leading AI firms, the work posits that openness in AI may foster technological advancements and spillovers through global competition for AI leadership.

Abstract: The rise of AI has been rapid, becoming a leading sector for investment and
promising disruptive impacts across the economy. Within the critical analysis
of the economic impacts, AI has been aligned to the critical literature on data
power and platform capitalism - further concentrating power and value capture
amongst a small number of "big tech" leaders.
  The equally rapid rise of openness in AI (here taken to be claims made by AI
firms about openness, "open source" and free provision) signals an interesting
development. It highlights an emerging ecosystem of open AI models, datasets
and toolchains, involving massive capital investment. It poses questions as to
whether open resources can support technological transfer and the ability for
catch-up, even in the face of AI industry power.
  This work seeks to add conceptual clarity to these debates by conceptualising
openness in AI as a unique type of interfirm relation and therefore amenable to
value chain analysis. This approach then allows consideration of the capitalist
dynamics of "outsourcing" of foundational firms in value chains, and
consequently the types of governance and control that might emerge downstream
as AI is adopted. This work, therefore, extends previous mapping of AI value
chains to build a framework which links foundational AI with downstream value
chains.
  Overall, this work extends our understanding of AI as a productive sector.
While the work remains critical of the power of leading AI firms, openness in
AI may lead to potential spillovers stemming from the intense competition for

### [265] [VStyle: A Benchmark for Voice Style Adaptation with Spoken Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09716)
*Jun Zhan,Mingyang Han,Yuxuan Xie,Chen Wang,Dong Zhang,Kexin Huang,Haoxiang Shi,DongXiao Wang,Tengtao Song,Qinyuan Cheng,Shimin Li,Jun Song,Xipeng Qiu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are being evaluated for their ability to adapt speaking styles based on spoken instructions, using the newly introduced VStyle benchmark and Voice Style Adaptation (VSA) task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLMs have focused on semantics and instruction following, but their ability to adjust speaking styles like timbre, prosody, or persona has been overlooked. The authors aim to explore this neglected aspect.

Method: They introduce the VStyle benchmark for bilingual (Chinese & English) evaluation across four speech generation categories and use the 'LALM as a Judge' evaluation framework to assess performance systematically.

Result: Experiments show that existing commercial and open-source models struggle with controllable speaking style adaptations, revealing the complexity of this task.

Conclusion: VStyle and its evaluation toolkit provide a starting point for advancing spoken language models in human-centered interaction by improving style adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech
understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction.
However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction
following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken
instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style
Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their
speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language
spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese &
English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic
attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We
also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge)
framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness,
style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective
assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate
that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation,
highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle
and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation
for advancing human centered spoken interaction. The dataset and code are
publicly available at

### [266] [Testing chatbots on the creation of encoders for audio conditioned image generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09717)
*Jorge E. León,Miguel Carrasco*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether conversational agents can design neural audio encoders to replace text encoders in image synthesis models, finding limited success in achieving alignment with the original text encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether conversational agents can effectively innovate by designing novel neural architectures for unique tasks such as audio-to-visual synthesis.

Method: State-of-the-art chatbots were prompted to propose audio encoder architectures under standardized conditions. Valid designs were trained on a dataset of over two million contextually related audio-image-text samples and evaluated using various metrics and qualitative analyses.

Result: All tested chatbots generated viable models, but none achieved satisfactory results. Among them, the Gemini audio encoder had the best quantitative metrics, while the Grok encoder delivered more coherent images.

Conclusion: Current conversational agents exhibit architectural biases, and their proposed solutions lack the ability to fully align audio embeddings with text embeddings in the context of image synthesis. Further research and more challenging tasks are necessary to test the creativity and reasoning of such agents.

Abstract: On one hand, recent advances in chatbots has led to a rising popularity in
using these models for coding tasks. On the other hand, modern generative image
models primarily rely on text encoders to translate semantic concepts into
visual representations, even when there is clear evidence that audio can be
employed as input as well. Given the previous, in this work, we explore whether
state-of-the-art conversational agents can design effective audio encoders to
replace the CLIP text encoder from Stable Diffusion 1.5, enabling image
synthesis directly from sound. We prompted five publicly available chatbots to
propose neural architectures to work as these audio encoders, with a set of
well-explained shared conditions. Each valid suggested encoder was trained on
over two million context related audio-image-text observations, and evaluated
on held-out validation and test sets using various metrics, together with a
qualitative analysis of their generated images. Although almost all chatbots
generated valid model designs, none achieved satisfactory results, indicating
that their audio embeddings failed to align reliably with those of the original
text encoder. Among the proposals, the Gemini audio encoder showed the best
quantitative metrics, while the Grok audio encoder produced more coherent
images (particularly, when paired with the text encoder). Our findings reveal a
shared architectural bias across chatbots and underscore the remaining coding
gap that needs to be bridged in future versions of these models. We also
created a public demo so everyone could study and try out these audio encoders.
Finally, we propose research questions that should be tackled in the future,
and encourage other researchers to perform more focused and highly specialized
tasks like this one, so the respective chatbots cannot make use of well-known
solutions and their creativity/reasoning is fully tested.

*Yixuan Gao,Tanvir Ahmed,Shuang He,Zhongqi Cheng,Rajalakshmi Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoilSound, a smartphone-based system for non-invasive and accessible soil moisture measurement using acoustic sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily accessible method for soil moisture monitoring that addresses the limitations of traditional techniques.

Method: SoilSound leverages smartphone speakers and microphones to send acoustic chirps into the soil, record reflections during a vertical scan, and process these signals using a convolutional neural network.

Result: The system achieves a mean absolute error of 2.39% in soil moisture estimation across 10 locations, demonstrating accuracy across various soil types and conditions without requiring calibration.

Conclusion: SoilSound provides a practical, accurate, and non-disruptive solution for soil moisture monitoring, making it suitable for widespread adoption in diverse settings by non-expert users.

Abstract: Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental
management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the
soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present
SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system
that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the
built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to
accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that
use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic
reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture
sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic
chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan,
which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for
on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or
power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes
in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a
mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the
evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels
ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and
users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling
widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen
scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.

### [268] [CoDiCodec: Unifying Continuous and Discrete Compressed Representations of Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09836)
*Marco Pasini,Stefan Lattner,George Fazekas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CoDiCodec is an audio autoencoder that combines continuous and discrete embeddings for efficient signal compression, demonstrating superior audio quality and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high compression ratios and maintaining audio fidelity, while bridging the gap between continuous and discrete embeddings in audio generative modeling.

Method: CoDiCodec uses Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), FSQ-dropout for training, and a single consistency loss term. It supports both autoregressive and parallel decoding strategies.

Result: CoDiCodec produces efficient compressed embeddings (~11 Hz continuous and 2.38 kbps discrete), achieving superior reconstruction audio quality compared to existing autoencoders.

Conclusion: CoDiCodec offers a unified approach to audio compression, combining the benefits of continuous and discrete generative modeling paradigms, with applications in various audio generation tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently representing audio signals in a compressed latent space is
critical for latent generative modelling. However, existing autoencoders often
force a choice between continuous embeddings and discrete tokens. Furthermore,
achieving high compression ratios while maintaining audio fidelity remains a
challenge. We introduce CoDiCodec, a novel audio autoencoder that overcomes
these limitations by both efficiently encoding global features via summary
embeddings, and by producing both compressed continuous embeddings at ~ 11 Hz
and discrete tokens at a rate of 2.38 kbps from the same trained model,
offering unprecedented flexibility for different downstream generative tasks.
This is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel
FSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the
single consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both
autoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter
achieving superior audio quality and faster decoding. CoDiCodec outperforms
existing continuous and discrete autoencoders at similar bitrates in terms of
reconstruction audio quality. Our work enables a unified approach to audio
compression, bridging the gap between continuous and discrete generative
modelling paradigms.

### [269] [Prototypical Contrastive Learning For Improved Few-Shot Audio Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10074)
*Christos Sgouropoulos,Christos Nikou,Stefanos Vlachos,Vasileios Theiou,Christos Foukanelis,Theodoros Giannakopoulos*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach integrating supervised contrastive loss and angular loss in few-shot audio classification, leveraging SpecAugment and self-attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MetaAudio benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning in audio classification is underexplored compared to the image domain, despite its importance for scenarios with limited labeled data.

Method: The paper combines supervised contrastive loss, angular loss, SpecAugment, and self-attention mechanisms to enhance few-shot audio classification.

Result: The method delivered state-of-the-art results in 5-way, 5-shot audio classification on the MetaAudio benchmark, outperforming previous models.

Conclusion: Integrating supervised contrastive loss, angular loss, and embedding diversity techniques enhances few-shot audio classification, establishing a robust model on the MetaAudio benchmark.

Abstract: Few-shot learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training models with
limited labeled data, addressing challenges in scenarios where large-scale
annotation is impractical. While extensive research has been conducted in the
image domain, few-shot learning in audio classification remains relatively
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating
supervised contrastive loss into prototypical few shot training for audio
classification. In detail, we demonstrate that angular loss further improves
the performance compared to the standard contrastive loss. Our method leverages
SpecAugment followed by a self-attention mechanism to encapsulate diverse
information of augmented input versions into one unified embedding. We evaluate
our approach on MetaAudio, a benchmark including five datasets with predefined
splits, standardized preprocessing, and a comprehensive set of few-shot
learning models for comparison. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance in a 5-way, 5-shot setting.

### [270] [Improving Audio Event Recognition with Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10391)
*Shanmuka Sadhu,Weiran Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of consistency regularization (CR) for audio event recognition using AudioSet and demonstrates its improvements over existing supervised and semi-supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness the benefits of consistency regularization, previously impactful in speech recognition, and assess its efficacy in audio event recognition, especially with varying training data sizes and semi-supervised setups.

Method: The method involves enforcing consistency between predictions on augmented views, performing ablation studies with small and large training datasets, employing stronger and multiple augmentations, and extending CR to semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Result: Consistency regularization improves supervised audio event recognition baselines, yields additional benefits with stronger augmentations for small datasets, and enhances performance in semi-supervised learning setups leveraging labeled and unlabeled samples.

Conclusion: Consistency regularization proves effective for audio event recognition, improving both supervised and semi-supervised models when properly implemented with augmentations and unlabeled data.

Abstract: Consistency regularization (CR), which enforces agreement between model
predictions on augmented views, has found recent benefits in automatic speech
recognition [1]. In this paper, we propose the use of consistency
regularization for audio event recognition, and demonstrate its effectiveness
on AudioSet. With extensive ablation studies for both small ($\sim$20k) and
large ($\sim$1.8M) supervised training sets, we show that CR brings consistent
improvement over supervised baselines which already heavily utilize data
augmentation, and CR using stronger augmentation and multiple augmentations
leads to additional gain for the small training set. Furthermore, we extend the
use of CR into the semi-supervised setup with 20K labeled samples and 1.8M
unlabeled samples, and obtain performance improvement over our best model
trained on the small set.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a machine learning competition using neonatal EEG data to classify brain abnormality severity, emphasizing the importance of robust data and validation for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited access to high-quality, annotated EEG data essential for developing robust machine learning models for monitoring brain function in at-risk newborns.

Method: The researchers compiled a retrospective multi-center EEG dataset from 102 newborns, created training, testing, and validation sets, hosted a web-based ML competition, and evaluated top-performing models using a held-out validation set.

Result: The feature-based model ranked highest on the testing dataset, but deep learning models showed better generalization on the validation sets. All methods exhibited performance drops when applied to unseen data.

Conclusion: The research highlights the necessity of large, diverse datasets and held-out validation for generalization, showcasing the potential of collaborative ML competitions to aid neonatal neuromonitoring advancements.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert
performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing
accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated
data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by
providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared
learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of
crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing
353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The
data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out
validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background
patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a
machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity
of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4
performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation
dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,
deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had
a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing
performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen
data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with
neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on
large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's
outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML
development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the
development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.

### [272] [FetalSleepNet: A Transfer Learning Framework with Spectral Equalisation Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10082)
*Weitao Tang,Johann Vargas-Calixto,Nasim Katebi,Nhi Tran,Sharmony B. Kelly,Gari D. Clifford,Robert Galinsky,Faezeh Marzbanrad*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces FetalSleepNet, a novel deep learning system for automated fetal sleep stage classification using EEG, enabling better detection of brain issues during pregnancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring fetal brain maturation is crucial for detecting complications like hypoxia or growth restrictions. Current methods are complex and labor-intensive, necessitating advancements in sleep stage classification.

Method: EEG data from fetal sheep were analyzed with domain adaptation and deep learning techniques. The approach involved transfer learning from adult EEG and a spectral equalization strategy to reduce mismatches across datasets.

Result: FetalSleepNet achieved a high accuracy of 86.6% and macro F1-score of 62.5, outperforming baseline models through the use of fine tuning and spectral equalization techniques.

Conclusion: FetalSleepNet is the first deep learning system dedicated to fetal EEG-based sleep staging. Its lightweight design supports real-time, low-power monitoring in clinical applications and opens up pathways for scalable semi-supervised training on other signals.

Abstract: Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep
learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine
electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and
laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage
classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation
associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth
restriction).
  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal
cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network
originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG
using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain
adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.
  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full
fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall
performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming
baseline models.
  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep
learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the
fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier
functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling
and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be
acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.
FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low
power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of efficiently synchronizing spintronic oscillators.

Method: The authors simulate spintronic oscillators using the macrospin Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation and train reinforcement learning agents to synchronize with a target frequency within a fixed number of steps.

Result: The study presents improvements in convergence rate and energy efficiency for synchronization tasks within the simulated environment.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively enhances STO synchronization performance while providing practical insights through simulations.

Abstract: We address the problem of automatic synchronisation of the spintronic
oscillator (STO) by means of reinforcement learning (RL). A numerical solution
of the macrospin Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is used to
simulate the STO and we train the two types of RL agents to synchronise with a
target frequency within a fixed number of steps. We explore modifications to
this base task and show an improvement in both convergence and energy
efficiency of the synchronisation that can be easily achieved in the simulated
environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in ensuring data is optimally and ethically usable for advanced AI/ML methods in biomedical research.

Method: Assessment of current metadata practices, providing guidelines, and identifying gaps to enhance AI-readiness for biomedical datasets.

Result: Outlined criteria and guidelines for AI-readiness and identified gaps in metadata practices for Bridge2AI Grand Challenges.

Conclusion: Findings and recommendations can be applied to new projects for improving metadata and AI-readiness efforts, both within and outside Bridge2AI.

Abstract: AI-readiness describes the degree to which data may be optimally and
ethically used for subsequent AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods, where
those methods may involve some combination of model training, data
classification, and ethical, explainable prediction. The Bridge2AI consortium
has defined the particular criteria a biomedical dataset may possess to render
it AI-ready: in brief, a dataset's readiness is related to its FAIRness,
provenance, degree of characterization, explainability, sustainability, and
computability, in addition to its accompaniment with documentation about
ethical data practices.
  To ensure AI-readiness and to clarify data structure and relationships within
Bridge2AI's Grand Challenges (GCs), particular types of metadata are necessary.
The GCs within the Bridge2AI initiative include four data-generating projects
focusing on generating AI/ML-ready datasets to tackle complex biomedical and
behavioral research problems. These projects develop standardized, multimodal
data, tools, and training resources to support AI integration, while addressing
ethical data practices. Examples include using voice as a biomarker, building
interpretable genomic tools, modeling disease trajectories with diverse
multimodal data, and mapping cellular and molecular health indicators across
the human body.
  This report assesses the state of metadata creation and standardization in
the Bridge2AI GCs, provides guidelines where required, and identifies gaps and
areas for improvement across the program. New projects, including those outside
the Bridge2AI consortium, would benefit from what we have learned about
creating metadata as part of efforts to promote AI readiness.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of generative AI-powered search engines on information retrieval, emphasizing the need for a new optimization paradigm called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rapid transformation from traditional search engines to generative AI-based ones, which significantly change information retrieval mechanisms and challenge existing SEO practices.

Method: The authors conducted large-scale, controlled experiments across various contexts, such as verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, to compare AI-powered search and traditional web search.

Result: The research found that AI search engines favor Earned media extensively over Brand-owned and Social content, unlike Google. Additionally, these engines vary in domain diversity, content freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to query phrasing.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a GEO agenda that includes actionable strategies for improving visibility in generative AI-based searches by optimizing content for machine understanding, bolstering authority via Earned media, and adopting specific strategies for different engines and languages.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for a high-quality conversational dataset to train generative recommendation models for music, spanning multimodal interactions and diverse scenarios.

Method: Multiple specialized LLMs simulate conversational roles with conditioned goals and multimodal elements like audio and images to generate synthetic conversational data.

Result: TalkPlayData 2 fulfilled its intended purpose, demonstrating efficacy in training generative music recommendation models in subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a gap in multimodal conversational research and is made openly accessible to advance related machine learning and recommendation systems.

Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational
music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In TalkPlayData 2
pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various
roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information,
and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener
LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each
conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal.
Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a
simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge
and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed
goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model
for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at

also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication
lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials.
To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both
the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by
relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience
applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise
and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science
through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven
development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG
components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers,
and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.

*Himanshu Thakur,Eshani Agrawal,Smruthi Mukund*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach using Large and Small Language Models (LLMs and SLMs) to simulate user behavior for recommendation systems, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in simulating accurate user behavior due to its complexity and stochastic nature, and previous methods of using LLMs have limitations in scalability, bias correction, and alignment with user-specific preferences.

Method: The approach combines frozen LLMs for robust textual user representations and fine-tuned SLMs to simulate cost-effective user agents. Additionally, low-rank adapters are trained for groups of users (personas) to balance scalability and performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that these user agents improve offline-to-real-world performance alignment in recommender systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is efficient, scalable, and has the potential to significantly improve the real-world applicability of recommendation models.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in developing accurate recommendation models is
simulating user behavior, mainly due to the complex and stochastic nature of
user interactions. Towards this, one promising line of work has been the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior. However, aligning
these general-purpose large pre-trained models with user preferences
necessitates: (i) effectively and continously parsing large-scale tabular
user-item interaction data, (ii) overcoming pre-training-induced inductive
biases to accurately learn user specific knowledge, and (iii) achieving the
former two at scale for millions of users. While most previous works have
focused on complex methods to prompt an LLM or fine-tune it on tabular
interaction datasets, our approach shifts the focus to extracting robust
textual user representations using a frozen LLM and simulating cost-effective,
resource-efficient user agents powered by fine-tuned Small Language Models
(SLMs). Further, we showcase a method for training multiple low-rank adapters
for groups of users or \textit{persona}, striking an optimal balance between
scalability and performance of user behavior agents. Our experiments provide
compelling empirical evidence of the efficacy of our methods, demonstrating
that user agents developed using our approach have the potential to bridge the
gap between offline metrics and real-world performance of recommender systems.

*Aleksandr Listopad*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, Wave-Based Semantic Memory, which uses wave patterns instead of conventional vector-based embeddings to enhance semantic similarity retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vector-based memory systems that fail to capture resonance phenomena and are phase-insensitive in knowledge representation.

Method: The framework models knowledge as wave patterns and uses resonance-based interference for retrieval. Amplitude and phase information is preserved, enabling a more expressive semantic similarity.

Result: The proposed system outperforms traditional vector methods in discriminative tasks like phase shifts, negations, and compositional queries. An implementation, ResonanceDB, scales efficiently to millions of patterns with millisecond latency.

Conclusion: Wave-based memory offers a more robust and expressive alternative for semantic retrieval, demonstrating scalability and promise for AGI-related reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Conventional vector-based memory systems rely on cosine or inner product
similarity within real-valued embedding spaces. While computationally
efficient, such approaches are inherently phase-insensitive and limited in
their ability to capture resonance phenomena crucial for meaning
representation. We propose Wave-Based Semantic Memory, a novel framework that
models knowledge as wave patterns $\psi(x) = A(x) e^{i\phi(x)}$ and retrieves
it through resonance-based interference. This approach preserves both amplitude
and phase information, enabling more expressive and robust semantic similarity.
We demonstrate that resonance-based retrieval achieves higher discriminative
power in cases where vector methods fail, including phase shifts, negations,
and compositional queries. Our implementation, ResonanceDB, shows scalability
to millions of patterns with millisecond latency, positioning wave-based memory
as a viable alternative to vector stores for AGI-oriented reasoning and
knowledge representation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified query understanding framework using a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve query interpretation, relevance, and scalability in dynamic web applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional query understanding methods use multiple task-specific models that are costly to maintain, slow to update, and brittle against changes in language and taxonomy.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework powered by an LLM that jointly processes user queries and contextual factors like profile attributes to produce structured interpretations for better personalization and recommendations.

Result: The proposed framework enhances relevance quality in online A/B testing while simultaneously reducing system complexity and operational costs.

Conclusion: This unified LLM-based approach offers a scalable, adaptable, and more accurate solution for modern query understanding in web applications.

Abstract: Query understanding is essential in modern relevance systems, where user
queries are often short, ambiguous, and highly context-dependent. Traditional
approaches often rely on multiple task-specific Named Entity Recognition models
to extract structured facets as seen in job search applications. However, this
fragmented architecture is brittle, expensive to maintain, and slow to adapt to
evolving taxonomies and language patterns. In this paper, we introduce a
unified query understanding framework powered by a Large Language Model (LLM),
designed to address these limitations. Our approach jointly models the user
query and contextual signals such as profile attributes to generate structured
interpretations that drive more accurate and personalized recommendations. The
framework improves relevance quality in online A/B testing while significantly
reducing system complexity and operational overhead. The results demonstrate
that our solution provides a scalable and adaptable foundation for query
understanding in dynamic web applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper leverages deletion diagnostics in recommendation systems to measure the influence of users or items on model performance, applying the approach to both neural and classical techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems enhance user experience and revenue but often sacrifice transparency, requiring techniques to quantify user or item influence on decisions.

Method: The study employs deletion diagnostics by training models without specific users/items and comparing performance, applying this method to Neural Collaborative Filtering and Singular Value Decomposition.

Result: Experiments conducted on MovieLens and Amazon Reviews datasets validate the model-agnostic feature of the approach and provide insights into recommender behavior.

Conclusion: The deletion diagnostics framework is effective for evaluating user/item influence regardless of the recommendation paradigm, enabling more transparent systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems often benefit from complex feature embeddings and deep
learning algorithms, which deliver sophisticated recommendations that enhance
user experience, engagement, and revenue. However, these methods frequently
reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research,
we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion
diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of
a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item,
allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either
positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the
proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used
deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a
classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and
Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the
generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.

Conclusion: Personalized DPPs prove effective for diversifying recommendations without drastically sacrificing relevance, and the paper provides actionable guidance and reproducible resources for implementation.

Abstract: While optimizing recommendation systems for user engagement is a
well-established practice, effectively diversifying recommendations without
negatively impacting core business metrics remains a significant industry
challenge. In line with our initiative to broaden our audience's cultural
practices, this study investigates using personalized Determinantal Point
Processes (DPPs) to sample diverse and relevant recommendations. We rely on a
well-known quality-diversity decomposition of the similarity kernel to give
more weight to user preferences. In this paper, we present our implementations

diversity through both offline and online metrics, and give insights for
practitioners on their use in a production environment. For the sake of
reproducibility, we release the full code for our platform and experiments on

### [287] [A Holistic Architecture for Monitoring and Optimization of Robust Multi-Agent Path Finding Plan Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10284)
*David Zahrádka,Denisa Mužíková,David Woller,Miroslav Kulich,Jiří Švancara,Roman Barták*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses handling delays during Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) executions by proposing a system to estimate execution time and decide when to replan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delays in robot execution during MAPF can cause inefficiencies and potential collisions, necessitating methods to ensure both safety and efficiency.

Method: A holistic architecture is proposed, utilizing Action Dependency Graphs to predict alternative plans for improved efficiency during MAPF executions.

Result: The architecture is shown to effectively predict when replanning is beneficial, using a real-time simulator for validation.

Conclusion: This framework enhances robust and efficient MAPF execution by dynamically adapting plans based on delays and predicted execution times.

Abstract: The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a
fleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their
goals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots
executing the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk.
Although robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the
presence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the
duration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become
significant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the
original plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan
which will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide
when to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this
paper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans,
its monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called
Action Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution
duration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the
potential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We
empirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator
which we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous
warehouse robotic fleet.

TL;DR: The paper explores an AI-assisted negotiation framework incorporating LLMs and autonomous agents to address complex, cross-sectoral challenges, with proof-of-concept tests showing potential in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional risk analysis frameworks that fail to tackle the complexity and interdependencies of cross-sectoral challenges, which hinder effective solutions.

Method: The study proposes an AI-assisted negotiation framework that integrates large language models and autonomous agents into a negotiation-centered risk analysis workflow, enabling simulation, dynamic modeling, and decision-making augmentation.

Result: Proof-of-concept implementations in biopesticide use and wild animal population control demonstrated the potential of the framework to improve negotiation outcomes and cross-sectoral engagement.

Conclusion: The framework provides an open-source, web-based solution suitable for broader audiences, addressing a critical tool gap, and allowing customization for diverse needs.

Abstract: Key global challenges of our times are characterized by complex
interdependencies and can only be effectively addressed through an integrated,
participatory effort. Conventional risk analysis frameworks often reduce
complexity to ensure manageability, creating silos that hinder comprehensive
solutions. A fundamental shift towards holistic strategies is essential to
enable effective negotiations between different sectors and to balance the
competing interests of stakeholders. However, achieving this balance is often
hindered by limited time, vast amounts of information, and the complexity of
integrating diverse perspectives. This study presents an AI-assisted
negotiation framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) and
AI-based autonomous agents into a negotiation-centered risk analysis workflow.
The framework enables stakeholders to simulate negotiations, systematically
model dynamics, anticipate compromises, and evaluate solution impacts. By
leveraging LLMs' semantic analysis capabilities we could mitigate information
overload and augment decision-making process under time constraints.
Proof-of-concept implementations were conducted in two real-world scenarios:
(i) prudent use of a biopesticide, and (ii) targeted wild animal population
control. Our work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted negotiation to
address the current lack of tools for cross-sectoral engagement. Importantly,
the solution's open source, web based design, suits for application by a
broader audience with limited resources and enables users to tailor and develop
it for their own needs.

### [289] [SmartCoder-R1: Towards Secure and Explainable Smart Contract Generation with Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09942)
*Lei Yu,Jingyuan Zhang,Xin Wang,Jiajia Ma,Li Yang,Fengjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmartCoder-R1, a model designed for secure and explainable smart contract generation using advanced training and fine-tuning methods. It outperformed existing models across multiple metrics, including vulnerability reduction and reasoning clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the risks associated with vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the inability of LLMs to produce secure code due to their 'black box' nature.

Method: The paper uses three key methods: Continual Pre-training (CPT) for specialization, Long Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) to simulate expert reasoning, and Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) to refine code generation for security and other criteria.

Result: SmartCoder-R1 surpasses 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 functions, significantly improving key metrics such as a FullRate of 50.53%, a 45.79% relative improvement over the previous best model, DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: SmartCoder-R1 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for generating secure and explainable smart contracts, combining enhanced security measures with improved human-evaluated functionality, security, and clarity.

Abstract: Smart contracts automate the management of high-value assets, where
vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic financial losses. This challenge is
amplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they
operate as unauditable "black boxes" lacking a transparent reasoning process,
and consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities.
To address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a
novel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins
with Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long
Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated
reasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security
analysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ
Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement
learning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted
reward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format
correctness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world
functions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top
performance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a
SafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This
FullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline,
DeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human
evaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security
(85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%).

Motivation: The motivation is to address Bitcoin's limitations in scripting and interoperability to integrate it effectively into decentralized finance and multi-chain ecosystems.

Method: The study proposes a taxonomy categorizing Bitcoin bridge designs into three types and evaluates their performance against metrics such as trust, latency, capital efficiency, and composability.

Result: The paper highlights emerging innovations like BitVM and recursive sidechains that offer scalable and programmable Bitcoin interoperability.

Conclusion: This taxonomy serves as a framework for developing secure and efficient cross-chain infrastructures, especially for AIoT scenarios.

Abstract: Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities and lack of native interoperability
mechanisms have constrained its integration into the broader blockchain
ecosystem, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) and multi-chain
applications. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Bitcoin
cross-chain bridge protocols, systematically analyzing their trust assumptions,
performance characteristics, and applicability to the Artificial Intelligence
of Things (AIoT) scenarios. We categorize bridge designs into three main types:
naive token swapping, pegged-asset bridges, and arbitrary-message bridges. Each
category is evaluated across key metrics such as trust model, latency, capital
efficiency, and DeFi composability. Emerging innovations like BitVM and
recursive sidechains are highlighted for their potential to enable secure,
scalable, and programmable Bitcoin interoperability. Furthermore, we explore
practical use cases of cross-chain bridges in AIoT applications, including
decentralized energy trading, healthcare data integration, and supply chain
automation. This taxonomy provides a foundational framework for researchers and
practitioners seeking to design secure and efficient cross-chain
infrastructures in AIoT systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and understand the security of large language models in the face of adversarial attacks.

Method: The study systematically tested the models Flan-T5, BERT, and RoBERTa-Base using adversarial attack methods like TextFooler and BERTAttack.

Result: RoBERTa-Base and Flan-T5 showed high resilience with 0% attack success rates, while BERT-Base was highly vulnerable, with TextFooler reducing its accuracy drastically.

Conclusion: Certain LLMs have robust defenses, though at a computational cost, and the study pushes for developing efficient and effective measures to ensure model security.

Abstract: This study evaluates the resilience of large language models (LLMs) against
adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on Flan-T5, BERT, and RoBERTa-Base.
Using systematically designed adversarial tests through TextFooler and
BERTAttack, we found significant variations in model robustness. RoBERTa-Base
and FlanT5 demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining accuracy even when
subjected to sophisticated attacks, with attack success rates of 0%. In
contrast. BERT-Base showed considerable vulnerability, with TextFooler
achieving a 93.75% success rate in reducing model accuracy from 48% to just 3%.
Our research reveals that while certain LLMs have developed effective defensive
mechanisms, these safeguards often require substantial computational resources.
This study contributes to the understanding of LLM security by identifying
existing strengths and weaknesses in current safeguarding approaches and
proposes practical recommendations for developing more efficient and effective
defensive strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Split Learning (SL) allows resource-constrained clients to train neural networks collaboratively, but faces backdoor attack vulnerabilities from malicious clients. ZORRO uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure integrity and defense on the client-side.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of preventing malicious clients in SL frameworks from manipulating the training process and injecting backdoors into shared neural networks.

Method: ZORRO, a defense scheme utilizing interactive zero-knowledge proofs, ensures computational integrity of client-side defense algorithms. It inspects locally trained DNN portions using frequency representation while maintaining low computational overhead.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness by reducing attack success rates to under 6% and incurs minimal computational overhead even for complex models, making it scalable and practical.

Conclusion: ZORRO introduces a robust client-side solution to mitigate backdoor attacks in SL setups while maintaining efficiency and scalability, ensuring secure collaborative learning environments.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning approach that enables
resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train deep neural networks
(DNNs) by offloading most layers to a central server while keeping in- and
output layers on the client-side. This setup enables SL to leverage server
computation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in
resource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the
distributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training
process. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors
into the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on
server-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A
significant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients
to correctly execute the defense algorithm.
  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme.
Through our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense
algorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the
benign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency
representation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth
inspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring
that each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our
extensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various
attack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it
reduces the attack success rate to less than 6\% while causing even for models
storing \numprint{1000000} parameters on the client-side an overhead of less
than 10 seconds.

Method: Three-phase methodology using structured prompts for firmware generation, automated security validation through fuzzing, static analysis, and runtime monitoring, and iterative refinements with feedback-informed patches.

Result: The methodology achieved a 92.4% Vulnerability Remediation Rate (37.3% improvement), 95.8% Threat Model Compliance, and a 0.87 Security Coverage Index, alongside real-time performance metrics like 8.6ms execution time and 195µs jitter.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves both cybersecurity and operational performance of firmware while providing valuable resources for future research, like an open-source dataset.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in generating firmware for embedded
systems, but often introduce security flaws and fail to meet real-time
performance constraints. This paper proposes a three-phase methodology that
combines LLM-based firmware generation with automated security validation and
iterative refinement in a virtualized environment. Using structured prompts,
models like GPT-4 generate firmware for networking and control tasks, deployed
on FreeRTOS via QEMU. These implementations are tested using fuzzing, static
analysis, and runtime monitoring to detect vulnerabilities such as buffer
overflows (CWE-120), race conditions (CWE-362), and denial-of-service threats
(CWE-400). Specialized AI agents for Threat Detection, Performance
Optimization, and Compliance Verification collaborate to improve detection and
remediation. Identified issues are categorized using CWE, then used to prompt
targeted LLM-generated patches in an iterative loop. Experiments show a 92.4\%
Vulnerability Remediation Rate (37.3\% improvement), 95.8\% Threat Model
Compliance, and 0.87 Security Coverage Index. Real-time metrics include 8.6ms
worst-case execution time and 195{\mu}s jitter. This process enhances firmware
security and performance while contributing an open-source dataset for future
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With 5G networks being critical, reliable incident response to security threats necessitates interpretable machine learning (ML) models for actionable decisions.

Method: The authors evaluated SHAP and VoTE-XAI methods using interpretations from an XGBoost model across three 5G attack use cases, analyzing metrics like sparsity, stability, and efficiency.

Result: VoTE-XAI provided concise (6 important features vs. over 20 by SHAP), stable, and faster explanations (<0.002 seconds) in comparison to SHAP, though SHAP did not miss any features deemed important by VoTE-XAI.

Conclusion: VoTE-XAI delivers more efficient and stable explanations than SHAP, making it suitable for high-dimensional settings in 5G security contexts.

Abstract: With the rise of fifth-generation (5G) networks in critical applications, it
is urgent to move from detection of malicious activity to systems capable of
providing a reliable verdict suitable for mitigation. In this regard,
understanding and interpreting machine learning (ML) models' security alerts is
crucial for enabling actionable incident response orchestration. Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are expected to enhance trust by
providing insights into why alerts are raised. A dominant approach
statistically associates feature sets that can be correlated to a given alert.
This paper starts by questioning whether such attribution is relevant for
future generation communication systems, and investigates its merits in
comparison with an approach based on logical explanations. We extensively study
two methods, SHAP and VoTE-XAI, by analyzing their interpretations of alerts
generated by an XGBoost model in three different use cases with several 5G
communication attacks. We identify three metrics for assessing explanations:
sparsity, how concise they are; stability, how consistent they are across
samples from the same attack type; and efficiency, how fast an explanation is
generated. As an example, in a 5G network with 92 features, 6 were deemed
important by VoTE-XAI for a Denial of Service (DoS) variant, ICMPFlood, while
SHAP identified over 20. More importantly, we found a significant divergence
between features selected by SHAP and VoTE-XAI. However, none of the top-ranked
features selected by SHAP were missed by VoTE-XAI. When it comes to efficiency
of providing interpretations, we found that VoTE-XAI is significantly more
responsive, e.g. it provides a single explanation in under 0.002 seconds, in a
high-dimensional setting (478 features).

### [296] [Vibe Check: Understanding the Effects of LLM-Based Conversational Agents' Personality and Alignment on User Perceptions in Goal-Oriented Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09870)
*Hasibur Rahman,Smit Desai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explored how varying levels of personality expression in conversational agents (CAs) and user-agent personality compatibility impact user perceptions during goal-driven tasks, finding moderate expression and alignment yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the expression of personality in LLM-based conversational agents and alignment with user personality influences user evaluations and interactions, especially as CAs become more widespread.

Method: A between-subjects experiment involving 150 participants was conducted, using conversational agents with varying levels of Big Five traits controlled by the Trait Modulation Keys framework to study their impact on perceptions.

Result: Medium personality expression levels were evaluated most positively across metrics like Intelligence, Enjoyment, and Trust. Personality alignment amplified positive outcomes, with Extraversion and Emotional Stability being key traits.

Conclusion: Optimal design of CA personalities should focus on moderate expression levels and align traits strategically to improve user interaction outcomes; these are foundational recommendations as CA use increases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable conversational agents (CAs) to express
distinctive personalities, raising new questions about how such designs shape
user perceptions. This study investigates how personality expression levels and
user-agent personality alignment influence perceptions in goal-oriented tasks.
In a between-subjects experiment (N=150), participants completed travel
planning with CAs exhibiting low, medium, or high expression across the Big
Five traits, controlled via our novel Trait Modulation Keys framework. Results
revealed an inverted-U relationship: medium expression produced the most
positive evaluations across Intelligence, Enjoyment, Anthropomorphism,
Intention to Adopt, Trust, and Likeability, significantly outperforming both
extremes. Personality alignment further enhanced outcomes, with Extraversion
and Emotional Stability emerging as the most influential traits. Cluster
analysis identified three distinct compatibility profiles, with "Well-Aligned"
users reporting substantially positive perceptions. These findings demonstrate
that personality expression and strategic trait alignment constitute optimal
design targets for CA personality, offering design implications as LLM-based
CAs become increasingly prevalent.
