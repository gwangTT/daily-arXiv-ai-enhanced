### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for post-hoc explainability in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) and highlights improved evaluation methods to advance reproducibility and usability across studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on post-hoc explainability for KGC lacks formalization, consistent evaluations, and reproducibility, making cross-study comparisons difficult.

Method: A general framework is introduced to balance effectiveness and conciseness in post-hoc explanations using multi-objective optimization. The authors also suggest refined evaluation protocols using standard metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$.

Result: The proposed framework unifies existing algorithms and methods, while improved evaluation protocols are empirically supported to better assess explainability in KGC research.

Conclusion: This study enhances research in KGC post-hoc explainability by unifying approaches, setting clearer evaluation standards, and emphasizing interpretability to provide meaningful insights for end-users.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles can be used in leadership-scale datasets for training foundation models across domains like climate, nuclear fusion, health, and materials. It presents a conceptual framework for scientific data readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address challenges in preparing scientific datasets for scalable AI model training, ensuring reproducibility and cross-domain support in high performance computing (HPC) environments.

Method: The authors analyze workflows in four scientific domains and propose a readiness framework with two dimensions: Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard).

Result: A maturity matrix is developed to assess scientific data readiness and offer guidelines for creating standardized, cross-domain infrastructure.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework to facilitate scalable AI applications in science, focusing on transformer-based generative models and HPC constraints.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates strategies to balance reasoning accuracy and bias mitigation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how advanced techniques for improving reasoning in MLLMs interact with or trade off against bias mitigation.

Method: The authors benchmark three bias mitigation techniques (supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, and rule-based reinforcement learning) and explore different data sample mixes to study the trade-off.

Result: They identify that a mix of 1:4 debias-focused to reasoning-centric samples trained via reinforcement learning reduces stereotypes by 10% while maintaining 88% reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: A balanced approach between fairness and capability in MLLMs can be achieved with the identified training mix, offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI systems show catastrophic failures in auditory tasks humans excel at. A benchmark test reveals a high failure rate among models like GPT-4 Audio and Whisper, exposing gaps in auditory scene analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the stark performance gap between humans and AI in auditory tasks, uncover reasons behind the failures, and establish a diagnostic framework.

Method: Creation of an auditory Turing test with 917 challenges across categories like speech in noise, temporal distortion, and perceptual illusions. Evaluated state-of-the-art audio models.

Result: AI systems exhibited over a 93% failure rate with the best model achieving just 6.9% accuracy, compared to humans achieving 52% success.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack critical mechanisms for effective auditory scene analysis. The work calls for integrating selective attention, physics-based audio processing, and context awareness in AI development.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a property called 'argumentative coherence,' which ensures forecasters' reasoning aligns with their predictions. Testing this with humans and LLMs shows filtering incoherent forecasts enhances accuracy, and users generally don’t naturally apply the concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to improve judgmental forecasting by evaluating the argumentative reasoning behind forecasts, especially in human and AI contexts.

Method: Researchers formally define 'argumentative coherence' and assess its effect through analyses of human and LLM-based forecasts, followed by crowd-sourced experiments evaluating user alignment with the coherence concept.

Result: Removing incoherent forecast reasoning improves prediction accuracy and reveals a disconnect between users' intuitive reasoning and the proposed coherence property.

Conclusion: Incorporating mechanisms to filter incoherent opinions within judgmental forecasting frameworks could enhance prediction outcomes and reliability.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the complexity of computing Shapley-value-based responsibility scores for ontology-mediated query answering, highlighting polynomial data complexity in certain cases and intractability in others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to quantify the contributions of facts to query answers, using responsibility measures in ontology-mediated queries (OMQs), with a focus on computational tractability.

Method: The research builds on Shapley-value-based responsibility measures and evaluates their computational complexity within the context of ontology-mediated queries. The authors use prior database results, complexity analysis, and case studies involving different ontology languages.

Result: The study finds polynomial data complexity for ontology-mediated queries that are first-order-rewritable, but observes shP-hardness for languages encoding reachability queries. For combined complexity, even atomic queries become intractable with certain ontology features. Positive results include identifying tractable cases in specific DL-Lite dialects with structural restrictions.

Conclusion: This research investigates the computational boundaries of responsibility measures in ontology-mediated query answering, offering insights into when tractable computation is feasible and when it becomes computationally hard.

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a divide-and-conquer approach using partial MILP calls, focusing on selecting critical ReLUs via a novel scoring method (SAS) to improve verification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of previous methods that relied on costly and suboptimal binary variable usage for verifying neural networks.

Method: The authors developed a solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) system and adapted existing BaB branching functions for global scoring. The approach combines $
 \alpha, \beta$-CROWN with a short timeout and partial MILP calls.

Result: The SAS method reduces binary variable usage by 6 times compared to prior methods while maintaining accuracy. When applied via Hybrid MILP, it decreases undecided instances by up to 40% while keeping runtime reasonable.

Conclusion: The proposed solution-aware scoring significantly enhances verification accuracy and efficiency for large-scale CNNs, making the verification process faster and more scalable.

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

### [9] [AI Must not be Fully Autonomous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23330)
*Tosin Adewumi,Lama Alkhaled,Florent Imbert,Hui Han,Nudrat Habib,Karl Löwenmark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper classifies autonomous AI into 3 levels, arguing against fully autonomous (level 3) AI due to risks, and presents extensive evidence and arguments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential risks and challenges surrounding the development of fully autonomous AI (AI that can form its own objectives).

Method: The authors categorize AI autonomy into 3 levels, analyze related theories, and deliberate on the risks and necessity of human oversight. They also provide arguments, counterarguments, and supporting evidence.

Result: The paper identifies level 3 AI (full autonomy) as inherently risky, stresses the importance of human oversight, and supports its stance with 12 arguments, rebuttals to 6 counterarguments, and 15 examples of current AI issues.

Conclusion: Fully autonomous AI poses significant risks, and human oversight is crucial to ensure responsible AI development.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of systematic benchmarks for evaluating specialized data science agents developed from advances in LLMs.

Method: The study evaluates three LLMs—Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini—using three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and SmolAgent. It also explores model behavior under different task types, ambiguous prompts, and temperature parameter adjustments.

Result: The findings reveal performance differences among models and approaches, with the benchmark stressing various factors that influence practical deployment.

Conclusion: The benchmark and dataset proposed in this work aim to guide the creation of more robust and effective data science agents in the future.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail demonstrates the potential of LLMs in delivering tailored and efficient railway services, setting new standards for passenger experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

### [13] [Self-Foveate: Enhancing Diversity and Difficulty of Synthesized Instructions from Unsupervised Text via Multi-Level Foveation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23440)
*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Foveate, an LLM-driven method to improve instruction synthesis by enhancing diversity and difficulty through a Micro-Scatter-Macro methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for synthesizing instructional data rely on human annotation or automated paradigms, which lack adequate diversity and complexity.

Method: The Self-Foveate method uses a Micro-Scatter-Macro multi-level foveation strategy, guiding LLMs to extract detailed and fine-grained information from unsupervised text.

Result: Experiments across various unsupervised corpora and architectures demonstrate improved diversity and difficulty in synthesized instructions using Self-Foveate.

Conclusion: Self-Foveate is an effective and superior method for synthesizing instructional data, advancing the capabilities of LLMs through enhanced methodology and public data/code availability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

### [14] [Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23488)
*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how reasoning-focused architectures in language models perform on causal discovery tasks and demonstrates improvements using a structured in-context reasoning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in causal inference for large language models, particularly overcoming limitations like overfitting and instability under data perturbations.

Method: The authors evaluate reasoning-first language model architectures on the Corr2Cause benchmark, implement a modular in-context pipeline inspired by Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts approaches, and analyze model performance across reasoning complexity.

Result: Reasoning-focused models achieve significantly better performance over conventional methods, with the introduced in-context pipeline yielding nearly threefold improvements in causal discovery tasks.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models paired with carefully designed in-context reasoning frameworks demonstrate substantial progress in causal discovery and provide a general strategy for tackling such tasks in varied settings.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: Existing image classifier explanation methods either lack formal rigor or depend on strict assumptions about model structure, limiting their applicability.

Method: The authors developed causal and contrastive causal explanations, formally defining them while augmenting explanations with confidence awareness to achieve complete causal explanations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that different image classification models exhibit distinct patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness. Explanations are computed in about 6 seconds per image on ResNet50 using completely black-box methods.

Conclusion: Causal explanations combine formal rigor with practical feasibility and are a natural fit for image classifiers, offering a robust, efficient, and model-agnostic approach to explaining classifier outputs.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [16] [DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23554)
*Ruoyu Wang,Junda Wu,Yu Xia,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICE, a dynamic framework for selecting in-context examples in LLM-based agents, improving reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) in language models is prone to performance degradation due to poorly selected demonstrations. Current methodologies either depend on heuristics or task-specific criteria, lacking universality and theoretical grounding for demonstration selection.

Method: The authors propose DICE, a principled framework that decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components via causal analysis. It uses a stepwise selection criterion to identify impactful examples, requiring no additional training and integrating easily into existing frameworks.

Result: DICE achieves improved agent performance consistently across diverse reasoning tasks. The framework was validated through extensive experiments, proving its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: DICE demonstrates the importance of a theoretically grounded, context-aware methodology for demo selection, offering a robust, general-purpose solution for enhancing the performance of LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

### [17] [Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize trust evaluations in distributed collaborative systems by using agentic AI and hypergraph techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in trust evaluations in collaborative systems, which are hindered by resource limitations and complex dynamics.

Method: The method involves agentic AI for task-specific trust evaluation and hypergraphs to model trust relationships and reduce overhead.

Result: The proposed method enables efficient and accurate trust evaluations, balancing resource use and accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach improves trust management in collaborative systems, offering scalable and resource-efficient solutions.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [18] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new strategy-guided method for agent-assisted memory recall by transforming queries into cue-rich prompts using a Recall Router framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in agent-assisted memory recall are hindered by limited memory module sizes, impacting recall performance. Memory theories suggest that using effective cues can activate relevant memories.

Method: The authors developed a 5W Recall Map for memory query classification, defined strategies for recall scenarios, and used a hierarchical recall tree with Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimizing strategies. They fine-tuned large language models to create MemoCue.

Result: MemoCue consistently outperformed LLM-based methods by 17.74% in inspiring recall across datasets and showed superior performance in human evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy-guided method improves memory recall by leveraging cues derived from defined strategies and optimizing responses specifically tailored for diverse memory scenarios, demonstrating promising applications in practice.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR) to enhance personalized question recommendation for students by improving exploration efficiency in reinforcement learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for personalized question recommendation struggle with efficiently exploring and identifying the best questions for individual students during training.

Method: The authors propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which integrates collaborative ideas into the exploration process to enhance efficiency within limited training episodes.

Result: RAR significantly boosts recommendation performance, as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The RAR framework improves exploration efficiency in RL-based question recommendation systems and is adaptable to other RL-based approaches, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

TL;DR: TextQuests introduces a benchmark using interactive fiction games to evaluate AI agents' capabilities in reasoning over long horizons and exploratory contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to evaluate AI agents' ability to autonomously reason and operate in exploratory environments with long and growing contexts.

Method: TextQuests utilizes the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games as an evaluation framework, testing agents' intrinsic long-context reasoning and problem-solving capabilities without external tools.

Result: The benchmark assesses LLM agents in performing trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving in complex interactive environments.

Conclusion: TextQuests serves as a focused proxy for evaluating AI agents' autonomous problem-solving abilities, contributing to advancements in intrinsic agent reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a system called Seed-Prover for advanced mathematical theorem proving using a lemma-style approach and formal verification in Lean, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have difficulty in theorem proving due to insufficient supervision signals when solely using natural language. Formal languages like Lean can enable clear supervision through formal proof verification.

Method: The authors introduce Seed-Prover, a proof reasoning model that iteratively refines proofs using feedback from Lean, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. They also propose test-time inference strategies for deeper problem solving and create Seed-Geometry for handling geometry-related proofs.

Result: Seed-Prover achieves 78.1% success on IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F benchmarks, and outperforms state-of-the-art models on PutnamBench. Seed-Geometry surpasses existing geometry reasoning systems, helping to prove 5 out of 6 IMO 2025 problems.

Conclusion: The work illustrates that combining formal verification and chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improves automated theorem proving and sets a new benchmark for advanced mathematical reasoning systems.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generation of high-quality synthetic prompts that enhance the performance of LLMs in reasoning and instruction-following tasks.

Method: A synthetic data generation method that utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning for generating new prompts, followed by automatic filtering based on quality metrics.

Result: The synthetic data outperforms existing datasets in reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH500, AMC23) and improves instruction-following tasks compared to human and standard prompts.

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct demonstrates promising results in advancing LLM training and task performance through high-quality synthetic data generation.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0
and Arena-Hard.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture leveraging large language models (LLMs) for more generalized, simulation-based agent reasoning, solving complex tasks like web browsing with higher success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents based on LLMs often follow a one-task-one-agent model, which lacks scalability, generality, and suffers from the limitations of autoregressive LLMs. The authors aim to create a more general and capable AI agent with human-like simulation-based reasoning.

Method: SimuRA employs a world model implemented using LLMs to enable simulation-based planning, achieving flexible reasoning across diverse environments. The architecture relies on a concept-rich latent space of natural language for achieving goal-oriented actions.

Result: SimuRA significantly improves task success rates, notably increasing flight search success from 0% to 32.2%. The world model-based planning approach demonstrates a consistent performance advantage over autoregressive methods, with improvements up to 124%.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate the feasibility of a single, general agent model capable of excelling in diverse environments using LLMs for world-model-based planning. SimuRA's success establishes a foundation for developing superintelligent, generalized AI agents.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a case study about integrating LLMs into a booking platform to improve accommodation data consistency and reliability. Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B in data quality but had higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of incomplete or inconsistent accommodation data on online booking platforms, which frustrates users and affects business outcomes.

Method: The study integrates and evaluates two LLM models, Mistral 7B (fine-tuned with QLoRA) and Mixtral 8x7B (using a refined system prompt), based on their data-generation performance in an industrial setting.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B achieved better completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision (98.8% vs. 96%), and lower hallucination rates (1.2% vs. 4%) compared to Mistral 7B, though it required much higher computational resources.

Conclusion: The research highlights trade-offs between LLM quality and computational efficiency, providing guidance for choosing suitable models for production environments to enhance data consistency in property booking platforms.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems managing electric power customer service lack responsiveness and accuracy, while general LLMs lack domain expertise and empathy.

Method: ElectriQ provides a benchmark with a dialogue dataset of six service categories and evaluates LLMs using metrics like professionalism, readability, and user-friendliness. Additionally, a domain-specific knowledge base and knowledge augmentation method are introduced.

Result: Fine-tuned and augmented smaller models like LLama3-8B outperformed GPT-4o in professionalism and user-friendliness during experiments on 13 LLMs.

Conclusion: ElectriQ offers a robust framework for tailoring LLMs to meet the specific needs of electric power marketing services through domain specialization and targeted augmentation.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical classification framework using fine-tuned language models and a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illegal marketplace content across platforms like the dark web, Telegram, and Reddit. Their model outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, F1-score, and other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of detecting and categorizing illicit marketplace content due to issues like limited labeled data, evolving terminology, and the heterogeneity of online sources.

Method: The method involves a two-stage classification pipeline: Stage 1 uses a semi-supervised ensemble (XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM) to detect sales-related documents. Stage 2 classifies these into drugs, weapons, or credentials categories. The model is enhanced with ModernBERT for long documents and features like metadata and embedded patterns.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baselines like BERT, ModernBERT, and others, achieving an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388 in experiments on three datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, robust, and generalizes well for real-world illicit content detection, overcoming challenges like limited supervision and evolving jargon.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a hybrid framework combining machine learning (ML) models and large language models (LLMs) for subject analysis to improve term prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject analysis in libraries is necessary for effective resource management, but existing tools struggle with unseen cases and errors such as over-generation and hallucination from LLMs.

Method: The framework integrates embedding-based ML models to guide LLM term predictions with a controlled number of labels and applies post-editing using standardized terms.

Result: Experiments using Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) demonstrate improved accuracy and controlled vocabulary alignment compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid model enhances subject term prediction by leveraging both ML and LLMs, addressing hallucination issues and optimizing the output for library systems.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [28] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve Knowledge Graph (KG) integration by addressing the underexplored area of context matching through label and triple matching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world Knowledge Graphs exhibit diverse and complex contexts, which are often overlooked in current evaluation methods, creating a gap in entity matching research.

Method: The method employs label matching techniques like string manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity, along with triple matching to improve entity-matching accuracy in KG integration.

Result: The proposed approach performs competitively, achieving high accuracy in various test cases compared to leading systems and supervised methods. A new benchmark dataset was also introduced.

Conclusion: Integrating context into KG matching methods enhances accuracy and showcases the importance of addressing this neglected aspect in KG research.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

### [29] [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22915)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the issue of hallucination in large language models, providing theoretical groundwork and practical strategies for its detection, mitigation, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucination in LLMs is critical because it undermines their reliability and adherence to real-world facts.

Method: The authors differentiate types of hallucination, define hallucination risk, analyze theoretical bounds using PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity, and propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow.

Result: They surveyed detection strategies and proposed solutions like retrieval-augmented generation and fact-verification modules, along with evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical framework and practical guidelines to address hallucination in LLMs effectively, combining detection, mitigation, and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [30] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for handling longitudinal queries by incorporating temporal logic into the retrieval process. This shows significant improvements in query accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with handling temporal queries, as conventional semantic-driven retrieval methods fail to gather evidence that is both relevant and coherent across specified time durations.

Method: The paper proposes a redesigned RAG pipeline that segments user queries into subject and temporal window, utilizes a specialized retriever to calibrate semantic with temporal relevance, and introduces a new benchmark database, ADQAB, for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on the ADQAB benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with the redesigned RAG framework outperforming standard implementations by 13% to 27% in answer accuracy.

Conclusion: The study validates its approach as a solid enhancement for RAG systems, enabling them to handle complex diachronic (time-evolutionary) queries with greater precision in real-world applications.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

*Daniel Son,Sanjana Rathore,Andrew Rufail,Adrian Simon,Daniel Zhang,Soham Dave,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores feature universality in Gemma-2 language models across different scales, finding similar internal concepts despite differing model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models of different scales develop comparable internal representations, enhancing interpretability across models.

Method: Sparse autoencoders are applied to residual-stream activations, features are aligned via activation correlation, and the feature spaces are compared using SVCCA and RSA.

Result: Middle layers show the most similarity in monosemantic features, while early and late layers show less overlap. Semantically similar subspaces are found to interact similarly with the models.

Conclusion: Large language models develop broadly universal and interpretable features across scales, supporting their compatibility for cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [32] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper outlines methods for predicting serious adverse events (SAEs) in clinical trials using pre-registration data, leveraging advanced language models and feature extraction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical trial design by predicting safety outcomes accurately, minimizing risks to participants and avoiding trial terminations.

Method: The research employed transfer learning with pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT), combined with downstream prediction models. A sliding window approach was developed to handle embedding extraction for long trial texts.

Result: ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP emerged as the best model, with 77.6% AUC for SAE rate prediction and 18.6% RMSE for predicting SAE proportion in control arms. Sliding window techniques improved performance across classifiers and regressors.

Conclusion: Pre-registration data in ClinicalTrials.gov can be leveraged more effectively to estimate trial results, enhancing design and identifying discrepancies between predicted and actual safety outcomes.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy on discrete tokenization methods with vector quantization (VQ) for large language models (LLMs), analyzing their effectiveness and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing need for transforming continuous multimodal data into discrete representations for LLMs and to fill the lack of a systematic survey on vector quantization techniques for such systems.

Method: The authors categorize 8 representative VQ methods, analyzing their principles, training dynamics, and integration into LLM pipelines, while also discussing their impacts on single/multimodal systems and performance aspects like alignment and reasoning.

Result: The survey identifies key issues like codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints, and emphasizes emerging directions such as dynamic quantization and unified tokenization frameworks.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between traditional VQ and LLM applications, offering a foundational reference to improve and generalize multimodal systems leveraging tokenization.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [34] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to improve prediction accuracy and reduce hallucinations in language models by using a multi-stage cascade approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models are resource-intensive and often produce hallucinated (nonexistent) information, leading to inefficiencies, especially when the output is incorrect.

Method: The proposed LMC algorithm ensures correctness by validating language model outputs against a set of candidate answers and escalating incorrect responses to slower, more predictive models in a cascade setup.

Result: When extracting patient dates of birth from medical documents, the LMC algorithm improved both prediction speed and accuracy while significantly reducing hallucinated responses.

Conclusion: The LMC algorithm is a substantial contribution to the field of knowledge extraction and warrants further exploration to unlock its full potential.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

### [35] [Predicting stock prices with ChatGPT-annotated Reddit sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22922)
*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates whether social media sentiment, particularly on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, can predict stock market movements. Findings reveal weak correlation between sentiment and stock prices, but simpler metrics like comment volume and Google trends show stronger predictive potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if sentiment from social media discussions, as seen in events like the GameStop short squeeze, can serve as a predictor for stock market behavior.

Method: The study uses two existing sentiment analysis tools and introduces a ChatGPT-annotated, fine-tuned RoBERTa model to analyze Reddit discussions on GameStop and AMC. It assesses predictive power via correlation and causality metrics.

Result: The findings indicate social media sentiment has limited predictive power for stock prices, while simpler indicators like comment volume and Google search trends were more strongly correlated with stock movements.

Conclusion: Social media sentiment alone does not significantly predict stock price changes. The results suggest the need for better analytical methods or an inclusion of broader factors to fully understand retail investor behaviors.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

*Aman Gupta,Yingying Zhuang,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of different prompt translation strategies for multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance disparity among languages and improve knowledge sharing in multilingual RAG-based systems where retrieved knowledge from high-resource languages (e.g., English) is used for low-resource ones.

Method: Conducted systematic evaluation of classification tasks using varied prompt translation strategies (mono-lingual and cross-lingual) in RAG-enhanced LLMs.

Result: Optimized prompting strategies demonstrated significant improvement in sharing knowledge and classification task performance across languages.

Conclusion: Multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization are crucial for enhancing performance, particularly for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how native vs. non-native English speaker status impacts peer feedback sentiment and ratings in online computing courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language background influences peer feedback experiences in U.S.-based online computing courses, especially given the rise of non-native English speaking international students.

Method: Sentiment analysis of peer reviews from 500 students, using a Twitter-roBERTa-based model, and comparing feedback ratings by language background while controlling for sex and age.

Result: Native English speakers rate feedback less favorably. Non-native speakers write more positive reviews but receive less positive sentiment in return. Language background shows modest but complex effects when controlling for variables.

Conclusion: Language background influences both the tone of peer feedback and how feedback is perceived, highlighting subtle challenges for non-native speakers in online graduate-level computing education.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents to improve long-term memory organization and retrieval, achieving superior performance in dialogue tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capabilities and contextual coherence of LLM Agents by addressing limitations in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval.

Method: The proposed H-MEM organizes memory hierarchically by semantic abstraction and uses an index-based routing mechanism for efficient retrieval, eliminating exhaustive similarity computations.

Result: Experimental results on the LoCoMo dataset demonstrate that H-MEM outperforms five baseline methods across five task settings.

Conclusion: The H-MEM architecture effectively enhances long-term memory capabilities in LLM Agents and improves their decision-making and contextual understanding in dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative input embedding technique for document-level relation extraction to utilize global context and multi-sentence reasoning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in document-level relation extraction fail to fully capture the global document context due to their limited focus on sentences where entities are mentioned.

Method: A novel input embedding approach that encodes the positions of mentioned entities across the document, leveraging global relationships and representing entities as standalone segments.

Result: The proposed method outperformed previous approaches on three benchmark datasets: DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting document-level relationships.

Conclusion: The research advances global context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning, with theoretical implications for NLP and practical contributions to real-world applications requiring enhanced relationship detection.

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark to assess LLMs' document utilization within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, emphasizing progressive dimensions for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RAG benchmarks lack a systematic framework to evaluate the LLM-specific capabilities, particularly in document utilization.

Method: A novel placeholder-based approach is designed to decouple contributions of LLMs’ parametric and external knowledge, enabling a fine-grained evaluation across filtering, combination, and reasoning dimensions.

Result: Experiments reveal limitations of LLMs in error resilience and context faithfulness within RAG systems, highlighting challenges in generation capabilities.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a reproducible framework for improving RAG systems and understanding LLM utilization. Code is publicly available for further development.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explored the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs) and revealed that CoT prompting improves accuracy by inducing more interpretable and modular internal representations in larger models like Pythia-2.8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether CoT prompting reflects the true internal reasoning process in LLMs, and whether it improves their computation and interpretability.

Method: Sparse autoencoders and activation patching were combined to extract monosemantic features from LLMs (Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B) solving GSM8K math problems, comparing CoT and plain prompting setups. A feature-swapping experiment was used to test causal relationships.

Result: In the Pythia-2.8B model, swapping CoT-reasoning features significantly increased answer confidence, while Pythia-70M showed no reliable effect. CoT also increased activation sparsity and feature interpretability in the larger model, suggesting more modular computation.

Conclusion: CoT prompting induces more interpretable and effective internal structures in large LLMs, particularly in higher-capacity models, validating its role as a structured and beneficial prompting method.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EH-Benchmark to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ophthalmic diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with hallucinations in ophthalmic diagnosis due to limited domain knowledge, inadequate visual reasoning capabilities, and insufficient multimodal data, hindering accurate diagnosis.

Method: The paper proposes a novel benchmark (EH-Benchmark) categorizing hallucinations into Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, coupled with a three-phase agent-centric framework: Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively reduces hallucinations, improving accuracy, interpretability, and reliability in MLLMs.

Conclusion: The EH-Benchmark proves instrumental in both assessing and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs, paving the way for more reliable ophthalmic diagnostic tools. The project is open-source.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy risks on social platforms by developing a synthetic dataset to detect PII-revealing texts, ensuring safety for research use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks posed by PII-revealing self-disclosures on social platforms and overcome the lack of open-source annotated data for advancing research.

Method: The authors generated a synthetic PII-labeled dataset using three LLMs (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and zephyr-7b-beta) with sequential instruction prompting, along with a taxonomy of 19 PII categories. The data was evaluated on reproducibility, unlinkability, and indistinguishability criteria.

Result: The generated synthetic dataset showed equivalence in model performance to real data, was unlinkable to the original users, and was indistinguishable from real content by trained humans.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates a safe and effective approach for creating synthetic datasets to study privacy risks on social media, enabling reproducible research.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

### [44] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG optimizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by using adaptive context compression rather than fixed rates, speeding up inference while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of fixed-rate context compression in RAG, which either over-compresses simple queries or under-compresses complex ones, increasing computational costs.

Method: ACC-RAG employs a hierarchical compressor for creating multi-granular embeddings and a context selector to adaptively retain essential information based on input complexity.

Result: ACC-RAG demonstrated significant improvements in computational efficiency, achieving over four times faster inference compared to standard RAG while retaining or improving accuracy on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic context compression tailored to input complexity is superior to fixed-rate methods for improving both efficiency and accuracy in retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper reviews methods that combine visual-language models with external symbolic systems to address limitations in reasoning, memory, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address deficiencies in current visual-language models, particularly their lack of explainability, resource-intensive retraining process, and limitations in logical reasoning.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted to categorize techniques for enhancing visual-language models via neural-symbolic systems.

Result: Key techniques are identified for integrating visual-language models with external symbolic systems, improving reasoning and memory.

Conclusion: Neural-symbolic systems provide a promising solution to overcome the limitations of visual-language models through enhanced reasoning, interpretability, and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deriving operational intelligence from organizational data while balancing data confidentiality and integration, and to adapt NLP tools for domain-specific tasks in areas like operations and maintenance.

Method: The paper breaks down the Knowledge Extraction process into components like Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction. It evaluates sixteen NLP tools and Large Language Models on a public dataset of aviation maintenance issues, testing zero-shot performance in secure environments.

Result: The study identifies significant performance limitations in current NLP and LLM tools for trusted applications, highlighting their limited readiness for critical industries like aviation.

Conclusion: The authors recommend strategies to improve trust in NLP tools, discuss their readiness levels for mission-critical applications, and provide an open-source dataset for broader evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five leading LLMs (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek) on financial text analysis using 10-K filings, finding GPT to have the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic comparisons among leading LLMs in FinNLP tasks, especially given their growing role in financial analyses.

Method: Evaluated LLMs using domain-specific prompts and three methodologies: human annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (e.g., ROUGE), and model behavior diagnostics across financial 10-K filings.

Result: GPT demonstrated the best performance, providing coherent, semantically aligned, and relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity. In contrast, Gemini and DeepSeek showed higher variability and reduced agreement.

Conclusion: LLMs display differing levels of performance depending on prompt design, source material, and financial contexts, with GPT emerging as the leader in FinNLP tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the CoE-Ops framework, which uses ensemble methods and a task classifier based on a large language model (LLM) for enhanced performance in AIOps tasks. It achieves improved routing and resolution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single AIOps models constrained by domain-specific knowledge, and to leverage benefits of ensemble learning methods for better performance in diverse DevOps tasks.

Method: CoE-Ops framework integrates a task classifier based on general-purpose LLM and employs retrieval-augmented generation to handle both high-level and low-level AIOps tasks.

Result: CoE-Ops shows a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level tasks, 8% accuracy enhancement in problem resolution compared to single AIOps models, and outperforms larger-scale MoE models by 14% in accuracy.

Conclusion: Collaborative ensemble frameworks like CoE-Ops can effectively overcome domain-specific restrictions and boost AIOps task performance with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper describes a solution for answering telecom-related technical questions from documents using a method that integrates graph representations of flowcharts into text-based QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based systems struggle to answer questions relying on visual elements like flowcharts. This paper seeks to improve question-answering accuracy by incorporating graph representations of flowcharts from Visual Language Models.

Method: The approach involves processing technical documents, classifying images, creating graph representations using a Visual Language Model, and embedding these graphs into a text-based pipeline for question-answering.

Result: The fine-tuned Visual Language Model generates graph representations closely matching ground truth, improving QA performance in datasets from telecom product documentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves question-answering accuracy for flowchart-based queries while reducing reliance on costly Visual Language Models during inference.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RELIANCE, a framework improving reasoning factual accuracy in Large Language Models (LLMs) using fact-checking, reinforcement learning, and interpretability tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factual inaccuracies in intermediate reasoning steps of LLMs pose risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and science.

Method: The framework involves a fact-checking classifier, a reinforcement learning approach focusing on factuality and coherence, and an interpretability module analyzing model activations.

Result: RELIANCE improved factual robustness by up to 49.90% in evaluation across ten models while maintaining performance on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning reliability in LLMs and proposes future directions for training models to target factuality improvements.

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT leverages textual medical data by utilizing advanced embedding and geometric feature extraction techniques for survival analysis, achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survival models struggle with complex sequential textual data in healthcare; motivating the need for a solution like SigBERT.

Method: SigBERT translates medical report sequences into sentence embeddings, applies geometric feature extraction through rough path theory, and integrates these features into a LASSO Cox model.

Result: Achieved a C-index score of 0.75 on a real-world oncology dataset, indicating enhanced survival model performance.

Conclusion: SigBERT demonstrates the effective integration of temporal sequential data in survival analysis using novel mathematical techniques, improving risk prediction in healthcare.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient methods for validating code-based algorithms in large claims databases by using NLP and adaptive sampling, tested in a case study involving intentional self-harm in obese patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of extensive time and resource requirements in validating health outcome algorithms, which can improve the reliability of database studies.

Method: The proposed method combines natural language processing (NLP) to reduce human review time and a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined stopping criteria for precision assessment.

Result: Using NLP reduced chart review time by 40%, and adaptive sampling prevented the review of 77% of charts with minimal impact on precision.

Conclusion: This efficient approach can routinely validate algorithms, enhancing the reliability of inferences derived from complex database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Motivation: Traditionally, arbitrariness is viewed as a flaw associated with injustice. The paper aims to reframe it as a deliberate structural mechanism essential for the operation of human systems, addressing its role in power and interpersonal relationships.

Method: The paper builds on Saussure's semiotic principles and Shannon's entropy model, employs the "Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability" chain framework, and theorizes arbitrariness using formal models to connect social dynamics with linguistic and legal systems.

Result: The study formalizes arbitrariness as conditional entropy and demonstrates its applicability across domains, including human systems and artificial intelligence. It highlights mechanisms like "immotivization" and "Conflict Lateralization" that shield authority from accountability.

Conclusion: Arbitrariness is not merely an injustice marker but a neutral operator essential to both control and care in interpersonal and systemic relations, offering new avenues for studying explainability in AI and enhancing understanding of social structures.

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

### [58] [C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968)
*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs), emphasizing their challenges compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) and introducing a benchmark dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the practical effectiveness of SDMs in emulating human conversations, which are inherently more complex than text-based interactions.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset in English and Chinese with 1,079 instances and develops an LLM-based evaluation approach that aligns with human judgment.

Result: The benchmark dataset and evaluation method provide insights into SDMs' performance in handling challenges like ambiguity and context-dependency in spoken dialogue.

Conclusion: This research advances understanding of SDMs, offering tools to evaluate their ability to emulate human voice interactions and addressing complexities inherent to spoken dialogue.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

*Valeria de Paiva,Qiyue Gao,Hai Hu,Pavel Kovalev,Yikang Liu,Lawrence S. Moss,Zhiheng Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of contemporary large language models (LLMs) in performing natural language inference (NLI) on mathematical texts, creating specific Math NLI datasets and testing LLMs' performance and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether current LLMs can understand and infer meaning from mathematical texts, addressing their potential and limitations in this domain.

Method: A Math NLI corpus is constructed with premises extracted from mathematical texts and hypotheses labeled by experts. The study also examines LLM-generated hypotheses and tests the performance and consistency of various LLMs.

Result: The study found mixed results: LLMs can sometimes perform equivalently to human-labeled data via majority voting, but they also fail basic mathematical inferences, indicating limitations in dealing with mathematical language.

Conclusion: While LLMs exhibit potential in Math NLI tasks, their struggles with mathematical language reveal significant areas for improvement. The provided dataset aims to support further advancements in this field.

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP), achieving competitive results without fine-tuning the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a practical and effective way to perform Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) tasks using Large Language Models without needing model fine-tuning, which is traditionally required.

Method: The authors propose generating task-specific prompts using the FrameNet database, incorporating frame definitions and annotated examples, to guide the Large Language Models for Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) subtasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves F1 scores of 94.3% for Frame Identification (FI) and 77.4% for Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL), demonstrating competitive performance.

Conclusion: In-Context Learning with LLMs provides a viable alternative to model fine-tuning for domain-specific Frame Semantic Parsing tasks, utilizing automatically crafted task-specific prompts.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARoPE, a novel dynamic positional encoding for Transformers that adapts RoPE to be context- and token-sensitive, significantly improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), which use static sinusoidal frequency patterns and lack context sensitivity, impeding their ability to model complex token relationships in self-attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose CARoPE, a generalized version of RoPE that generates head-specific, token-conditioned frequency patterns by applying input-dependent phase shifts into the rotary mechanism across attention heads, maintaining RoPE's simplicity and efficiency.

Result: Experimental results on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset reveal that CARoPE outperforms RoPE and other baselines in next-token prediction tasks, achieving lower perplexity at longer context lengths and faster training throughput while preserving model stability.

Conclusion: CARoPE is a scalable, expressive, and efficient alternative to existing positional encoding strategies, advancing the state of positional embedding in Transformer models.

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: Introduces SMART-Editor, a framework for consistent editing across structured and unstructured data using reward-guided strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining global coherence during content and layout edits across multiple domains.

Method: Introduces Reward-Refine (inference optimization) and RewardDPO (training optimization) strategies, and evaluates performance using SMARTEdit-Bench benchmark.

Result: SMART-Editor outperforms baselines with up to 15% improvements in structured domains and notable gains in unstructured settings.

Conclusion: Reward-guided planning significantly improves semantic and visual editing coherence across diverse domains.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

*Jeffrey Eben,Aitzaz Ahmad,Stephen Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a retrieval architecture for natural language database interfaces that avoids domain-specific fine-tuning and scales effectively to enterprise-level data catalogs by decomposing database schemas into semantic units for targeted retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of effectively scaling natural language interfaces for enterprise-level databases has remained unaddressed. Existing solutions require domain-specific fine-tuning and fail to utilize the semantic context from database metadata.

Method: The authors present a component-based retrieval architecture where database schemas and metadata are broken into semantic units for indexing. It prioritizes table identification and manages column-level information to keep retrieved tables within a contextual budget.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves high recall and accuracy and outperforms baseline methods on large, complex database structures.

Conclusion: This method offers scalable, accurate text-to-SQL solutions that eliminate specialized fine-tuning, making it deployable across diverse enterprise database environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

*Xinwei Wu,Haojie Li,Hongyu Liu,Xinyu Ji,Ruohan Li,Yule Chen,Yigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines large language models' (LLMs) challenges in handling Chinese textual ambiguity, finding notable limitations in their ability to distinguish and interpret ambiguous text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the trustworthiness of LLMs in processing ambiguous narrative text, especially in Chinese, an area critical for their real-world application.

Method: The authors created a benchmark dataset of ambiguous sentences (categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories) with context and their disambiguated versions and conducted systematic experiments to analyze LLM behavior.

Result: LLMs exhibited significant fragility in handling ambiguity, showing overconfidence in single interpretations, inability to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous text, and overthinking when interpreting multiple meanings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit fundamental limitations in processing linguistic ambiguity, indicating the need for improved techniques, especially for real-world deployment. The dataset and tools are openly shared for further research.

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

*Ananya Sadana,Yash Kumar Lal,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISO-Bench to test multimodal models on their ability to determine causal relationships between images and procedural text. Current models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding causal relationships between modalities, such as images and text, which is critical for multimodal models used in real-world tasks.

Method: ISO-Bench presents paired examples of task-step images and procedural text with the objective to infer whether the visual step occurs before or after the text step. Ten vision-language models are evaluated on the benchmark.

Result: The best zero-shot F1 score was 0.57, and improvements through chain-of-thought reasoning only reached 0.62 F1, which is substantially worse than human performance (0.98 F1).

Conclusion: There is a significant gap in causal understanding between current multimodal models and humans, suggesting more research and improvements are needed.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

*Yuhan Liu,Michael J. Q. Zhang,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using implicit user feedback from interactions with language models to improve their performance, finding varying effectiveness based on feedback specifics and user prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve language models through user interactions without requiring explicit feedback, which may disrupt user experiences.

Method: The study analyzes implicit user feedback from two datasets (WildChat and LMSYS), focusing on user-LLM conversations and evaluating the feedback's impact on model performance for different question types.

Result: User feedback, particularly its content (like clarification requests), helps with short, human-designed questions but struggles with longer, complex queries. Its effectiveness also depends greatly on the quality of user prompts.

Conclusion: Implicit user feedback has potential for enhancing language models, but its usefulness is limited under certain conditions, particularly with complex tasks or poorly framed user prompts.

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LENS, a method leveraging internal representations of LLMs to estimate confidence and improve ensemble learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ensemble methods for combining LLMs often overlook the context-dependent reliability of models.

Method: LENS trains lightweight linear predictors using internal hidden states and normalized probabilities from LLMs to estimate confidence.

Result: LENS achieves superior performance compared to traditional ensemble methods in experiments on multiple-choice and boolean Q&A tasks.

Conclusion: Internal representations can be harnessed for nuanced confidence estimation, bolstering ensemble techniques with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

TL;DR: GEAK leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate GPU kernels using Triton for AMD hardware, achieving higher correctness and speed compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing demand for scalable and hardware-optimized GPU kernel solutions in light of complex AI workloads.

Method: GEAK uses inference-time compute scaling and a reasoning loop based on Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms to generate Triton-based GPU kernels for AMD GPUs.

Result: GEAK outperformed baseline methods with correctness reaching 63% and execution speed improvements of up to 2.59X.

Conclusion: Agentic code generation frameworks like GEAK promise to accelerate adoption of diverse hardware platforms while democratizing expert kernel performance.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance few-shot in-context learning (ICL) performance by utilizing both Positive and Negative samples for better context example selection, showing its efficacy through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sensitivity of few-shot ICL to selected examples along with the lack of focus on leveraging Negative samples in previous studies motivated the authors to investigate integrating Negative samples into the learning process to improve example selection.

Method: The approach involves constructing Positive and Negative sample corpora based on Zero-Shot-Cot, selecting semantically similar examples for a given query, and leveraging Negative examples to refine the selection of Positive examples for crafting ICL demonstrations.

Result: Experimental results indicate that utilizing both Positive and Negative samples for selection improves ICL performance compared to relying solely on the most similar Positive examples.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that incorporating information from Negative samples enhances Positive example selection, ultimately optimizing few-shot ICL performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) introduce semantically rich topic modeling by leveraging interpretable features learned through Sparse Autoencoders. MTMs overcome limitations of traditional word-based topic models, offering deeper thematic analysis and controllable text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and neural topic models struggle to represent complex semantic themes because of their reliance on bag-of-words or word-list-based representations of topics.

Method: MTMs leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to learn interpretable features and define topics in a semantically rich space. They also incorporate a novel evaluation framework, 'topic judge,' using LLM-based pairwise comparison to assess topic quality.

Result: MTMs demonstrate superior coherence over traditional and neural baselines across five datasets and are consistently preferred in evaluations conducted by topic judge. Additionally, they enable effective topic-driven control of language model outputs.

Conclusion: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) provide a significant advance in topic modeling, enabling the analysis of deeper conceptual themes and practical applications like controlled text generation.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAP-GPT, a framework adapting a tabular-specialized large language model for Alzheimer's diagnosis using structured biomarker data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease requires handling complex biomarker data, and large language models offer capabilities suitable for this task.

Method: The authors adapt TableGPT2 for structured biomarker-based diagnosis with few-shot learning and fine-tuning using qLoRA for binary classification.

Result: TAP-GPT outperforms general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model in AD prediction using biomarker data.

Conclusion: This framework is the first to apply LLMs to tabular biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating promise for future advancements in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Method: The authors introduce the P-ReMe dataset, redefine implicature and presupposition for mental health, formulate associated tasks, and benchmark four models (Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen). Additionally, stigma-related prompts (StiPRompts) are studied with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Mistral and Qwen demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities for mental health reasoning tasks, while Claude-3.5-haiku effectively addressed stigma-related prompts.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the reasoning capacities of LLMs for mental health applications and highlights the potential of some models to responsibly handle mental health-related stigma.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

*Shimanto Bhowmik,Tawsif Tashwar Dipto,Md Sazzad Islam,Sheryl Hsu,Tahsin Reasat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in Bengali NLP and evaluates 10 open-source LLMs on translated datasets, identifying performance inconsistencies and areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle underrepresentation of Bengali in NLP research by diagnosing challenges, including lack of standardized benchmarks, and evaluating performance of recent LLMs.

Method: The authors evaluated 10 open-source LLMs on 8 translated datasets and performed error analysis to identify failure modes, examining tokenization efficiency and multilingual robustness.

Result: The study found performance gaps between Bengali and English, especially in smaller models and certain families like Mistral, while architectures like DeepSeek showed robustness. They identified an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and model accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for better datasets and evaluation methods for multilingual NLP, aiming to drive further research on underrepresented languages. The dataset and code are made publicly available to aid this goal.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers the pivotal role of 'Super Experts' (SEs) in enhancing the performance of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, identifying them as a small but critical subset of experts whose pruning causes significant drops in model efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the heterogeneous importance of experts in MoE models, as prior approaches only empirically addressed expert-level compression without deeper exploration.

Method: Through analysis, the study identifies 'Super Experts' by detecting their rare but extreme activation patterns in the model's forward inference and investigates their significance through pruning and task-specific assessments.

Result: The findings reveal that SEs contribute heavily to model performance, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning, and pruning them disrupts attention score distribution significantly.

Conclusion: The research concludes that SEs are integral to MoE LLM performance, as they influence essential mechanisms like attention score distribution, underscoring the need for careful handling in compression efforts.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Laura Pinnavaia,Vojimir Ranitovic,Elisabetta Rocchetti,Alice Tuveri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines implicit moderation in GPT-4o-mini, revealing that it tends to sanitize sensitive content during paraphrasing and effectively shifts language to less sensitive tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether proprietary large language models, like GPT-4o-mini, naturally sanitize sensitive content without explicit instructions.

Method: The authors analyzed GPT-4o-mini's behavior in paraphrasing sensitive content and compared its zero-shot classification capabilities regarding sensitivity against traditional methods.

Result: GPT-4o-mini systematically reduces derogatory and taboo language while shifting content to less sensitive categories.

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini demonstrates implicit content moderation tendencies and aligns with less sensitive tones during paraphrasing, reaffirming its potential for sensitive content handling in an unsupervised manner.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

*Daeyong Kwon,SeungHeon Doh,Juhan Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MusT-RAG adapts general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) for music-focused question answering by integrating a specialized music retrieval framework, outperforming traditional fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well in many domains, their efficacy in music-related applications is limited due to insufficient music-specific training data.

Method: The researchers use the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, employing a specialized music vector database (MusWikiDB) and leveraging context information in inference and fine-tuning stages.

Result: MusT-RAG shows superior performance in adapting LLMs to music domains and enhances efficiency compared to general databases.

Conclusion: Integrating external, domain-specific knowledge like MusWikiDB substantially improves the performance of LLMs in music-related tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

*Renato Vukovic,Carel van Niekerk,Michael Heck,Benjamin Ruppik,Hsien-Chin Lin,Shutong Feng,Nurul Lubis,Milica Gasic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeQoDO, a method where large language models autonomously build task-oriented dialogue ontologies using SQL programming capabilities without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-oriented dialogue systems depend on manually labeled or supervised training for ontology construction, which limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose TeQoDO, using large language models with inherent SQL programming capabilities guided by dialogue theory to autonomously construct TOD ontologies from scratch.

Result: TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning methods and produces competitive ontologies for downstream dialogue tasks, showing scalability for larger datasets like Wikipedia and ArXiv.

Conclusion: TeQoDO demonstrates autonomous ontology construction, advancing LLM explainability and scalability, representing progress towards broader ontology application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPCC, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on planning tasks constrained by complex multimodal requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks cannot adequately assess real-world multimodal planning or deal with constraints across modalities.

Method: The authors present the MPCC framework, which focuses on evaluating MLLMs' ability to handle complex constraints in planning scenarios across three tasks with graded difficulty levels.

Result: Experiments show that MLLMs struggle to handle multimodal constraints, with feasible plans for closed-source models at 21.3% and open-source models below 11%.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning as MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity, and traditional strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

### [79] [Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23386)
*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal2Vec is an innovative embedding model that enhances decoder-only LLMs' performance without modifying their architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks while significantly reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for embedding models with decoder-only LLMs either eliminate the causal attention mask, potentially affecting semantic extraction, or use extra input text, which increases computational demands.

Method: Causal2Vec uses a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode input text into a single Contextual token. This token is appended to the input sequence of the LLM, enabling contextualized representation without relying on bidirectional attention. The final embedding concatenates hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens.

Result: Causal2Vec demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) with reduced input sequence lengths (up to 85%) and faster inference time (up to 82%) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Causal2Vec provides an efficient, architecture-preserving approach to enhance embedding performance in decoder-only LLMs, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates locally-deployable open-source language models as alternatives to proprietary cloud-based AI solutions for translators, focusing on functional performance and benefits like data control and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by concerns regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access in commercial AI chatbots used for translation, prompting exploration of accessible alternatives.

Method: Three open-source language models were installed on CPU-based platforms, evaluated for performance, and compared to proprietary cloud-based systems, focusing on ease of use and functional capabilities.

Result: The local deployment presented challenges but demonstrated potential benefits in data control, privacy, and reducing reliance on cloud services, offering viable solutions for individual translators and small businesses.

Conclusion: This research highlights the feasibility of locally deployable language models, encourages broader accessibility, and supports democratization efforts in AI technology for translation applications.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization method using multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization to address redundancy and complex relationships among documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-document summarization struggle with representing rich relational information and require a predefined number of clusters, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: The authors use a multi-relational graph to model semantic and discourse relations, employ a structural entropy minimization algorithm to cluster sentences without predefined cluster counts, and utilize a position-aware compression mechanism for summarization.

Result: Experiments on four datasets (Multi-News, DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) show that MRGSEM-Sum consistently outperforms other unsupervised methods and sometimes matches supervised approaches and large language models.

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum offers a robust unsupervised framework for multi-document summarization, achieving high-quality summaries with strong consistency and coverage while advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Motivation: Address the underrepresentation of Arabic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) systems by overcoming challenges such as Arabic's complex morphology, optional diacritics, and the coexistence of dialects with Modern Standard Arabic.

Method: Developing an enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval framework with adaptive Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) and integrating pre-trained Arabic language models for better retrieval and ranking accuracy.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in answering Arabic questions with enhanced retrieval performance and increased ranking accuracy.

Conclusion: The newfound methodology strengthens retrieval systems for the Arabic language and provides a public codebase on GitHub for further use and development.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces proactive critical thinking in AI, where models actively seek missing information to resolve queries. Two benchmarks, GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, are developed to evaluate mathematical reasoning under incomplete or distracting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance AI systems to address flawed data and reasoning by developing proactive methods instead of passive rejection.

Method: Develop GSM-MC and GSM-MCE benchmarks, assess reasoning models, and implement reinforcement learning to improve proactive critical thinking.

Result: Experiments with Qwen3 and Llama models show difficulty in proactive reasoning, but employing reinforcement learning boosts performance significantly. Qwen3-1.7B model accuracy increased from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC.

Conclusion: Proactive critical thinking substantially improves AI's ability to collaborate effectively with humans, advancing problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate responses based on user roles in enterprise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly used in enterprises, there is a need to customize model behavior based on user roles while ensuring safety and avoiding harmful outputs.

Method: This study proposes three approaches: BERT-based classification, LLM-based classification, and role-conditioned generation. Two datasets—one adapted from instruction-tuning corpora and another synthetically created—are used for evaluation.

Result: The models are tested for robustness against challenges such as prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts within varied organizational setups.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs for role-specific access constraints is feasible and necessary for secure enterprise application.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating safety and effectiveness of large language models in healthcare settings.

Method: Developed the CSEDB framework with 30 criteria, consensus among 32 physicians, reviewed 2,069 Q&A items across 26 clinical departments, and conducted benchmarks on six LLMs.

Result: LLMs scored moderately (57.2% average overall performance), with domain-specific models outperforming general-purpose ones, especially in high-risk scenarios.

Conclusion: The CSEDB provides a standardized evaluation metric that can guide safer and more effective use of LLMs in clinical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential

Method: The paper introduces Med-R$^3$, a framework that progressively builds reasoning skills before optimizing retrieval capabilities and achieves joint optimization of retrieval and reasoning using reinforcement learning tailored to the medical domain.

Result: The model, augmented with Med-R$^3$, outperforms baseline models, achieving up to a 13.53% improvement over comparable scales.

Conclusion: Med-R$^3$ successfully demonstrates the benefits of a progressive and reinforcement learning-driven approach for integrating retrieval and reasoning in medical applications.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-Detect, a heavy-tailed statistical method based on the Student's t-distribution for detecting adversarial machine-generated texts, yielding state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing zero-shot detectors that rely on Gaussian statistical assumptions, which fail against adversarial or non-native English text.

Method: T-Detect uses heavy-tailed discrepancy scores from the Student's t-distribution for normalized text detection calculations, leveraging its resistance to statistical outliers.

Result: T-Detect outperformed strong baselines, showing a performance uplift of up to 3.9% in AUROC on adversarial text benchmarks (RAID and HART domains).

Conclusion: The method establishes a new statistical foundation for text detection, providing robust and state-of-the-art performance, especially under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Differential attention is adapted to a parameter-efficient model, DiffLoRA, achieving mixed results in NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the performance benefits of differential attention with LoRA's parameter efficiency.

Method: Introduce DiffLoRA, using low-rank adapters in positive and negative attention terms to implement differential attention efficiently.

Result: DiffLoRA underperforms compared to other methods except in specific domains, such as +11 points improvement on LoRA in HumanEval.

Conclusion: DiffLoRA demonstrates potential in certain specialized tasks but lacks general performance compared to alternatives.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses Arabic hate speech detection and text cleaning using deep learning models, achieving high efficacy in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the growing issue of hate speech in Arabic social media by providing solutions for its detection and removal.

Method: Deep learning models and transformer-based methods are used for hate speech detection, while a machine translation approach is adopted for text cleaning.

Result: Achieved 92% Macro F1 score and 95% accuracy in detection; text cleaning model achieved a BLEU score of 0.3 with 1-gram.

Conclusion: The approaches successfully demonstrate effective hate speech detection and cleaning methods, setting benchmarks in Arabic social media processing.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language explanations for logical rules extracted from knowledge graphs, aiming to improve human comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the comprehensibility of logical rules in knowledge graphs to enhance reasoning, error detection, and subtle data pattern identification.

Method: Logical rules were extracted using the AMIE 3.5.1 algorithm from FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets. Various LLM prompting strategies such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting were evaluated.

Result: Promising performance was observed in terms of explanation correctness and clarity based on comprehensive human evaluation, though challenges like hallucination persist.

Conclusion: Large language models show potential for generating clear explanations for logical rules, yet refining strategies to address hallucination issues remains essential for future efforts.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their problem-solving abilities through staged question disclosures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking LLMs via QA performance indirectly evaluates their underlying capabilities; a more accurate, scalable method is needed.

Method: The framework introduces a stagewise question disclosure, where partial information about each question is unveiled progressively to test reasoning.

Result: This method produces more accurate comparisons among LLMs, shows improved intermediate reasoning traces, and narrows perceived performance gaps.

Conclusion: The standard QA paradigm may exaggerate performance differences; the proposed method offers a better alternative for evaluating LLMs' true capabilities.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spike-based NeRF framework using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a dynamic adaptive training strategy to reduce computational costs and increase energy efficiency while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NeRF-based models are computationally intensive and not suitable for resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing, prompting the need for more energy-efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors propose Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA), a training strategy that balances rendering quality and computational efficiency, leveraging Spiking Neural Networks and scene-adaptive inference.

Result: Experimental evaluations using Instant-NGP architecture revealed a preservation of rendering quality while achieving a 64% reduction in inference time steps and a 61.55% decrease in running power.

Conclusion: PATA demonstrates the potential of SNNs in neural rendering by enabling computationally efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering, making NeRF-based models more suitable for edge computing applications.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The framework focuses on efficient reconstruction and real-time rendering of large urban scenes while addressing appearance inconsistencies and offering high visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in efficiently reconstructing large-scale urban scenes with appearance variations and ensure robustness for real-time rendering.

Method: The framework includes visibility-based image selection, LOD control for Gaussian density regulation, appearance transformation, and enhancement modules like depth and scale regularization.

Result: Demonstrates superior scene reconstruction efficiency and quality compared to prior work while enabling real-time rendering.

Conclusion: The approach enhances urban-scale scene reconstruction reliability and enables efficient, high-quality rendering with improved appearance consistency across images.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: ScanDiff is a novel model combining diffusion models and Vision Transformers to predict more diverse and realistic human gaze scanpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods in capturing variability of human visual exploration during gaze scanpaths.

Method: Utilizes diffusion models and Vision Transformers to stochastically generate diverse scanpaths, with added textual conditioning for task-driven objectives.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, producing more diverse and accurate results on benchmark datasets in free-viewing and task-driven scenarios.

Conclusion: ScanDiff enhances gaze prediction by better modeling the complexity of human visual behaviors, advancing research in the field.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) models significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in low-quality echocardiograms, especially in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained settings frequently face challenges due to the poor quality of echocardiographic imaging, hindering the utility of diagnostic models. This paper aims to explore SR techniques to overcome these barriers.

Method: The paper employs two SR models, SRGAN and SRResNet, applied on low-quality echocardiograms from the CAMUS dataset to assess performance on two classification tasks: Chamer view (2CH vs. 4CH) and phase classification (ED vs. ES).

Result: SRResNet outperformed SRGAN, yielding significant improvements in classification accuracy metrics while also being computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: Super-resolution techniques effectively enhance diagnostic quality in noisy echocardiograms, presenting a promising solution for AI-assisted healthcare in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive is a single-branch vision-language system designed for autonomous vehicles, integrating multi-modal data for navigation, achieving state-of-the-art results in performance and safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for autonomous vehicles to react quickly and robustly in complex environments while minimizing abrupt movements and improving energy efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces NovaDrive, which uses a single-branch vision-language architecture to process diverse inputs like camera images, HD maps, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints through two-stage cross-attention. Fine-tuning of an 11B LLaMA vision-language backbone and a novel smoothness loss are key components.

Result: NovaDrive improves success rates, path efficiency, and collision reduction in the MD-NEX benchmark, achieving 84% success rate (+4%), 0.66 path efficiency (+0.11), and a collision reduction of 1.4%.

Conclusion: NovaDrive optimizes safety, energy efficiency, and navigational performance in autonomous driving, presenting a scalable architecture potentially applicable to other embodied AI fields.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel synthetic data generation methods: MObI for multimodal object inpainting in autonomous driving, and AnydoorMed for anomaly inpainting in medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging require extensive and realistic multimodal data, which synthetic methods can provide more feasibly than real-world data collection.

Method: The authors propose MObI, a diffusion model framework for inserting objects into existing multimodal scenes, and AnydoorMed, a method for anomaly inpainting in medical scans, both leveraging reference guidance.

Result: MObI achieves realistic and semantically consistent object insertions, and AnydoorMed preserves structural details while blending anomalies into mammography scans.

Conclusion: These methods adapt foundational reference-guided inpainting models to diverse modalities, advancing synthetic data generation for use in critical applications.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

TL;DR: Autonomous driving model XYZ-Drive integrates vision, map, and waypoints for precise navigation, achieving superior benchmark performance and interpretability using a fine-tuned vision-language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify geometric accuracy and semantic understanding in autonomous driving by addressing their historically separate treatment in navigation systems.

Method: XYZ-Drive fuses input from a camera frame, an overhead map, and a waypoint using a goal-centered cross-attention mechanism. This data is then processed using a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B vision-language model.

Result: The model achieves a benchmark success rate of 95%, surpassing previous methods by 15%, with reduced collision rates and improved computational efficiency through a single-branch approach.

Conclusion: XYZ-Drive highlights the importance of combining modalities and utilizing goal-centered fusion mechanisms for effective autonomous driving, with significant improvements attributed to fine-tuning and high-resolution input data.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-FineR, a training-free method for fine-grained image classification that integrates large language models and vision-language models for open-set recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-grained image classification methods rely on fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, which limit their scalability and adaptability in dynamic, real-world environments. Emerging classes and the absence of expert annotations further complicate the challenge.

Method: The proposed E-FineR framework employs a training-free approach that enriches the capabilities of large language models and vision-language models to achieve state-of-the-art fine-grained classification results. It eliminates rigid label dependence and offers greater interpretability.

Result: E-FineR achieved state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained classification tasks, as well as comparable results in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, without requiring extensive training or human intervention.

Conclusion: The framework shifts classification from rigid label prediction to a flexible, language-driven understanding, making it scalable and applicable to real-world scenarios. It highlights the potential for adaptable and generalizable systems in new, annotation-scarce domains.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is

*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new state-of-the-art framework for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) by combining and refining existing concepts to address key challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of integrating vision-language models (VLMs) for accurate 3D proposals and classification in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation.

Method: The framework follows a two-stage approach: robust 3D proposal generation using tracking-based aggregation and merging/removal techniques, and a classification stage employing Alpha-CLIP for object-centric representation combined with SMS scoring for filtering false positives.

Result: The proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets, surpassing even closed-vocabulary end-to-end methods in metrics like AP and AR.

Conclusion: Careful combination and refinement of complementary concepts significantly improve OV-3DIS, highlighting the efficacy of this novel framework.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-NeMo, a zero-shot diffusion-based method for animating portraits by addressing identity leakage and improving motion expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of identity leakage and difficulty in representing subtle and extreme expressions in existing portrait animation methods.

Method: A fully end-to-end framework leveraging a latent 1D motion descriptor and cross-attention for motion control, combined with dual GAN supervision, spatial and color augmentations, and a design to prevent spatial structure leakage.

Result: X-NeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing expressive portrait animations while preserving identity.

Conclusion: X-NeMo provides an effective and innovative approach to portrait animation, addressing persistent issues and achieving superior outcomes. Resources are available for further research.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel neural inverse rendering method to jointly reconstruct geometry, reflectance, and lighting from multi-view images taken under varying lighting, without requiring prior calibration or intermediate cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view photometric stereo methods depend on light calibration or intermediate cues, which limits their flexibility and usability.

Method: The approach encodes both geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields using shadow-aware volume rendering, and employs a spatial and reflectance network to optimize scene parameters directly from raw images.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in shape and lighting estimation accuracy and is effective for unaligned multi-light images and challenging object geometries.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a robust and generalizable solution for joint scene reconstruction, even in complex and unconstrained scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced network for single-image rain streak removal, introducing Corner Loss to retain structural details and a Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module for targeted feature enhancement, yielding superior quantitative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rain streak removal methods often fail to maintain fine structural details while improving overall visual quality.

Method: The method introduces a unique Corner Loss to preserve object boundaries and texture and employs R-CBAM Blocks in the encoder-decoder structure for feature enhancement in spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Experiments on Rain100L and Rain100H datasets show substantial improvement in PSNR scores: 33.29 dB for Rain100L and 26.16 dB for Rain100H.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances noise removal and detail preservation, outperforming previous techniques in single-image rain streak removal.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

*Shiyao Yu,Zi-An Wang,Kangning Yin,Zheng Tian,Mingyuan Zhang,Weixin Si,Shihao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal framework for motion retrieval, incorporating four modalities (text, audio, video, motion) using sequence-level contrastive learning to improve retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval models lack intuitive interactions and do not utilize sequential representations of modalities effectively. Additionally, they fail to include audio as a modality, which could enhance immersion and usability.

Method: The authors propose a fine-grained joint embedding space aligning text, audio, video, and motion, achieved through sequence-level contrastive learning. They also create new datasets by augmenting text-motion datasets with synthetic audio.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods, with a 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating audio and leveraging multi-modal integration significantly enhance motion retrieval performance, suggesting a promising direction for advancing motion acquisition technologies.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new benchmarking dataset for identifying flooded areas in satellite images, focusing on the 2019 Midwestern USA floods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study notes a lack of suitable datasets for segmentation of flooded areas in satellite imagery, despite a review of 77 existing benchmarks.

Method: Satellite imagery from five Midwestern US states captured during the 2019 floods was collected and standardized, and semantic segmentation models were tested and studied on this dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art models showed modest performance, indicating potential improvement areas with multimodal and temporal approaches.

Conclusion: The dataset addresses a critical gap and will be made publicly available to support advancements in flood mapping and analysis.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach to create adversarial images that deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) while maintaining image quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of generating adversarial images capable of attacking MLLMs effectively while avoiding significant quality degradation in the clean image.

Method: The authors developed the AGD approach, which injects adversarial-guided noise in the reverse diffusion process of a diffusion model. This ensures the adversarial signal spans the full-frequency spectrum and remains robust against defenses like low-pass filtering.

Result: Experiments show that AGD achieves superior attack performance compared to existing methods and exhibits enhanced robustness to various defenses.

Conclusion: AGD offers an effective and robust method for producing adversarial images, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both attack efficacy and defense resilience.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a solution for addressing the challenge of food crystal agglomeration detection using supervised learning, combining classification and segmentation-based models, and validates them against manual annotation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in detecting agglomeration due to transparency of water bonding and limited perspective in 2D microscopic images.

Method: Proposed a supervised baseline model for pseudo-label generation and an instance classification model performing pixel-wise segmentation, supported by a post-processing module for improved accuracy.

Result: Achieved accurate agglomeration classification, better size distribution prediction, and successful evaluation under two manual annotation confidence levels.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves agglomeration detection and predictions, outperforming existing methods under diverse confidence levels.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight and precise road damage detection model, YOLO-ROC, which enhances multi-scale feature extraction and reduces computational demands, achieving improved detection, especially for small targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of inadequate multi-scale feature extraction and high computational demands in existing deep-learning-based road damage detection models, which affect the detection of small-scale damage and real-time efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes YOLO-ROC, integrating the BMS-SPPF module to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce the computational complexity and parameter count.

Result: YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of 67.6%, surpasses YOLOv8n by 2.11%, improves small-target detection by 16.8% in the D40 category, and exhibits strong generalization with reduced model size (2.0 MB).

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that YOLO-ROC is a high-precision and efficient model for road damage detection, particularly excelling in detecting small-scale damage while being computationally lightweight.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Result: The systems showcase detection capabilities for harmful AR content and highlight challenges for further advancement in this domain.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of creating a scalable and user-aligned system for AR safety, while outlining future directions for improving AR content assessment and detection technologies.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on Generalized Semi-Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GSemi-FSCIL), rethinking traditional Semi-FSCIL to include a broader set of unlabeled data and proposing an ALDC method for addressing this broader challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make Semi-FSCIL more applicable to real-world scenarios by broadening the unlabeled data source to include both base and previously seen novel classes.

Method: Proposed an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy, which uses base class samples dynamically to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes.

Result: The ALDC method sets new state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper redefines Semi-FSCIL to better align with realistic applications and introduces an effective ALDC strategy that successfully addresses the challenges of GSemi-FSCIL.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: RL-QR is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve query rewriting for specific retrievers in RAG systems without human annotations, demonstrating significant retrieval performance gains in text-only and multi-modal database contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing query formulation for diverse, unstructured real-world documents is challenging, and current methods in retrieval-augmented generation require scalable solutions without relying on human-annotated datasets.

Method: RL-QR synthesizes scenario-question pairs and uses Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) for training retriever-specific query rewriters in text-only and multi-modal database contexts.

Result: RL-QR exhibited notable improvements in retrieval: 11% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG systems and 9% gain for lexical retrievers, but struggled with semantic and hybrid retrievers due to training misalignments.

Conclusion: RL-QR presents a scalable and annotation-free query optimization solution for RAG systems, showing promise for real-world use, though further refinement is needed for semantic and hybrid retrieval settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first comprehensive diffusion MRI-derived cranial nerve atlas for automated nerve pathway mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of mapping detailed cranial nerve pathways due to anatomical complexity and surrounding structures.

Method: A multi-stage fiber clustering approach was applied to approximately 1 million streamlines from 50 human subjects to generate the atlas.

Result: The atlas showed high spatial accuracy with manual annotations across multiple datasets, capable of identifying 8 fiber bundles linked to 5 cranial nerve pairs.

Conclusion: The cranial nerve atlas enhances understanding of brain structure through advanced visualization and automated pathway mapping, with potential clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews and compares object tracking methods—including Siamese-based, discriminative, and transformer-based approaches—highlighting the progress and features of transformer-based trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of object tracking in challenging scenarios involving occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance changes, and provide a comprehensive review of major tracking paradigms.

Method: The authors categorize and compare existing tracking methods and benchmarks, focusing particularly on transformer-based trackers, with qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Result: The study identifies design principles, innovations, and limitations across tracking paradigms, offering unified comparisons visually and in tabular form.

Conclusion: Transformer-based tracking methods have become increasingly dominant, driven by their robust handling of spatio-temporal dynamics in complex conditions.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [117] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Time Series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a new evaluation metric for transforming time series into images for analyzing structural dynamics, along with the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), an innovative training loss to improve temporal structure modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current numerical metrics like MSE fail to capture the geometric structure of time series data, which is crucial for understanding temporal dynamics in applications like forecasting.

Method: The proposed TGSI metric transforms time series into images to analyze their geometric structure. Additionally, a multi-component training loss function (SATL) is introduced, involving a first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss, and perceptual feature loss to better model structural dynamics.

Result: Experiments using multiple datasets show that the method improves both point-wise accuracy (MSE) and structural evaluation (TGSI) without adding computational cost during inference.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap in structural modeling of time series, providing a comprehensive framework through TGSI and SATL that improves both evaluation and training metrics.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

### [118] [Learning Semantic-Aware Threshold for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Partial Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23263)
*Haoxian Ruan,Zhihua Xu,Zhijing Yang,Guang Ma,Jieming Xie,Changxiang Fan,Tianshui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm to improve multi-label image recognition with partial labels by creating adaptive category-specific thresholds, leading to better performance on datasets like COCO and VG-200.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-label image recognition with partial labels fail due to relying on fixed thresholds, leading to inaccurate pseudo-labels. This motivates the need for dynamic and adaptive thresholds.

Method: The SATL algorithm calculates score distributions for each category's positive and negative samples and dynamically updates thresholds during training. Additionally, a differential ranking loss is used to enhance discrimination between positive and negative scores.

Result: Experiments showcase that the SATL approach achieves significant performance improvements on large multi-label datasets, including Microsoft COCO and VG-200, particularly in label-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic, category-specific threshold learning through SATL effectively outperforms traditional fixed-threshold methods, providing a robust solution for multi-label image recognition with partial labels.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

### [119] [PixNerd: Pixel Neural Field Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23268)
*Shuai Wang,Ziteng Gao,Chenhui Zhu,Weilin Huang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PixelNerd, a diffusion model that eliminates the need for pre-trained variational autoencoders by modeling patch-wise decoding with neural fields, achieving competitive FID and benchmark scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The two-stage training paradigm using VAEs in diffusion transformers introduces errors and decoding artifacts, and solutions reverting to pixel space are complex and costly.

Method: PixelNerd models patch-wise decoding using neural fields in a single-scale, single-stage, end-to-end efficient manner, avoiding VAEs and cascade pipelines.

Result: PixelNerd achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$, 2.84 FID on ImageNet $512\times512$, 0.73 on GenEval, and 80.9 on DPG benchmarks.

Conclusion: PixelNerd offers an efficient alternative to existing diffusion models, improving performance and simplifying methodology without relying on pre-trained VAEs.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

### [120] [Towards Affordable Tumor Segmentation and Visualization for 3D Breast MRI Using SAM2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23272)
*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the adaptation of SAM2 for low-cost, minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI scans, finding promise in its zero-shot, center-outward strategy capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high costs, proprietary restrictions, and infrastructure demands of commercial medical AI, which limit accessibility in low- and middle-income countries.

Method: The study uses a single bounding box annotation on one slice of a breast MRI, with three segmentation propagation strategies (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward). Performance of the SAM2 model is then tested and analyzed under minimal supervision.

Result: Center-outward slice-wise propagation proved to achieve the most consistent and accurate 3D segmentations. The SAM2 model showed strong performance despite not being designed for volumetric medical data.

Conclusion: General-purpose models like SAM2 can effectively support affordable and accessible 3D medical image analysis in resource-constrained environments, highlighting their potential as an alternative for expensive medical AI systems.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

### [121] [iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277)
*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iLRM, an efficient feed-forward model for scalable 3D reconstruction using iterative 3D Gaussian refinement, achieving superior quality and speed compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art 3D modeling methods face severe scalability issues, mainly due to high computational costs caused by fully attentive multi-view image token interactions.

Method: The proposed iLRM approach incorporates three principles: decoupling scene representation from input-view images, implementing a two-stage attention scheme to lessen computational demands, and integrating high-resolution details at each layer for improved fidelity.

Result: Experiments on RE10K and DL3DV datasets show that iLRM surpasses previous methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. It demonstrates exceptional scalability by efficiently utilizing a large number of input views.

Conclusion: iLRM establishes itself as the superior method for scalable and high-quality 3D reconstruction thanks to its efficiency, scalability, and ability to leverage iterative refinement.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a vision-based pipeline combining RGB-D sensing, deep learning, and occlusion recovery techniques to estimate strawberry mass under field conditions with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address challenges in accurately estimating the mass of strawberries grown in fields due to occlusions and varying poses, which hinder non-destructive and real-time monitoring.

Method: The method employs YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation, CycleGAN for occluded region completion, tilt-angle correction for refined projection area, and a polynomial regression model to estimate mass from geometric features.

Result: The system achieved mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded ones. CycleGAN significantly outperformed LaMa in occlusion recovery, with higher PAR and IoU scores.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes limitations of traditional methods, providing an effective solution for automated strawberry harvesting and yield monitoring, even under challenging occlusion conditions.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP extends CLIP to support image reconstruction, generation, and editing through a unified tokenizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods degrade comprehension performance or require additional components for generation and reconstruction tasks.

Method: Two-stage training scheme, self-distillation strategy, and a dual-condition architecture connecting MLLM and diffusion transformer.

Result: UniLIP surpasses previous unified models in text-to-image generation and image editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniLIP broadens CLIP's capabilities, offering competitive performance in both understanding and creative generation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BLiM, a novel bidirectional likelihood estimation framework for text-video retrieval, coupled with Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) to reduce candidate bias and improve retrieval accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address candidate prior bias in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) during text-video retrieval, which favors inherently high-prior candidates over more relevant query matches.

Method: The authors propose BLiM, a bidirectional likelihood estimation framework combining query and candidate likelihoods, along with Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) to recalibrate scores and reduce bias without additional training.

Result: On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, BLiM with CPN outperformed prior models by an average of 6.4 R@1, showcasing enhanced query-candidate relevance and robust performance.

Conclusion: BLiM with CPN mitigates candidate prior bias effectively, surpassing state-of-the-art models in text-video retrieval and demonstrating adaptability across other multi-modal tasks to improve visual understanding.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGNet, a large-scale benchmark dataset for robotic grasping with affordance segmentation, and presents AffordanceNet, a reasoning-based grasping framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robotic grasping systems by enhancing reasoning-based affordance prediction in open-world scenarios, addressing limitations in current studies.

Method: Developed RAGNet—a benchmark dataset of 273k images with annotations and reasoning instructions, combined with AffordanceNet—a model integrating affordance maps and visual-language pre-training.

Result: AffordanceNet demonstrated superior generalization abilities in affordance segmentation and real-robot manipulation tasks, outperforming current methods.

Conclusion: The presented benchmark and framework advance the field of robotic grasping with broad potential in open-world applications.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark framework to evaluate structural robustness in document layout predictions, addressing limitations of traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies of conventional metrics like IoU and mAP in identifying structural errors (e.g., region merging, splitting, and missing content) in document layout analysis.

Method: LED establishes a benchmark with eight error types and three tasks (error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification). A synthetic dataset (LED-Dataset) is created by injecting structural errors into DLA models.

Result: Experimental results show that LED effectively assesses structural robustness in layout predictions, revealing modality biases and trade-offs overlooked by conventional metrics.

Conclusion: LED provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating document layout analysis models, enabling better insights into their structural understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Hanshen Zhu,Zhen Zhu,Kaile Zhang,Yiming Gong,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new three-step pipeline for geometric image editing, emphasizing object transformation, source inpainting, and target refinement. The approach utilizes a training-free diffusion method called FreeFine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based editing methods handle editing subtasks in a single step, which struggles with large or complex transformations. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The paper proposes a decoupled pipeline for editing which separates operations into object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement, leveraging a training-free diffusion methodology, "FreeFine."

Result: FreeFine demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and editing precision, particularly for challenging transformations, as validated through the new GeoBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Separating the task into a modular pipeline and using the FreeFine method leads to more effective and precise editing capabilities under complex conditions.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are
available at: https://github.com/CIawevy/FreeFine

*Xihang Hu,Fuming Sun,Jiazhe Liu,Feilong Xu,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-SAM, a highly efficient framework for Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) that excels with minimal labeled data by using dynamic pseudo-labeling and hybrid prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of high annotation costs, prediction bias, and error propagation in SSCOD tasks, while also overcoming the computational burdens of multi-network architectures.

Method: ST-SAM employs a dynamic self-training strategy to enhance a single-model architecture. It uses pseudo-labels that are filtered and expanded dynamically. Additionally, it incorporates domain-specific hybrid prompts to maximally leverage the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data on COD benchmarks. It surpasses current SSCOD methods and matches fully supervised methods while using a single network, free from specific model or loss function dependencies.

Conclusion: ST-SAM sets a new benchmark for annotation efficiency in SSCOD tasks, offering a lightweight, scalable solution. Its approach minimizes reliance on labeled data and overcomes traditional SSCOD limitations, making it a versatile framework.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

### [129] [PriorFusion: Unified Integration of Priors for Robust Road Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23309)
*Xuewei Tang,Mengmeng Yang,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Le Cui,Mingshang Luo,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Diange Yang,Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriorFusion, a framework leveraging structured priors for precise road element perception in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing road perception methods fail in complex environments due to insufficient use of inherent structured priors, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: The authors propose PriorFusion, integrating semantic, geometric, and generative priors. Key features include instance-aware attention mechanisms, shape template spaces, and diffusion-based frameworks for better prediction.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets highlight improved perception accuracy, particularly in challenging scenarios. Visualizations show enhanced coherence and regularity in road element predictions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, utilizing structured priors to boost autonomous road perception technologies.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines linear merging of models in continual learning, finding that merging improves shared knowledge but loses task-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore how model merging impacts knowledge retention and enhancement in a continual learning context.

Method: The authors use computer vision experiments with controlled visual cues to analyze the effects of merging models.

Result: Merging models preserves or enhances shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge, and incremental training leads to better merging performance than parallel training.

Conclusion: Model merging in continual learning is effective for shared knowledge but struggles with task-specific retention; incremental training offers better results.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

### [131] [The Cow of Rembrandt - Analyzing Artistic Prompt Interpretation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23313)
*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how text-to-image diffusion models understand and differentiate between content and style in artwork generation, without explicit training guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the internal representation of content and style concepts in text-to-image diffusion models, given their lack of explicit supervisory signals for this distinction during training.

Method: The authors utilize cross-attention heatmaps to link generated image regions with specific prompt tokens, isolating the influence of content-describing and style-describing tokens.

Result: The study reveals that these models show varying degrees of content-style separation, with content tokens influencing object-related regions and style tokens affecting background and texture areas.

Conclusion: Diffusion models exhibit an emergent understanding of content-style separation without explicit guidance, enhancing our comprehension of generative models’ internal representations of artistic concepts.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

### [132] [Impact of Hyperparameter Optimization on the Accuracy of Lightweight Deep Learning Models for Real-Time Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23315)
*Vineet Kumar Rakesh,Soumya Mazumdar,Tapas Samanta,Sarbajit Pal,Amitabha Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares seven lightweight deep learning models for real-time image classification, analyzing hyperparameter impacts and optimizing accuracy under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications by exploring how hyperparameters influence model accuracy and performance.

Method: The study trains seven efficient architectures using consistent training settings on the ImageNet-1K dataset, conducts an ablation study on key hyperparameters, and evaluates both classification accuracy and practical deployment metrics.

Result: Key findings show that cosine learning rate decay and adaptable batch sizes improve accuracy and convergence speed with low latency. RepVGG-A2 achieved a balance between accuracy and inference performance, surpassing 80% Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: The research offers actionable guidance on selecting and tuning lightweight deep learning models for optimized performance in real-time imaging tasks.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA introduces a reconstruction-based framework focused on pruning visual tokens for autonomous driving, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving due to long visual tokens, aiming to improve computational performance while maintaining decision-making accuracy.

Method: FastDriveVLA employs ReconPruner, a visual token pruner centered on pixel reconstruction and adversarial foreground-background strategies. It also leverages the nuScenes-FG dataset for training.

Result: FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark, demonstrating effective pruning across varying ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed FastDriveVLA framework improves computational efficiency for autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance in decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

*Yiming Yang,Hongbin Lin,Yueru Luo,Suzhong Fu,Chao Zheng,Xinrui Yan,Shuqi Mei,Kun Tang,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASTopoWM enhances lane topology reasoning by incorporating latent world models, effectively addressing temporal propagation issues and pose estimation failures for autonomous driving systems, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lane topology reasoning methods struggle with effectively utilizing temporal information, leading to limitations in detection and reasoning performance.

Method: FASTopoWM introduces a fast-slow reasoning framework with latent world models, enabling parallel supervision for both historical and new queries. It utilizes latent query and BEV world models conditioned on latent actions to enhance temporal propagation.

Result: FASTopoWM demonstrates superior performance in lane detection (37.4% mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% OLS) compared to previous methods on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides significant improvements in temporal lane topology reasoning, offering an effective solution to challenges in autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

*Yingkai Wang,Yaoyao Zhu,Xiuding Cai,Yuhao Xiao,Haotian Wu,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a domain generalization framework to improve medical image segmentation robustness across diverse clinical domains using implicit feature perturbations and adaptive consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation models suffer from performance degradation when applied to unseen clinical domains due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols.

Method: The framework introduces domain statistics-guided implicit feature perturbations through a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler. It also utilizes an adaptive consistency constraint selectively applied when feature adjustments degrade segmentation performance.

Result: Experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing domain generalization approaches, achieving robust and generalizable segmentation across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shifts in medical image segmentation, enhancing the robustness and clinical applicability of segmentation models.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

### [136] [Contrastive Learning-Driven Traffic Sign Perception: Multi-Modal Fusion of Text and Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23331)
*Qiang Lu,Waikit Xiu,Xiying Li,Shenyu Hu,Shengbo Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in traffic sign recognition for autonomous driving by proposing a two-stage framework that combines open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. It excels in handling data imbalance and small, multi-scale target recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic sign recognition technologies struggle with long-tail dataset distributions and the difficulty of recognizing small-scale signs with significant variations, both crucial for driving safety.

Method: Proposed a two-stage framework: (1) NanoVerse YOLO model with RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv for traffic sign detection targeting small, multi-scale objects. (2) TSR-MCL for classification, utilizing contrastive learning between Vision Transformer features and rule-based BERT embeddings.

Result: Achieved 78.4% mAP on the long-tail TT100K detection task, with classification accuracy of 91.8% and recall of 88.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method showcases superior accuracy and generalization in detecting and classifying traffic signs, making it highly practical for real-world, open-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

*Xingyue Peng,Yuandong Lyu,Lang Zhang,Jian Zhu,Songtao Wang,Jiaxin Deng,Songxin Lu,Weiliang Ma,Dangen She,Peng Jia,XianPeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for road surface reconstruction in autonomous driving improves robustness against occlusions, visual clutter, and appearance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for road surface reconstruction struggle with occlusions, visual clutter, and lighting/weather changes, compromising their reliability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels, semantic-guided color enhancement, planar-adapted Gaussian representation, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware HSV color correction.

Result: The method achieves visually consistent and geometrically faithful road reconstructions, outperforming previous works especially under complex real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable and robust solution for road surface reconstruction, significantly advancing performance in urban autonomous driving environments.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

*Ahmet Can Ömercikoğlu,Mustafa Mansur Yönügül,Pakize Erdoğmuş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how image resolution affects the performance of three face detection models (YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN) and highlights YOLOv11's superiority in detection accuracy at higher resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenges posed by low-resolution imagery on face detection performance, which is critical for applications like surveillance and biometric authentication.

Method: The authors conducted evaluations on three face detection models using the WIDER FACE dataset across multiple resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640). Metrics like precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time were utilized.

Result: YOLOv11 achieves the highest detection accuracy, particularly at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 performs better in recall, and MTCNN excels in landmark localization but is slower.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into the suitability of face detection models under varying resolution requirements, with YOLOv11 being the most accurate at higher resolutions.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large dataset, THQA-10K, for assessing the quality of AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) and proposes a state-of-the-art objective quality assessment method to evaluate AGTHs' performance and expose distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges of quality and distortions in AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs), a growing field in digital human media, and to fill the gap in comprehensive studies on this topic.

Method: The authors created the THQA-10K dataset using 12 T2I models and 14 advanced talkers, evaluated over 14 prompts, with subjective ratings from volunteers and introduced an objective quality assessment method leveraging first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency.

Result: The dataset includes 10,457 AGTHs, and the proposed objective assessment method achieved state-of-the-art performance in AGTH quality evaluation.

Conclusion: The study provides a significant benchmark with the THQA-10K dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of an objective quality measurement method in advancing the AGTH evaluation field.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the evolution of design patterns in computer vision through key pivotal advancements.

Method: Systematic review and comparative analysis of foundational architectures and methodologies in computer vision, including ResNet, Vision Transformer, GANs, Latent Diffusion Models, DINO, and Masked Autoencoders.

Result: Highlights landmark advancements such as residual learning, attention mechanisms, adversarial training, latent space denoising, self-distillation, and masked reconstruction for vision models.

Conclusion: Modern computer vision has been shaped by innovations ranging from deep architectures to generative frameworks and scalable pre-training techniques, enabling robust and efficient visual recognition and generation.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Short-LVLM, designed to address inefficiencies in compressing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for enhanced functionality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) face practical challenges due to their massive size and computational demand, and while NLP-based layer pruning offers some promise, its direct application to LVLMs has proven ineffective due to modality differences.

Method: The authors identified issues such as non-essential vision-language tokens and inter-layer feature gaps in LVLMs. They proposed Short-LVLM, a framework to select important VL tokens and address feature mismatch between layers, improving pruning effectiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated Short-LVLM's superior trade-off between performance and efficiency, as well as its advantages of being training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Conclusion: Short-LVLM successfully compresses LVLMs in a manner that overcomes traditional challenges, offering a scalable and efficient solution for broader practical deployment.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid deep learning model combining Mamba and Transformer to enhance semi-dense feature matching between images with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address the high computational costs associated with the Transformer-based attention mechanism in learning-based feature matching methods.

Method: VMatcher integrates Mamba's Selective State-Space Model for linear complexity with the Transformer's attention mechanism. It explores hierarchical architectures and efficient configurations.

Result: The model achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while being computationally cost-effective, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: VMatcher sets new benchmarks in feature matching by combining efficiency and high performance, proving its suitability and robustness for practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniEmo, a unified framework for emotional understanding and image generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between emotional understanding and generation, recognizing their complementary nature to enhance both tasks simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose hierarchical emotional understanding with learnable expert queries and fuse these features to guide a diffusion model for emotion-evoking image generation. They also introduce emotional correlation coefficients, emotional condition loss, and a novel data filtering algorithm.

Result: Experimental results show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotional understanding and generation.

Conclusion: By unifying and jointly training emotional understanding and generation with dual feedback mechanisms, the proposed UniEmo framework improves performance for both tasks effectively.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

### [144] [Multi-Prompt Progressive Alignment for Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23373)
*Haoran Chen,Zexiao Wang,Haidong Cao,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream tasks in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), addressing issues like noisy pseudo-labels and multi-source domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existent methods using CLIP for UDA struggle with noisy and hard-to-classify data, leading to error propagation, especially in multi-source scenarios with diverse domain gaps.

Method: The proposed MP^2A method progressively trains CLIP, starting with high-confidence target samples and gradually adding harder ones, improving alignment and reducing noise impact.

Result: MP^2A demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on UDA benchmarks including ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet, showcasing its robustness.

Conclusion: Progressive alignment mitigates noise and confirmation bias, aiding robust convergence and the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeRF-GS, a hybrid framework that optimizes both Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), addressing 3DGS's limitations for superior 3D scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of 3DGS, such as sensitivity to initialization, weak spatial awareness, and lack of robust inter-Gaussian correlations, and to explore the complementary potential of combining NeRF with 3DGS.

Method: The framework aligns spatial features of NeRF with 3DGS, jointly optimizing them using shared 3D spatial data and optimizing residual vectors for implicit features and Gaussian positions to improve 3DGS's adaptability.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that NeRF-GS outperforms existing methods and sets a new benchmark for 3D scene representation.

Conclusion: NeRF-GS demonstrates that NeRF and 3DGS are complementary techniques, offering state-of-the-art results and paving the way for hybrid frameworks in efficient 3D modeling.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

### [146] [AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402)
*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGA framework captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports using a grouping mechanism that avoids the need for external negatives, enabling improved image-text retrieval and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods neglect the structured semantics in clinical reports and struggle with limited negative samples in small-scale medical datasets.

Method: AGA uses adaptive grouping thresholds and sparse similarity matrices to form visual and language groups, aligning tokens with group representations via a novel alignment loss.

Result: AGA demonstrates superior performance in image-text retrieval and classification tasks across multiple datasets, including zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Conclusion: AGA effectively addresses limitations in medical vision-language task frameworks, showcasing the potential to improve clinical tasks by capturing structured semantics dynamically.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

*Lemar Abdi,Francisco Caetano,Amaan Valiuddin,Christiaan Viviers,Hamdi Joudeh,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reconstruction-free method for unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using Stein score-based diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently on medical imaging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing generative approaches for OOD detection, which are computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining when inlier data is updated, particularly in medical imaging scenarios.

Method: The proposed method utilizes forward diffusion trajectories in Stein score-based denoising diffusion models (SBDDM), capturing trajectory curvature via the Stein score. This enables anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps and eliminates reconstruction or retraining burdens.

Result: The model generalizes effectively across multiple benchmarks (Near-OOD and Far-OOD) and achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, with relative improvements of up to 10.43% and 18.10%, respectively. It is computationally efficient for real-time usage.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time, reliable OOD detection in medical imaging, overcoming existing computational and flexibility challenges.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning system that uses hyperspectral imaging to detect and quantify honey adulteration with sugar syrup, achieving 96.39% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated and accurate alternative to chemical-based methods for detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup.

Method: The system involves two subsystems: one for classifying the honey's floral source using LDA and KNN, and another for detecting and quantifying sugar syrup adulteration using the same techniques. Hyperspectral imaging data is used for feature extraction.

Result: The proposed system achieves an overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39% on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset.

Conclusion: The system provides a reliable machine learning-based alternative for honey adulteration detection, eliminating the need for traditional chemical-based methods.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing conventional linear projection layers in art style classification frameworks with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to improve modeling of complex stylistic interactions, achieving superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art style classification is challenging due to limited labeled datasets and complex stylistic feature interactions. Current self-supervised methods struggle to capture global compositional context.

Method: The authors enhance the dual-teacher knowledge distillation framework by integrating KANs for projection and prediction instead of traditional MLP layers. This enables better modeling of nonlinear feature correlations.

Result: Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k datasets show improved Top-1 accuracy and better linear probe results using KANs compared to the base framework.

Conclusion: KANs effectively disentangle complex style manifolds and improve performance in art style classification, demonstrating their utility in computational aesthetics.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

*Martin Hermann Paul Fuchs,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyCASS, a model for hyperspectral image compression balancing spectral and spatial dimensions using learning-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of comprehensive analysis of spectral and spatial compression in hyperspectral image (HSI) archiving.

Method: HyCASS uses modules based on convolutional layers and transformer blocks for adaptable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions.

Result: HyCASS outperforms existing models and provides guidelines for balancing compression ratios for hyperspectral images.

Conclusion: HyCASS provides an effective and adaptable solution for hyperspectral image compression, filling a gap in the learning-based HSI compression analysis landscape.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of machine learning in predicting ailments from chest X-rays and improve healthcare diagnostics.

Method: Two machine learning models, baseline CNN and DenseNet-121, were implemented and analyzed using 5824 chest X-ray images.

Result: Both models demonstrated high efficacy in binary classification, with DenseNet-121 showing better focus on critical image regions using class activation mapping.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 outperforms the baseline CNN in diagnosing diseases from chest X-rays by effectively utilizing essential image regions.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated Learning is adapted for human pose estimation, tackling 'resolution-drift' through Resolution-Adaptive Federated Learning (RAF) using heatmap-based knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the underexplored challenge of 'resolution-drift' in applying Federated Learning to non-classification tasks like human pose estimation.

Method: Proposed Resolution-Adaptive Federated Learning (RAF) uses multi-resolution knowledge distillation to enhance resolution robustness and mitigate performance degradation.

Result: RAF effectively addresses resolution drift, improves performance significantly, and is compatible with existing Federated Learning frameworks.

Conclusion: RAF demonstrates potential for broader application in tasks requiring high-resolution spatial details beyond human pose estimation.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset (CST Anti-UAV) for tracking tiny UAVs in complex thermal infrared scenes is introduced, highlighting the limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs present public safety and privacy challenges, necessitating advanced tracking solutions that current datasets fail to adequately support due to lack of diversity and scene complexity.

Method: A thermal infrared dataset named CST Anti-UAV was created, incorporating 220 sequences and 240,000+ bounding box annotations, with rich attributes and manual frame-level annotations for evaluating tracking methods.

Result: 20 existing Single Object Tracking (SOT) methods were tested on the dataset, with the best performing method achieving only 35.92% accuracy, revealing significant challenges.

Conclusion: The dataset identifies shortcomings in current UAV tracking methods and highlights the need for advancements in the domain while providing a valuable resource to drive future research.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Conclusion: 3D-R1 successfully enhances reasoning and generalization for 3D VLMs and can be a valuable contribution to the field of 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data

Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%

Result: The proposed model achieves 93.63% accuracy in localization and 87.48% accuracy in anomaly detection, outperforming current single-task models while using just 1 million parameters.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying efficient AI models in video capsule endoscopy devices, marking a significant improvement in extending battery life and advancing clinical applications.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of bridging the gap between synthetic and real-captured 3D data for real-world 3D visual tasks.

Method: A two-stage depth diffusion framework involving first-stage finetuning of Stable-Diffusion to produce coarse depth followed by a second-stage refinement targeting areas of deviation identified by a 3D discriminator.

Result: Extensive experiments highlight improved performance in real-world 3D visual tasks using simulated data from their method, achieving high similarity to real-captured 3D data.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real successfully advances 3D data simulation, proving effective both in improving task performance and simulating realistic 3D patterns.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

*Timing Li,Bing Cao,Jiahe Feng,Haifang Cao,Qinghau Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel image registration method called Hy-CycleAlign, which operates in hyperbolic space to improve cross-modal image fusion and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image registration techniques in Euclidean space struggle to handle cross-modal misalignment, resulting in poor fusion quality.

Method: The proposed Hy-CycleAlign framework uses hyperbolic space for registration, featuring a dual-path cyclic structure with forward and backward registration networks for geometric consistency. It also integrates a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module for better alignment.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in alignment and fusion quality in experiments with misaligned multi-modal images.

Conclusion: Exploration in hyperbolic space provides more sensitive and effective solutions for multi-modal image registration, establishing a new direction for this field.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

*David A. Kelly,Akchunya Chanchal,Nathan Blake*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using minimal sufficient pixel sets to analyze the behavior of image classification models, revealing architecture-specific patterns and links between pixel set size and misclassifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance our understanding of how image classification models make decisions, addressing the limited interpretability of such models despite their statistical accuracy.

Method: The researchers utilize minimal sufficient pixel sets to evaluate a model's 'concentration,' analyzing pixel position, overlap, and size across models to identify patterns.

Result: The study found statistically significant differences in concentration among architectures, particularly between ConvNext and EVA, and observed that misclassified images require larger pixel sets.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that minimal sufficient pixel sets offer valuable insights into model behavior, aiding in understanding differences between architectures and misclassification tendencies.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

### [160] [ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23543)
*Gopika Sudhakaran,Hikaru Shindo,Patrick Schramowski,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Kristian Kersting,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ART, a framework for improving Visual Relation Detection (VRD) in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using instruction tuning and adaptive sampling, achieving superior generalization and handling unseen relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VRD models and prompt-tuned vision-language methods struggle with generalizing beyond trained relationships or handling novel and complex relations.

Method: ART transforms VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format, employs adaptive sampling, and tunes VLMs to focus on informative relations for relation classification tasks.

Result: ART significantly outperforms baseline VRD methods, demonstrates the capability to infer unseen relations, and showcases practical value in scene segmentation.

Conclusion: ART effectively enhances VRD generalization in VLMs via instruction tuning, enabling the model to handle diverse and complex relations, improving on previous limitations.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

*Yung-Hsu Yang,Luigi Piccinelli,Mattia Segu,Siyuan Li,Rui Huang,Yuqian Fu,Marc Pollefeys,Hermann Blum,Zuria Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for monocular 3D object detection in open-set settings is introduced, overcoming challenges posed by diverse environments and object categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-world applications where environments and object categories differ from the training set, enabling broader usability of monocular 3D object detection.

Method: The authors proposed '3D-MOOD', an end-to-end approach that combines open-set 2D detection with 3D bounding box generation, integrating object queries conditioned by geometry prior and using canonical image space for cross-dataset training.

Result: Evaluation on closed-set and open-set benchmarks shows that the approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 3D-MOOD expands the capabilities of monocular 3D object detection to open-set scenarios, providing robust performance and generalization for real-world applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

### [162] [Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields for Privacy-Preserving Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23569)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Gabriela Csurka,Torsten Sattler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs) for accurate, privacy-preserving visual localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for accurate and privacy-aware camera pose estimation in known environments.

Method: The method proposes GSFFs by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting and an implicit feature field. It leverages contrastive learning to align 3D feature fields with 2D encoders while incorporating structure-informed clustering for representation learning.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GSFFs effectively enhance accuracy and privacy in visual localization, leveraging 3D geometry and feature clustering.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

*Sobhan Asasi,Mohamed Ilyas Lakhal,Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BeyondGloss introduces a gloss-free SLT framework leveraging VideoLLMs, using innovative methods to overcome limitations in modeling hand motion temporally and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in SLT including bridging visual-linguistic modality gaps and capturing hand motion variations.

Method: Introduces VideoLLMs and uses fine-grained textual descriptions of hand motion aligned with video features, distillation of hand-specific representations, and contrastive loss for reducing modality gaps.

Result: State-of-the-art performance achieved on Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of gloss-free SLT leveraging advanced methods. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yaoye Zhu,Zhe Wang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MamV2XCalib, a novel infrastructure camera calibration method using vehicle-side LiDAR, eliminating manual efforts and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current roadside camera calibration for autonomous vehicle systems is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and disrupts traffic flow. There is a need for an efficient, automatic, and reliable calibration method.

Method: MamV2XCalib utilizes vehicles with LiDAR to drive near roadside cameras and proposes a targetless calibration method that combines multi-scale features and 4D correlation volume to align LiDAR point clouds with roadside images. It incorporates a temporal model, Mamba, to address issues like occlusions and viewpoint differences.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated superior calibration performance on real-world V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X datasets with robustness and fewer parameters compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib effectively automates infrastructure camera calibration in V2X systems, offering enhanced precision and robustness without manual intervention.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

### [165] [MoGA: 3D Generative Avatar Prior for Monocular Gaussian Avatar Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23597)
*Zijian Dong,Longteng Duan,Jie Song,Michael J. Black,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGA presents a method for producing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars from a single image, addressing limitations of prior methods like 3D inconsistencies and blurred details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of unseen visual details and ensure consistent, realistic 3D reconstructions from single-view images.

Method: MoGA integrates a generative avatar model with 2D diffusion model views, leveraging model inversion and latent space projections while enforcing 3D appearance and geometric constraints.

Result: Experiments demonstrate MoGA outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving high fidelity in 3D avatar reconstructions and generalizing to real-world settings.

Conclusion: MoGA ensures 3D realism and consistency, producing animatable avatars with enhanced geometric and appearance fidelity compared to earlier methodologies.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

*Yuchen Zhou,Yan Luo,Xiangang Wang,Xingjian Gu,Mingzhou Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a streamlined 2D approach for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing accuracy and real-time inference speed in 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving systems is a pressing challenge.

Method: The paper introduces a pure 2D directional approach using sliced 3D voxel features and a directional attention mechanism to preserve vertical geometric data and efficiently extract geometric information.

Result: The proposed method achieves a balance between mIoU (39.3%) and inference speed (27.7 FPS), and on edge devices, it maintains real-time feasibility at 14.8 FPS.

Conclusion: This approach successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [167] [Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601)
*Xin Li,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vcamba, a novel approach to video camouflaged object detection using integrated frequency and spatial features for enhanced detection accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus primarily on spatial appearance features, which struggle with high similarity between foreground and background. Frequency features can overcome these limitations by enhancing feature representation and capturing motion through dynamic variations.

Method: Vcamba is built on spatio-frequency motion perception, using modules like RFVSS for multi-scale spatial feature extraction, AFE for semantic consistency in frequency learning, SLMP and FLMP for motion perception in spatial and frequency domains, and SFMF for unified motion representation.

Result: Vcamba achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets, with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency and spatial features enables efficient and accurate video camouflaged object detection, validating Vcamba's design and approach.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the MIDI-B Challenge aimed at benchmarking de-identification tools for medical imaging following HIPAA regulations while preserving essential metadata for research. It involved synthetic PHI/PII insertion into real radiology images and achieved high accuracy (97.91%-99.93%) in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective de-identification (deID) of health information in medical images for public sharing, while ensuring metadata preservation for downstream research and adhering to legal privacy standards.

Method: The team designed the MIDI-B Challenge with three phases (training, validation, and test) using DICOM images augmented with synthetic PHI/PII. Participants refined their tools, and success was measured by calculating the percentage of correct deID actions.

Result: Ten teams successfully completed the test phase, achieving deID accuracy scores between 97.91% and 99.93%, employing open-source/proprietary tools, large language models, and OCR techniques.

Conclusion: The MIDI-B Challenge demonstrated that high accuracy levels in image deID are achievable through a structured benchmarking framework. It also provided insights into methods and tools effective in de-identification, aiding compliance and metadata preservation in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl introduces a modular framework for image generation that resolves issues in generalization and adaptation costs seen in current models by factorizing ControlNet and leveraging dynamic gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from problems in existing image-to-image generation models, including poor generalization and high adaptation costs when dealing with novel input conditions.

Method: The paper proposes DivControl, utilizing SVD to factorize ControlNet into modular components, and a dynamic gate for routing condition-specific information. Additional techniques include representation alignment loss for improving fidelity and training efficiency.

Result: DivControl exhibits superior controllability, scalability, and transferability, with a significant reduction in training costs (36.4x), outperforming state-of-the-art models in basic conditions as well as zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: DivControl offers a scalable and modular approach that overcomes the limitations of current models, making it an efficient and reliable framework for diverse generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

*Dustin Carrión-Ojeda,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT) for improved few-shot classification and segmentation, especially for small objects, using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods excel in FS-CS tasks but face challenges with small object accuracy and inefficient use of annotations.

Method: Proposed EMAT incorporates memory-efficient masked attention, a learnable downscaling method, and parameter efficiency. It also suggests new evaluation settings leveraging available annotations.

Result: EMAT achieves SOTA results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets with four times fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: EMAT improves FS-CS outcomes, particularly for small objects, while addressing parameter efficiency and practical annotation usage in evaluations.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

*Changqing Xu,Ziqiang Yang,Yi Liu,Xinfang Liao,Guiqi Mo,Hao Zeng,Yintang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Forward-Forward training framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to eliminate gradient approximation challenges while improving energy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Spiking Neural Networks is notoriously difficult due to their non-differentiability and the substantial computational burden of backpropagation methods, especially for edge-device deployment.

Method: A gradient approximation-free training framework based on the Forward-Forward (FF) approach is proposed. It treats spiking activations as black boxes and introduces a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism to optimize resource allocation dynamically.

Result: The proposed framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58% (MNIST), 92.13% (Fashion-MNIST), and 75.64% (CIFAR-10), outperforming existing FF-based SNN methods. It also demonstrates significant gains in memory access and computational power consumption.

Conclusion: This novel training approach effectively addresses the challenges of SNN training, providing improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and resource optimization without relying on gradient approximations.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation efforts face privacy concerns and labor-intensive processes, hindering the development and generalization of segmentation models.

Method: The framework utilizes dual-model distillation where a teacher model conditioned on mask-image pairs regularizes the student model through predicted noise alignment and adaptive lesion-background ratio regularization. During image generation, only the student model is employed to ensure privacy.

Result: The method delivers state-of-the-art results, improving segmentation metrics (mDice/mIoU) by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19 with TransUNet and by 2.6%/3.5% on Polyps with SANet.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority in medical image segmentation while ensuring privacy-preservation through its design.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

*Yang Gao,Po-Chien Luan,Kaouther Messaoud,Lan Feng,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model for human trajectory prediction that excels in zero-shot transfer across datasets with varying temporal setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of zero-shot transfer in human trajectory prediction, particularly when datasets differ in temporal dynamics like frame rates or observation horizons.

Method: Proposed a conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata and developed OmniTraj, a model pre-trained on a large-scale heterogeneous dataset.

Result: OmniTraj achieved state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction error by over 70% in zero-shot settings and excelling on multiple datasets after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal conditioning significantly enhances robustness and generalization, making OmniTraj effective in diverse scenarios with varying temporal setups.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, I2V-GS, leveraging Gaussian Splatting to synthesize driving data by transforming infrastructure views to vehicle views. It introduces adaptive techniques and a unique dataset to improve data generation for autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating high-quality driving data is expensive and inefficient when relying on vehicle-collected methods. Instead, real-world images and recent photorealistic 3D reconstruction advancements offer an alternative.

Method: The method involves adaptive depth warping for dense view generation, cascade strategies for consistent cross-view inpainting, confidence-guided optimization for diffusion reliability, and the introduction of a new dataset, RoadSight.

Result: I2V-GS improves synthesis quality in transforming infrastructure views to vehicle views, outperforming existing methods in metrics like NTA-Iou (45.7%), NTL-Iou (34.2%), and FID (14.9%).

Conclusion: I2V-GS is an innovative approach to creating autonomous driving datasets, representing a significant step forward in leveraging synthetic data for end-to-end driving systems.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image restoration tasks face challenges due to various image degradations, requiring a robust framework to handle diverse scenarios efficiently.

Method: The paper introduces latent diffusion models (LDMs) integrated with two key modules: a Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) for adaptation to degradation types and a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) for enhancing fine-detail recovery during restoration.

Result: Experimental findings across different tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in diverse degradation settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages diffusion model priors and novel design components, proving its effectiveness and applicability for all-in-one image restoration. The authors intend to share code for future use.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

*Zhenyang Li,Xiaoyang Bai,Tongchen Zhang,Pengfei Shen,Weiwei Xu,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR enhances 3D video reconstruction by addressing challenges in dynamic scenes and complex motions through a flow-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve visual quality in high-fidelity 3D video reconstructions, especially in challenging scenarios with complex motions and significant scale variations, which current methods struggle with.

Method: The authors introduce FlowGaussian-VR, which features a velocity field rendering pipeline for optical-flow-based optimization and a flow-assisted adaptive densification strategy to refine Gaussian representations in dynamic regions.

Result: The approach demonstrated over 2.5 dB improvement in PSNR, reduced blur in dynamic textures, and produced regularized Gaussian trajectories when tested on various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR provides a notable enhancement in dynamic scene reconstructions, achieving better visual results and more structured Gaussian trajectories than existing methods.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an approach to integrate risk estimation into pixel attribution (PA) methods for enhancing explainability in image classification, especially for intraoperative tissue characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making and safety in tumor resections by making machine learning image classification explainable, addressing the issue of overconfidence in deep learning models' predictions and their associated pixel attributions.

Method: The proposed approach creates a volume of PA maps through iterative application of classification models and PA methods. This volume is used to generate pixel-wise distributions of PA values, resulting in an enhanced PA map with expectation values and associated risk estimation using the coefficient of variation (CV).

Result: The method was evaluated on pCLE data and ImageNet, demonstrating improved explainability and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating risk estimation into pixel attribution methods enhances explainability and reliability for image classification, potentially benefiting intraoperative decision-making.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Angela Dai,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven approach to improve non-rigid shape correspondence using generative modeling, replacing traditional axiomatic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for non-rigid shape correspondence rely heavily on predefined axiomatic models, which restrict their accuracy and generalization to specific scenarios. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by introducing data-driven methodologies.

Method: The authors train a score-based generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain and introduce a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models to replace axiomatic regularization techniques.

Result: The learned generative model demonstrated strong performance across various shape categories and fully replaced traditional regularization methods. Experiments showed superior results in zero-shot non-rigid shape matching compared to axiomatic approaches.

Conclusion: Data-driven regularization via generative models can significantly improve the flexibility and accuracy of non-rigid shape matching tasks, showcasing potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

*Rongzhen Zhao,Yi Zhao,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Slot Attention method, DIAS, improving Object-Centric Learning by addressing slot redundancy and leveraging self-distillation for better object discovery and visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Object-Centric Learning techniques suffer from slot redundancy and solely rely on reconstruction-based supervision, leading to issues like incorrect segmentation of objects into parts.

Method: The proposed DIAS approach reduces slot redundancy by re-initializing aggregated slots and uses self-distillation to approximate less effective first-iteration attention maps to the final iteration's better ones.

Result: DIAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as object discovery, recognition, visual prediction, and reasoning.

Conclusion: Re-initialization of slots and leveraging self-distillation address key limitations of OCL, improving performance across visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study addresses the limitations of existing 3D affordance reasoning methods and introduces SeqAffordSplat and SeqSplatNet for handling sequential, multi-object interactions in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D affordance reasoning are limited to single-object, single-step interactions, which are insufficient for real-world, long-horizon tasks.

Method: The study proposes SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end model that maps instructions to sequences of 3D affordance masks using a language model, segmentation tokens, geometric reconstruction pre-training, and feature injection from 2D Vision Foundation Models.

Result: SeqSplatNet achieves state-of-the-art results on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark, handling sequential affordance tasks in complex scenes more effectively.

Conclusion: SeqAffordSplat and SeqSplatNet advance the field by facilitating long-horizon, complex affordance reasoning in 3D environments, bridging gaps in current capabilities.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to enable realistic physical interactions for 3D human models like SMPL-X using a "half-physics" approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current kinematic 3D human models lack the ability to interact physically with the environment, leading to interpenetration issues and unrealistic dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a 'half-physics' mechanism that combines kinematic control for human poses with physically plausible interactions, eliminating the need for complex reinforcement learning.

Result: Their approach is learning-free, operates in real time, generalizes to any body shape and motion, and retains both fidelity and realism in physical interactions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between kinematic modeling and physical realism, offering a practical method for enhanced 3D human-environment interactions.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phi-Ground, a model family for GUI grounding in computer use agents, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve GUI grounding performance for Computer Use Agents, critical for enabling accurate interaction and action execution in multimodal reasoning systems.

Method: An empirical study was conducted on grounding model training, examining the entire process from data collection to model training, leading to the development of the Phi-Ground model family.

Result: Phi-Ground achieved state-of-the-art performance across five grounding benchmarks, including scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision in end-to-end scenarios.

Conclusion: The detailed empirical analysis in this paper not only improves GUI grounding models but also provides insights beneficial for other perception tasks.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

*Zihan Wang,Jeff Tan,Tarasha Khurana,Neehar Peri,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes from sparse-view videos, addressing the limitations of traditional dense multi-view setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense multi-view setups are costly and impractical for capturing diverse wild scenarios; the paper aims to provide a more accessible approach to dynamic scene reconstruction using sparse views.

Method: Independent monocular reconstructions are carefully aligned to ensure temporal and view consistency for sparse-view setups.

Result: The proposed method delivers superior quality reconstructions compared to existing approaches, especially for rendering novel views.

Conclusion: Sparse-view dynamic scene reconstruction is feasible and effective, and the proposed method offers a practical solution with publicly available resources to support its adoption.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

They propose a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that employs parallel denoising processes with noise sharing to ensure the accurate generation of both the bird class and its attributes.

Result: Using the SUB benchmark, the study evaluates the performance of CBMs under controlled concept variations, highlighting their struggles with robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The SUB benchmark and TDG method contribute to identifying limitations of CBMs under distribution shifts and foster the development of more robust concept-based interpretable models. These tools can drive advancements in creating dependable AI systems for fields requiring high interpretability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

### [186] [Gaussian Variation Field Diffusion for High-fidelity Video-to-4D Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23785)
*Bowen Zhang,Sicheng Xu,Chuxin Wang,Jiaolong Yang,Feng Zhao,Dong Chen,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for turning video clips into high-quality animated 3D content, overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data with Gaussian Splats and a novel Diffusion Transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D content generation methods struggle due to the complexity of data construction and representation, necessitating a simpler and more efficient solution for creating dynamic 3D animations from video inputs.

Method: The framework employs a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE to encode Gaussian Splats and their temporal changes compactly, followed by a Diffusion Transformer to model animations conditioned on videos, leveraging synthetic datasets.

Result: Using the Objaverse dataset for training, the model achieves superior generation quality and generalizes well to wild video inputs, despite relying on synthetic data for training.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges the gap in video-to-4D content generation, providing efficient methods to create high-quality dynamic 3D animations while demonstrating impressive generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

### [187] [H2SGEMM: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs using FP16 Units with Precision Recovery and Cache-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23387)
*Weicheng Xue,Baisong Xu,Kai Yang,Yongxiang Liu,Dengdeng Fan,Pengxiang Xu,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents H2SGEMM, an algorithm to emulate FP32 matrix multiplication using only FP16 computation units on AI accelerators, achieving up to 77% theoretical peak performance while maintaining good numerical stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable full-precision FP32 computation on low-precision FP16 matrix engines, which traditionally lack support for accurate FP32 operations.

Method: FP32 operands are decomposed into FP16 values, with numerical errors compensated via tunable scaling parameters and a term-wise accumulation scheme to maximize accuracy. Memory optimization techniques are also employed.

Result: H2SGEMM achieves up to 77% of FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A and recovers FP32 accuracy, showing superior numerical stability in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: H2SGEMM effectively implements accurate FP32 matrix multiplication on FP16 hardware, offering good performance and numerical stability while overcoming hardware limitations.

Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but
lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,
a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI
accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and
compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed
analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision
loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of
mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on
accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves
numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.
Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are
introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to
achieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend
910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm
that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also
exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its
structured and error-aware computation order.

*Flora Angileri,Andrea Clementi,Emanuele Natale,Michele Salvi,Isabella Ziccardi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the RAES algorithm in a dynamic graph model with node churn, proving high expansion properties and fast rumor-spreading protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the behavior of RAES under dynamic graph models, capturing peer-to-peer network characteristics such as node churn.

Method: Utilize a streaming node-churn process (sliding window model) to generate a dynamic graph sequence and analyze the RAES algorithm's performance on these graphs.

Result: Every snapshot of the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion properties with high probability, enabling efficient PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols.

Conclusion: RAES effectively maintains expansion properties and enables logarithmic completion time for rumor spreading protocols in dynamic graphs with node churn.

Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti
et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex
expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based
procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input
graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain
unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models
is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model
induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window
model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the
oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph
$\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential
characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and
threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that
every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion
properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to
establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known
PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.

### [191] [KLLM: Fast LLM Inference with K-Means Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23035)
*Xueying Wu,Baijun Zhou,Zhihui Gao,Yuzhe Fu,Qilin Zheng,Yintao He,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework called KLLM, addressing issues in weight and activation quantization (WAQ) for efficient LLM inference, achieving significant speedups and energy efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference demands high memory and computational power, and while WAQ is promising, current methods suffer from accuracy loss at low precision and inefficiencies due to non-uniform quantization and activation outliers.

Method: The authors introduce KLLM, a co-design framework incorporating index-based computation for efficient processing of K-Means-quantized data and an outlier detection engine called Orizuru for runtime activation handling.

Result: KLLM demonstrates average speedups of 9.67x and 7.03x, as well as energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x and 150.21x compared to existing hardware like A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM successfully bridges software and hardware solutions to address WAQ challenges, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of LLM inference significantly.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

*Ridvan Yesiloglu,Wei Peng,Md Tauhidul Islam,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuroAR, a generative model based on autoregressive transformers, for simulating brain aging using MRI scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting brain aging trajectories from MRI scans is crucial but challenging due to high-dimensional data, subtle structural changes, and variability among individuals.

Method: The proposed NeuroAR model works by autoregressively estimating future discrete token maps derived from previous and future scans, incorporating age information through cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: NeuroAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including latent diffusion models and GANs, in synthesizing realistic brain images and modeling aging trajectories.

Conclusion: NeuroAR demonstrates superior performance in brain aging simulation, ensuring fidelity and consistency in subject-specific aging patterns for both adolescents and the elderly.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: Address the gap in detecting LLM-aided cheating in Korean and varying cognitive conditions.

Method: Collected keystroke data from 69 participants across writing tasks tied to Bloom's Taxonomy with feature extraction and classifier evaluations.

Result: Models detected transcribing and bona fide responses better than paraphrased ones, outperforming humans in detection.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics are effective for identifying LLM-assisted writing under different cognitive processes and strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a NaN-propagation method to detect sparsity in black-box functions, enhancing gradient-based optimization accuracy and speed by mitigating false negatives in gradient dependency detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of false negatives in sparsity detection caused by coincidental zero gradients in finite-difference methods, which can lead to inaccurate and inefficient gradient calculations.

Method: The NaN-propagation method systematically contaminates input values with NaN and observes output contamination to deduce input-output dependencies, ensuring conservative and accurate reconstruction of sparsity patterns in black-box numerical functions.

Result: Demonstrated on an aerospace wing weight model, the method achieved a 1.52x speedup and identified dozens of dependencies missed by traditional techniques, highlighting its effectiveness in improving optimization efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed NaN-propagation technique successfully improves sparsity detection without modifying existing black-box codes, is widely compatible with IEEE 754 standards, and is scalable with faster-than-linear time complexity for practical engineering applications.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a preferred alternative to Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for their superior interpretability, flexibility, and ability to model complex nonlinear dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of MLPs, such as poor interpretability and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features, for better efficiency in scientific machine learning.

Method: This review assesses recent advances in KAN-based models under three approaches: data-driven learning, physics-informed modeling, and deep operator learning. Comparative evaluations between KANs and MLPs were also conducted.

Result: KANs consistently show improved accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation compared to MLPs, making them more effective in handling complex systems and dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a critical evaluation of challenges like computational costs and hyperparameter tuning while highlighting the promising future research directions to enhance KANs' robustness and scalability.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing sequence models that work efficiently and accurately for streaming and parallel sequence processing without common bugs or complexities.

Method: A layer API with explicit state representation and step methods, ensuring identical results for both training and sampling scenarios.

Result: The API demonstrated strong correctness guarantees, enabling immediate streamable complex models.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers simplifies building production-scale sequence models while mitigating common sequence processing issues and ensuring compatibility with major deep learning libraries.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel multi-hazard early warning system for agriculture using deep learning and Explainable AI to predict and explain climatic risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency of climate extremes requires reliable systems that can capture complex interactions among climatic events for agricultural risk management.

Method: A multi-hazard forecasting framework integrating sequential deep learning models with Explainable AI techniques (e.g., TimeSHAP and attention mechanisms).

Result: The framework demonstrated high predictive accuracy, especially using BiLSTM, across four U.S. agricultural regions for various severe weather events.

Conclusion: This system advances Explainable AI in multi-hazard forecasting and offers actionable insights for climate risk management in agriculture.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: Address the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the privacy concerns in predictive healthcare systems by developing a federated learning framework capable of handling real-world constraints.

Method: The paper proposed FedCVD++, combining parametric and non-parametric models, tree-subset sampling, XGBoost-based feature extraction, and federated SMOTE synchronization to tackle FL challenges and optimize scalability and communication efficiency.

Result: FedCVD++ showed superior outcomes with federated XGBoost and Random Forest models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.81, surpassing or matching centralized versions, and reduced communication costs by 3.2X while maintaining 95% accuracy.

Conclusion: FedCVD++ offers a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning framework for healthcare predictive systems, outperforming existing methodologies and validated in multi-institutional settings.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)

strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

### [200] [Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23000)
*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model for predicting hyperlocal heat exposure metrics at high speed and accuracy, aiding urban climate adaptation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities face growing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress due to urbanization and climate change, and existing models are computationally expensive for large-scale applications.

Method: The GSM-UTCI model combines surface morphology, high-resolution land cover data, and meteorological conditions via a feature-wise linear modulation architecture. It is trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps.

Result: The model achieves an R2 of 0.9151 and a MAE of 0.41°C, completing city-wide predictions in under five minutes, and demonstrates the cooling effects of land conversions to tree canopy in simulation experiments.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI represents a scalable, precise tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling efficient evaluation of greening strategies to mitigate heat stress in cities.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

### [201] [Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23009)
*Tom Sühr,Florian E. Dorner,Olawale Salaudeen,Augustin Kelava,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models excel in human-standardized tests but misinterpreting results as human-like traits is a mistake. This paper advocates for AI-specific tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinterpretation of AI performance on human-designed tests leads to an incorrect understanding of AI's capabilities as resembling human intelligence or personality.

Method: Critically analyzes existing use of human-centric psychological and educational tests for AI and proposes constructing AI-specific evaluation frameworks.

Result: Identifies flaws in applying human tests to AI without empirical validation and emphasizes risks like cultural bias, validity issues, and data contamination.

Conclusion: Human tests are unsuitable for evaluating AI. Developing principled, AI-specific evaluation methods will better measure AI's unique traits and avoid ontological errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [202] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of multimodal latent spaces in task-specific AI models, especially their ability to perform inverse mappings effectively. Results show chaotic and incoherent outputs when attempting inverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the largely unexplored capability of multimodal latent spaces in AI models to handle inverse tasks, such as inferring input characteristics from desired outputs.

Method: The authors used an optimization-based framework and applied it bidirectionally across text-image and text-audio modalities to evaluate inverse mapping capabilities.

Result: Experimental findings show that while models can generate outputs textually aligned with targets, the perceptual quality is often chaotic, and reconstructed embeddings lack semantic coherence and interpretability.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces optimized for forward tasks do not inherently support robust and semantically meaningful inverse mappings, highlighting the need for research on invertible latent spaces.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

### [203] [Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501)
*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA), an adaptive method for combining Q-value estimates in off-policy reinforcement learning, outperforming static ensemble strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional aggregation methods in reinforcement learning ensembles rely on static rules like taking the minimum, which can lead to coarse and task-insensitive outcomes. The paper seeks to improve Q-value estimation to enhance performance.

Method: DEA employs two learnable directional parameters—one modulating conservatism and another guiding policy exploration. These parameters leverage ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors for data-driven aggregation.

Result: DEA demonstrates effectiveness in varying training regimes, surpassing static aggregation methods across continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensemble aggregation can significantly improve Q-value estimation, benefiting policy learning in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

*Aurélie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study integrates actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to uncover causal links in time series data, revealing how individual behaviors impact process outcomes like throughput time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to better understand how individual actor behavior and their interactions influence process outcomes, as traditional methods lack the capability to effectively capture temporal and causal dynamics.

Method: The paper uses real-world event logs to analyze actor interactions such as continuation, interruption, and handovers. Granger causality and Group Lasso for lag selection are employed to identify the causal links and influential lags in time series data.

Result: The analysis shows that actor behavior, including interaction patterns, directly influences process performance, particularly by affecting throughput time.

Conclusion: Actor-centric, time-series-based approaches offer deeper insights into the temporal dependencies affecting process outcomes, highlighting the measurable impact of individual behaviors on overall efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-FDR, a simulated annealing-based algorithm, performs global optimization for feature selection using the Fisher discriminant ratio. It selects compact and highly predictive feature subsets, benefiting settings where interpretability and sparsity matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create an effective feature selection algorithm suitable for high-dimensional datasets, balancing model sparsity, interpretability, and classification accuracy while overcoming limitations of greedy approaches.

Method: The paper proposes SA-FDR, which frames $\ell_0$-norm feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. It utilizes simulated annealing for global search and employs the Fisher discriminant ratio as a proxy for model quality in classification.

Result: Experiments show that SA-FDR consistently selects minimal subsets of features while achieving high predictive accuracy, outperforming greedy optimization in capturing inter-feature dependencies.

Conclusion: SA-FDR is a flexible and effective algorithm for interpretable model design in high-dimensional settings, particularly where sparsity and performance are critical.

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

*Junyi Fan,Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Yong Si,Minoo Ahmadi,Greg Placencia,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study developed a machine learning model using routine ICU data to predict vancomycin-induced kidney injury with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of early prediction of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients, which is key for timely interventions.

Method: The study used data from 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) and applied SelectKBest and Random Forest for feature selection. Six algorithms were tested using 5-fold cross-validation, and interpretability methods like SHAP and ALE were employed.

Result: The CatBoost algorithm performed best with an AUROC of 0.818 and identified key predictors like phosphate and magnesium. Bayesian analysis confirmed high-risk predictions with a credible interval for risk.

Conclusion: The developed machine learning model enables accurate early detection of kidney injury risks, offering clinicians a tool for timely intervention and improved critical care outcomes.

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

*Annalisa Barbara,Joseph Lazzaro,Ciara Pike-Burke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines the impact of local differential privacy in thresholding bandit problems, proposing mechanisms with theoretical performance bounds and optimality near lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to integrate strong privacy guarantees into bandit problems, addressing the rising need for privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks.

Method: The authors propose Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanisms to derive private responses and analyze their effectiveness via theoretical performance bounds and comparison to lower bounds.

Result: The study demonstrates tight privacy guarantees, theoretical performance bounds, and shows the algorithms match lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms into bandit problems, highlighting an optimal balance between privacy and utility.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based model for fracture prediction that generalizes across materials, simulators, and loading conditions, reducing data requirements and providing a unified approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting material failures accurately is crucial for designing safe, reliable systems, but existing methods struggle with generalization and require significant resources.

Method: The paper proposes a transformer-based architecture that accepts multimodal inputs (structured/unstructured meshes, text) to predict fracture behavior across various scenarios and materials.

Result: The model exhibited strong performance, generalizing to unseen materials with minimal data and surpassing traditional machine learning techniques in versatility and robustness.

Conclusion: A unified, scalable model architecture for fracture prediction has been demonstrated, simplifying workflows and reducing the data and computational costs associated with material failure prediction.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance and energy usage of AI models deployed on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, to guide model and device selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of studies on the performance and energy consumption of edge devices used for deploying AI applications, which are critical for informed decision-making.

Method: The paper rigorously characterizes traditional, neural networks, and large language models on edge devices, analyzing trade-offs in metrics such as F1 score, inference time, power consumption, and memory usage.

Result: The study highlights hardware and framework optimizations, as well as tuning of AI model parameters, to achieve a balance between performance and resource usage in edge deployments.

Conclusion: Insights from this research help developers and practitioners optimize edge AI deployments for practicality, by balancing efficiency and energy consumption.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

*Richard Williams,Eric Nalisnick,Andrew Holbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiGG-E, an autoregressive model for learning joint distributions over weighted graphs, improving scalability and accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of generative models for weighted graph data is motivated by their prevalence in fields like biology, chemistry, and social sciences, alongside limitations in current models handling edge weights and graph topology jointly.

Method: BiGG-E is an advanced autoregressive model built as an extension of the BiGG model. It exploits graph sparsity to efficiently learn joint distributions over weighted graphs, with computational scaling of $O((n + m)\log n)$ for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.

Result: Simulations and benchmark experiments show that BiGG-E better captures weighted graph distributions compared to existing models, while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: BiGG-E is a scalable and accurate generative model for weighted graphs that addresses nonlocal dependencies and joint modeling challenges in graph topology and edge weights.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

*Qilin Zhou,Haipeng Wang,Zhengyuan Wei,W. K. Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CostCert, a scalable and precise defense mechanism against adversarial patch attacks, achieving superior certified accuracy over existing methods like PatchGuard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing certified recovery techniques, which struggle with precision in top-k predictions due to issues like combinatorial explosion and vote inflation controlled by attackers.

Method: CostCert uses a novel approach by verifying whether the attacker’s budget is insufficient to provide additional votes required to exclude the true label from the top k predictions, without relying on pairwise comparisons or encountering combinatorial issues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CostCert significantly outperforms PatchGuard by retaining much higher certified accuracy (e.g., 57.3% at a patch size of 96, compared to PatchGuard's 0%).

Conclusion: CostCert is a robust and scalable solution for defending against adversarial patch attacks, with provable guarantees and improved performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLOSS, a system addressing missing data challenges in federated learning (caused by user opt-out and device heterogeneity) to reduce bias and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of missing data in federated learning due to user opt-out and device stragglers, which degrade model performance and introduce bias.

Method: Developed and implemented FLOSS, a system designed to mitigate missing data issues in federated learning by accommodating opt-out users and device heterogeneity.

Result: Empirical simulations demonstrate that FLOSS effectively reduces the negative impact of missing data and improves model performance.

Conclusion: FLOSS effectively handles missing data challenges in federated learning, maintaining performance despite user opt-out and device variability.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of spoken keyword classifiers under noise by analyzing the effects of training conditions and input features on their ID and OOD generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexplored relationship between ID and OOD generalization in audio-based models, specifically spoken keyword classifiers, and assess how noise impacts performance.

Method: Several neural architectures were benchmarked across multiple evaluation sets. Two metrics, Fairness (F) and Robustness (R), were used to measure accuracy gains and the convergence between ID and OOD performance.

Result: Noise-aware training was found to improve robustness in specific configurations when evaluating spoken keyword classifiers.

Conclusion: Noise-based data augmentation can enhance robustness and generalization in speech models, though its benefits are context-dependent.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

### [214] [Observational Multiplicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23136)
*Erin George,Deanna Needell,Berk Ustun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a measure called 'regret' to evaluate how arbitrary probabilistic classifications are by analyzing how predictions could shift with changes in training labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of arbitrariness in probabilistic classification tasks, specifically in cases where multiple models perform equally well but give conflicting predictions. This undermines interpretability and safety.

Method: A regret-based analysis is introduced, estimating how much predictions could vary due to differences in training labels. The authors propose a general-purpose method to quantify this regret in probabilistic classification.

Result: The proposed regret measure reveals higher levels of arbitrariness (regret) for specific groups in datasets, pointing to areas where predictions are less reliable.

Conclusion: By using regret estimation, the paper highlights potential applications such as promoting safety through abstention or improved data collection in real-world probabilistic tasks.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

### [215] [AI paradigm for solving differential equations: first-principles data generation and scale-dilation operator AI solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23141)
*Xiangshu Gong,Zhiqiang Xie,Xiaowei Jin,Chen Wang,Yanling Qu,Wangmeng Zuo,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new AI framework to solve differential equations using first-principles data generation and a Fourier-based scale-dilation operator (SDO). The methods aim to fix approximation challenges in high-frequency components and achieve superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI solvers for differential equations struggle due to data scarcity and issues in approximating high-frequency components. Solving these issues can enhance AI's usability in engineering and nature-based problems.

Method: The paper leverages a novel first-principles data generation to create vast datasets and introduces a scale-dilation operator (SDO) to smooth the loss landscape. Additionally, it uses a spatiotemporal Transformer-based AI solver to improve performance on high-frequency components.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated superior accuracy in solving various differential equations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This paradigm makes AI solvers more robust and applicable across a wide range of scientific and engineering problems, addressing critical limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FuseTen, a generative framework that creates daily, high-resolution (10m) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data by combining information from multiple satellite platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of monitoring urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, which suffers from trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolutions in satellite observations.

Method: FuseTen is a generative architecture leveraging data from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. It incorporates an averaging-based supervision strategy, attention and normalization modules, and a PatchGAN discriminator to improve data realism.

Result: FuseTen achieves a 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and a 31.42% improvement in visual fidelity compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FuseTen effectively overcomes the spatial and temporal resolution trade-offs in satellite platforms, demonstrating its potential as the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at a 10m resolution.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need to balance key design priorities such as speed, factual correctness, and reasoning ability in LLM-based services, but such balance is challenging.

Method: The authors formally prove the existence of this trade-off and propose a structured framework named the BAR Theorem for addressing these challenges.

Result: The analysis confirms that no single model can excel at all three properties simultaneously and offers a framework to navigate these compromises.

Conclusion: The BAR Theorem formalizes the inherent trade-offs in LLM service design and provides a guiding framework for making informed design decisions.

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:
inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However,
our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocsRay, a training-free multimodal document understanding system combining pseudo-Table of Contents (TOC) generation and hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in understanding multimodal documents due to structural inconsistencies and limited training data.

Method: DocsRay employs a framework combining hierarchical pseudo-TOC generation, zero-shot multimodal analysis converting document elements into text-centric representations, and a two-stage hierarchical retrieval to reduce complexity.

Result: DocsRay achieved a 45% efficiency improvement in query latency and attained 64.7% accuracy on the MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The system effectively processes and understands complex multimodal documents without the need for specialized models or additional training, demonstrating efficiency and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

*Charles O'Neill,Slava Chalnev,Chi Chi Zhao,Max Kirkby,Mudith Jayasekara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for detecting and steering AI-generated contextual hallucinations by manipulating a specific linear direction in the model's residual stream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenging issue of contextual hallucinations in AI-generated statements, which detract from their reliability and interpretability.

Method: It proposes using a generator-agnostic observer model with a linear probe to detect hallucinations in a model's residual stream and analyzes sparse activity in late-layer MLP circuits.

Result: The approach isolates a single transferable linear direction that significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting hallucinations. Manipulating this direction reduces generator hallucination rates consistently across different model sizes.

Conclusion: This study provides evidence of low-dimensional hallucination tracking in AI models and suggests novel approaches for detection and mitigation, supported by the new ContraTales benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

### [220] [Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257)
*Jiawei Liu,Chenwang Wu,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new machine unlearning algorithm, IAU, inspired by incremental learning concepts, to efficiently remove data from models without significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for maintaining data privacy has led to the need for effective machine unlearning methods to "forget" specific training data, especially as current methods like influence-based unlearning are computation-intensive and impractical for large-scale models.

Method: The paper draws inspiration from cognitive science to establish a theoretical link between incremental learning (memorizing) and machine unlearning (forgetting). Building on this link, it develops the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm to enable efficient data removal through gradient-based optimization.

Result: The proposed IAU algorithm delivers a better balance among privacy guarantees, computational efficiency, and model utility. It outperforms existing unlearning methods across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: The IAU algorithm successfully addresses the challenges of machine unlearning by introducing a novel approach inspired by incremental learning, ensuring effective, efficient, and utility-preserving data removal while advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm introduces a dynamic framework for multi-agent systems (MAS) that optimizes graph structures and adapts them to individual samples, outperforming existing baselines on reasoning, question answering, and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS frameworks rely heavily on static and manually designed graph structures, which limit adaptability and reduce overall performance.

Method: The paper proposes DynaSwarm, featuring an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism for stability and a dynamic graph selector for adapting graph structures to input samples via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on various tasks like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding show that DynaSwarm outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across different LLM backbones.

Conclusion: DynaSwarm emphasizes the importance of dynamic, sample-specific graph structures in designing adaptable and high-performing MAS frameworks.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

*Yuetian Chen,Zhiqi Wang,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how deep learning models encode membership inference risks during training, proposing a framework to analyze privacy leakage at a sample level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how deep learning models encode data vulnerabilities during training and to address privacy risks associated with training data leaks.

Method: Developed a dynamic analytical framework that tracks individual sample vulnerabilities in the FPR-TPR plane throughout model training, evaluating the influences of factors like dataset complexity and model architecture.

Result: Discover a strong correlation between a sample’s intrinsic learning difficulty and its early privacy risk emergence, showing how privacy risks form over the training period.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of privacy risk dynamics in deep learning and aims to inform strategies for privacy-aware model training.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying forgotten supermarket items and explaining recommendations in the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain, introducing interpretable algorithms that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NBP methods fail to detect unintentionally omitted items and typically rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and explanatory power, limiting their usability.

Method: The paper introduces two novel, interpretable-by-design algorithms tailored to predict forgotten items and offering human-understandable justifications for recommendations.

Result: The proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15% across various evaluation metrics when tested on a real-world retail dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces a new task (forgotten item prediction) and demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability of their proposed methods in addressing current gaps in the NBP domain.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Tao He,Rongchuan Mu,Lizi Liao,Yixin Cao,Ming Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces process reward models (PRMs) to improve reinforcement learning optimization of large reasoning models (LRMs) for solving math problems, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency compared to outcome-only reward approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize large reasoning models (LRMs) more efficiently for complex math problems by addressing limitations of sparse feedback in traditional RL approaches.

Method: The paper proposes structured thought-level process rewards and a capability-adaptive reward mechanism, integrated into the TP-GRPO algorithm, to improve credit assignment and balance exploration-exploitation during RL training.

Result: Experimental results on 1.5B and 7B parameter LRMs show enhanced problem-solving accuracy and faster training with fewer samples compared to baseline methods using outcome-only rewards.

Conclusion: Process rewards are more effective than outcome-only rewards for LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in training efficiency and problem-solving accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

*Tung M. Luu,Donghoon Lee,Younghwan Lee,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLARE leverages vision-language models to replace costly reward function design in offline RL, achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of reward function design in offline reinforcement learning, which is costly and domain-dependent, especially in safety-critical robotic applications.

Method: Uses vision-language models to provide preference labels based on visual trajectory segments, training the policy using supervised contrastive preference learning.

Result: PLARE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods in robotic manipulation tasks, both simulated and real-world.

Conclusion: The approach offers a cost-effective, practical alternative for reward signal generation, enhancing offline RL's adaptability and performance in robotics.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a differentiable agent-based simulation to optimize dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, solving inventory imbalance issues while accommodating probabilistic user choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatiotemporal imbalances in bicycle station inventory caused by differing user demands and reduce associated relocation costs.

Method: Developed a differentiable agent-based simulation to design dynamic pricing policies that account for probabilistic user decisions and spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips.

Result: Achieved 73-78% reduction in loss and over a 100x increase in convergence speed compared to conventional methods, validated on both small-scale (25 stations, 100 parameters) and large-scale (289 stations, 1156 parameters) scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic pricing policies generated by this approach effectively balance bike inventory without manual intervention while minimizing discount costs through appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of changes on systems and addressing concept drift in machine learning to avoid failures and errors.

Method: Development of a framework for causal explanations of concept drift, isolating relevant features for targeted intervention.

Result: Demonstrated the practical utility of the framework across multiple use cases.

Conclusion: The framework enhances actionability by identifying causal features impacted by drift, aiding systematic intervention.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Result: The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy for detecting honey adulteration at 98.37%.

Conclusion: Mineral element profiles provide robust information for honey adulteration detection, and the random forest classifier is the most effective model on the tested dataset.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting

classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Result: ST-SSM outperformed other schemes like zigzag scanning and independent processing on multiple PDE benchmarks, with fewer parameters and competitive results. It also showed benefits under partial observability.

Conclusion: Dimensionally factorized operator learning is an effective and theoretically solid method for modeling PDEs efficiently and flexibly.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

*Yinhui Ma,Tomomasa Yamasaki,Zhehui Wang,Tao Luo,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coflex, an HW-NAS framework that combines Sparse Gaussian Process and Bayesian optimization to effectively balance performance and efficiency in neural network search and hardware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome the challenges of large search space and high computational costs in Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) for deep neural network accelerators.

Method: Coflex incorporates Sparse Gaussian Process with multi-objective Bayesian optimization, reducing kernel complexity to near-linear while preserving performance.

Result: Coflex demonstrates superior network accuracy, Energy-Delay-Product (EDP), and a computational speed-up of 1.9x to 9.5x over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Coflex enhances HW-NAS by achieving scalable optimization, reducing computation cost, and improving predictive accuracy, making it highly beneficial for edge-based DNN accelerator design.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

*Shervin Rahimzadeh Arashloo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of the large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD to include manifold regularization and signature kernel representation for improved time series anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance anomaly detection in time series data by integrating the geometric structure of the data and addressing label smoothness on its underlying manifold.

Method: The authors extend $\ell_p$-SVDD with manifold regularization and employ a signature kernel to better represent time series complexities. They leverage a Representer theorem for optimization and analyze generalization using Rademacher complexities.

Result: The proposed method is shown to improve anomaly detection performance across various datasets when compared to alternative approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating manifold information and signature kernel representation significantly enhances time series anomaly detection accuracy and performance.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper aims to predict all-cause mortality in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients using machine learning, achieving strong predictive performance and clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2DM is a widespread chronic disease that reduces life expectancy, necessitating accurate mortality risk prediction to enable personalized treatment strategies.

Method: A cohort of 554 T2DM patients was analyzed over a 16.8-year follow-up. Various ML models, including an Extra Survival Trees (EST) model, were trained, validated, and explained using SHAP for interpretability.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

### [234] [Incorporating structural uncertainty in causal decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23495)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses when Bayesian model averaging should be used to handle structural uncertainty in causal inference, focusing on bivariate relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often overlook structural uncertainty when making decisions based on causal effects, despite its potential influence on inference outcomes.

Method: The authors analyze bivariate causal structures $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \leftarrow Y$, derive conditions under which Bayesian model averaging is useful, prove optimality results for their approach, and validate these insights using simulations with modern causal discovery methods.

Result: They identify specific scenarios where accounting for structural uncertainty significantly improves decision-making and quantify conditions for the effectiveness of their approach.

Conclusion: The framework complements existing methods by addressing structural uncertainty in causal inference, a factor often ignored in practice.

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the balance between certificate length and verifier runtime, proposing a Verifier Trade-off Theorem and applying it to complexity class separations and natural problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how computational verification efficiency and certificate size are interrelated, motivated by fundamental problems in computational complexity.

Method: The authors prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem and analyze its implications for complexity class separations and specific computational problems.

Result: The theorem establishes a minimum certificate size, ties it to verification speed reductions, and applies it to separations among complexity classes and specific problems.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights into the relationship between certificate complexity and verifier runtime, offering perspectives on major complexity topics like \\(\p\\) vs. \\(\np\\).

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

*Saleh Vatan Khah,Savelii Chezhegov,Shahrokh Farahmand,Samuel Horváth,Eduard Gorbunov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence analyses for gradient clipping require the clipping threshold to increase with iterations, making them incompatible with Differential Privacy mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism.

Method: The authors present a high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level under heavy-tailed noise, relying on bounded central α-th moment assumptions for α ∈ (1,2].

Result: The method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution faster than existing ones and offers a balance between noise from DP and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The research bridges the gap between standard gradient clipping practices and Differential Privacy requirements by enabling efficient optimization with fixed clipping thresholds while maintaining privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

### [237] [Continual Learning with Synthetic Boundary Experience Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23534)
*Chih-Fan Hsu,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces Synthetic Boundary Data (SBD) through a novel Experience Blending framework to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. It achieves notable improvements in performance over nine baselines on benchmarks like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by finding ways to enhance the stability of decision boundaries, especially when using experience replay methods.

Method: The method involves Experience Blending, which combines stored key samples with synthetically generated data (SBD) using multivariate DP noise to represent boundary-adjacent input features, and an end-to-end training strategy leveraging both forms of data.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements, outperforming nine baselines by 10% on CIFAR-10, 6% on CIFAR-100, and 13% on Tiny ImageNet.

Conclusion: Introducing synthetically generated data near decision boundaries serves as an implicit regularizer that enhances model performance and mitigates forgetting in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

*Georg Slamanig,Francesco Corti,Olga Saukh*

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore applied to convolutional architectures on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PEFT methods are extensively studied in large language models, their application to convolutional neural networks, especially on resource-constrained edge devices, remains unexplored.

Method: The paper benchmarks popular PEFT methods using convolutional architectures, evaluates distribution shifts and unseen class handling, and compares computational costs using PyTorch profilers.

Result: PEFT methods showed reduced computational costs (FLOPs) by up to 95% on edge-constrained architectures but were less memory-efficient with depthwise-separable architectures.

Conclusion: PEFT methods provide valuable trade-offs in memory efficiency and computational costs for edge deployment, aiding model selection based on specific application needs and hardware constraints.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

*Piotr Indyk,Michael Kapralov,Kshiteej Sheth,Tal Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a subquadratic-time algorithm for computing matrix-vector products in Gaussian kernel matrices, validated with an assumption that matrix sum growth scales linearly in n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to address the challenge of efficiently processing attention matrices, which arises in contexts such as large language models.

Method: The authors design a subquadratic-time algorithm relying on a modelling assumption that the sum of the Gaussian kernel matrix entries grows linearly with the number of data points.

Result: The result is a subquadratic-time computational algorithm for matrix-vector products, experimentally validated for Gaussian kernel matrices in various applications like fast attention computation.

Conclusion: The algorithm significantly improves computational efficiency, providing a feasible and scalable approach under the stated modeling assumptions.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive framework enhancing reasoning skills of LLMs through a new reinforcement learning approach and hybrid retrieval strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG techniques struggle with complex multi-hop reasoning due to reliance on rigid heuristics and underutilization of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: GraphRAG-R1 employs a modified Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with novel reward functions—Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) and Cost-Aware F1 (CAF)—and utilizes a phase-dependent training approach and hybrid graph-textual retrieval.

Result: Experiments confirm that GraphRAG-R1 significantly outperforms existing GraphRAG models on various datasets, enhancing reasoning ability and allowing flexible integration with retrieval methods.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 is a robust innovation that optimizes the reasoning performance of LLMs and can work seamlessly with existing retrieval systems for solving complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

### [242] [EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600)
*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EB-gMCR, an energy-based deep learning framework for multivariate curve resolution (MCR), overcoming scalability and reliability issues in signal unmixing by automatically selecting the minimal set of latent components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCR methods face challenges in scalability and require user-specified component counts, which are often unknown in real datasets.

Method: The authors propose a generative formulation of MCR (gMCR) and introduce EB-gMCR, which uses a differentiable gating network for component selection, starting with a large candidate pool.

Result: EB-gMCR achieves exceptional performance on synthetic datasets, maintaining high R^2 (>=0.98 to 0.99), accurately estimating component counts within 5% or closer to the ground truth, even in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR unites generative modeling with component selection to advance large-scale signal unmixing, with adaptability across domains and instruments through simple plug-in priors.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method combining hierarchical reinforcement learning and message-passing to improve multi-agent coordination and decision-making under challenges like non-stationarity and partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of partial observability and non-stationarity in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning and to explore the under-utilized combination of hierarchical RL and message-passing for improved scalability and coordination.

Method: A methodology adopting the feudal hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with hierarchical graph structures where agents communicate with neighbors and receive hierarchical goals. A novel reward assignment approach is utilized to train lower-level policies based on the advantage function of upper levels.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on related benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The combination of hierarchical reinforcement learning with message-passing offers a scalable and efficient solution for multi-agent coordination, overcoming optimization challenges, and advancing the field of decentralized MARL.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model for better predicting patient enrollment in clinical trials, using PLMs, tabular data, and probabilistic methods to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate patient enrollment prediction is a critical challenge in clinical trials, demanding solutions for effective planning and financial optimization.

Method: The method combines PLMs for processing clinical documents, an attention mechanism for tabular data, and a probabilistic Gamma-based layer to predict patient enrollment with uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate superior performance of this model in estimating enrolled patients across different trial sites compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the accuracy and reliability of patient enrollment predictions in clinical trials, which is key for optimizing trial planning and success.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

### [246] [On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632)
*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores why softmax attention is more expressive than linear attention methods by deriving and analyzing its recurrent form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of softmax attention, which has a quadratic memory and computational cost, while also exploring why linear attention methods, despite being more efficient, fall short in accuracy.

Method: The authors derive a recurrent form of softmax attention, effectively modeling it as a recurrent neural network (RNN), and perform component ablations to analyze its expressiveness.

Result: The study reveals that the structure of softmax attention, when reinterpreted as an RNN, highlights its superior expressiveness compared to linear attention methods.

Conclusion: This work explains the expressiveness gap between softmax and linear attention and provides insights into the essential components that make softmax attention effective.

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust offers a promising solution for secure and robust FL by combining advanced gradient evaluation and adaptive learning with enhanced convergence methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains

OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data

Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage
points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust
performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods like SHAP are widely used for model understanding, but their potential for guiding model optimization is not well explored.

Method: The framework incorporates entropy-based penalties into model training to enhance sparse, stable, and interpretable feature attributions for both regression and classification tasks.

Result: Experiments using TreeSHAP on benchmark datasets show improved generalization performance and robust feature attributions.

Conclusion: The proposed SHAP-guided regularization makes machine learning models more accurate, interpretable, and reliable.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of LLMs by reducing query response costs and latency while still ensuring personalization and relevance in chatbot interactions, despite challenges with semantic similarity search.

Method: The authors propose TweakLLM, which uses a lightweight LLM to dynamically adjust cached responses to better match incoming user prompts, with evaluations such as user studies and multi-agent debates.

Result: TweakLLM achieves response quality comparable to advanced LLM models and significantly enhances caching effectiveness across real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TweakLLM offers a scalable and resource-efficient caching architecture for large-scale LLM deployments, maintaining user satisfaction and response quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

### [250] [One-Step Flow Policy Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23675)
*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), a reinforcement learning algorithm that improves the efficiency of diffusion policies by enabling fast 1-step policy sampling without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies are effective in online reinforcement learning due to their high expressiveness but are hindered by slow inference caused by iterative sampling.

Method: The proposed FPMD algorithm leverages the connection between distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in flow matching models. It avoids extra distillation or consistency training and introduces two variants—flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations.

Result: FPMD achieves comparable performance to diffusion policy baselines on MuJoCo benchmarks while reducing function evaluations during inference by several hundred times.

Conclusion: FPMD emerges as an efficient and practical reinforcement learning approach, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational requirements for policy inference.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

### [251] [DepMicroDiff: Diffusion-Based Dependency-Aware Multimodal Imputation for Microbiome Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23676)
*Rabeya Tus Sadia,Qiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DepMicroDiff, a novel model for microbiome data imputation, which improves on accuracy by leveraging diffusion-based modeling and contextual metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microbiome data is sparse and noisy, hampering accurate imputation and subsequent applications like biomarker discovery. Existing methods fail to capture complex microbial dependencies and overlook metadata.

Method: The proposed DepMicroDiff integrates diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) for pairwise and autoregressive data dependency modeling. The framework also uses VAE-based pretraining on diverse datasets and incorporates contextual metadata via a large language model (LLM).

Result: DepMicroDiff outperformed state-of-the-art methods on TCGA microbiome datasets, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE/MAE for various cancer types.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrated robustness and superior generalizability, showcasing its efficacy in addressing microbiome data challenges and improving imputation accuracy.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

### [252] [Anomalous Samples for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23712)
*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates incorporating anomalous samples in few-shot anomaly classification and proposes a new multi-score detection methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous data is often assumed to be less available compared to normal data in anomaly detection approaches, but this assumption may not hold true in few-shot settings where even minimal anomalous data can significantly aid performance.

Method: The authors propose a multi-score anomaly detection methodology that uses anomalous samples along with techniques like Zero-Shot and memory-based approaches. They also introduce an augmentation-based validation technique for optimizing anomaly score aggregation.

Result: The proposed methodology demonstrates effectiveness on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: Utilizing anomalous samples with a multi-score approach can improve anomaly classification in few-shot settings, challenging traditional assumptions in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

### [253] [Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756)
*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy to reduce annotation errors in Active Learning by considering annotators' mood and fatigue levels using a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and annotation errors in Active Learning systems by factoring in internal cognitive conditions like mood and fatigue of annotators.

Method: A Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS) is introduced to rank annotators for labeling tasks, based on their past accuracy, mood, and fatigue levels, along with instance-specific information.

Result: The proposed approach reduces annotation errors and model uncertainty during training, and achieves higher Accuracy and F1-score compared to methods that ignore internal cognitive factors.

Conclusion: Integrating cognitive factors such as mood and fatigue in annotator selection can enhance the effectiveness of Active Learning systems, pointing to a broader potential in addressing human cognitive variables in machine learning.

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

*Justin Kay,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Daniel Sheldon,Sara Beery*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents CODA, a method for efficiently selecting the best machine learning model by actively using consensus and disagreement-driven annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model selection is critical but expensive due to traditional reliance on annotated validation datasets.

Method: CODA uses Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling to guide the annotation process based on model consensus and disagreement.

Result: CODA outperforms existing methods in reducing annotation effort by over 70% in model selection tasks.

Conclusion: CODA significantly streamlines active model selection, making it cost-effective and efficient in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

*Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuron model with dual behaviors: signal propagation and signal generation, alongside analysis and simulation of its dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dive deeper into the dynamics and functional diversity of a previously proposed neuron model for enhancing neuromorphic system design.

Method: The research uses systematic parameter exploration, mathematical analysis, and simulations, introducing a novel intermediate metric called 'on-road energy.'

Result: The model displays functional duality (stable propagation and sustained oscillations), with controllable transitions between states via parameter adjustments or external signals.

Conclusion: The findings highlight parallels to biological neurons' dual roles, offering a theoretical framework for applying the model in neuromorphic engineering.

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

*Bingjia Xiao,Tao Chen,Wenbin Zhang,Xin Qian,Puqing Jiang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Optimizing thermal property extraction from FDTR measurements, the study finds HPSO as the most efficient AI-driven hybrid algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of extracting multiple parameters from FDTR measurements, a nonlinear inverse problem due to high dimensionality and non-convex solution space.

Method: The study evaluates four global optimization algorithms and proposes AI-driven hybrid variants combining these algorithms with Quasi-Newton refinement.

Result: HPSO outperformed other methods in convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness, achieving target fitness values more reliably and faster than alternatives.

Conclusion: HPSO is identified as a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and model-fitting techniques.

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of traditional EMG-based finger force estimation methods which require large datasets and high computational power, restricting real-time applications in embedded systems.

Method: The method involves decoding motor neuron spike trains extracted from high-density EMG signals, using a spiking neural network deployed on a neuromorphic processor for real-time finger force regression.

Result: The study demonstrates accurate finger force predictions with minimal energy use, showcasing real-time, low-power inference capabilities.

Conclusion: This work marks the first successful application of motor neuron-based continuous regression on neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for efficient embedded systems in prosthetics and wearable neurotechnology.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

TL;DR: This paper introduces new theoretical tools and methods for abstract interpretation and program analysis using constraint-based abstract domains and functional abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in inferring closed-form bounds on recursively defined functions used in program analysis and hybrid systems.

Method: The method involves developing constraint-based abstract domains, particularly B-bound domains, as well as domain abstraction to extend Galois connections and simplify transfer functions.

Result: The results include the ability to infer highly non-linear numerical invariants, automated transfer function design using convexity properties, and dimensionality reduction through domain abstraction.

Conclusion: The techniques proposed provide practical advancements in abstract interpretation and expand its application to complex numerical and symbolic function domains.

Abstract: We present theoretical and practical results on the order theory of lattices
of functions, focusing on Galois connections that abstract (sets of) functions
- a topic known as higher-order abstract interpretation.
  We are motivated by the challenge of inferring closed-form bounds on
functions which are defined recursively, i.e. as the fixed point of an operator
or, equivalently, as the solution to a functional equation. This has multiple
applications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,
declarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential
equations.
  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains
for abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function
f by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They
allow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical
numerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in
the constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,
transfer function design.
  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings
in value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports
abstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and
enables dimensionality reduction of equations.
  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator
language, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,
including multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains.

Motivation: Existing FFIs struggle with manual configuration, boilerplate, and lack features like recursive calls and OOP support in dynamic workflows within environments like Jupyter.

Method: Kernel-FFI uses source-level transformation to rewrite cross-language calls automatically, supports OOP via foreign object referencing, and introduces a side-channel communication mechanism for asynchronous and recursive calls.

Result: Kernel-FFI simplifies cross-language function calls and object manipulation, removes the need for manual bindings, and enhances support for crucial programming constructs.

Conclusion: Kernel-FFI enhances productivity in notebook environments by providing a robust, automated, and language-agnostic solution for multi-language programming workflows.

Abstract: Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) are essential for enabling
interoperability between programming languages, yet existing FFI solutions are
ill-suited for the dynamic, interactive workflows prevalent in modern notebook
environments such as Jupyter. Current approaches require extensive manual
configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for
recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features
critical for productive, multi-language development.
  We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that
enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within

automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for
manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by
enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across
language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the labor-intensive process of dormant tree pruning in fruit orchards by automating with robotic pruning systems.

Method: The method involves a visuomotor controller trained in a simulated orchard environment, leveraging optical flow images from a wrist-mounted camera instead of traditional 3D reconstructions.

Result: The controller shows a 30% success rate in performing pruning tasks, which is roughly half the efficiency of an ideal oracle planner.

Conclusion: The proposed robotic pruning system demonstrates potential in both simulation and real-world applications, though its efficiency needs further improvement to match optimal planning systems.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust, scalable, and practical algorithm for multi-sensor calibration, making it highly relevant for robotics and other fields requiring accurate sensor alignment.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

TL;DR: The study presents a framework for quadruped robots that generates diverse locomotion styles using CVAE for motion synthesis and imitation learning for control, deployed successfully in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of limited reference motion data diversity for quadruped robots, enabling versatile locomotion styles.

Method: The paper employs CVAE for generating multi-style locomotion sequences and adversarial motion priors for enhanced imitation learning.

Result: The framework improves velocity tracking and stability, effectively validating its deployment on real-world quadruped robots performing complex motions like gallop and pacing.

Conclusion: This approach provides a unified solution for generating diverse motion profiles and achieves improved robot locomotion control and execution in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Perception Agent,' a technology utilizing integration between speech, large language models (LLMs), and foundation models for an intuitive surgical assistance system, improving human-machine interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for better natural human-machine interfaces in dynamic surgical environments, as contemporary AI solutions often lack flexibility and depend on rigid manual prompting.

Method: A novel Perception Agent is presented, incorporating speech-friendly LLMs, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), tracking foundation models, memory mechanisms, and tools for segmenting seen and unseen elements.

Result: The agent demonstrates performance comparable to manual-prompting approaches and effectively segments novel surgical elements using a custom-curated dataset.

Conclusion: The Perception Agent advances human-machine symbiosis in surgery by providing natural interaction, flexibility, and adaptability, contributing to AI-driven real-time assistance in surgical contexts.

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTBench, a benchmark for multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), using GPU-accelerated simulation to evaluate MTRL algorithms across multiple robotic tasks. This allows for faster and diverse data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing MTRL research, which is constrained to off-policy methods and low parallelization, and to leverage the advantages of on-policy algorithms with massive parallelization.

Method: Introduces MTBench, which utilizes the GPU-accelerated IsaacGym simulator to evaluate MTRL algorithms across 70 robotics tasks. It provides a unified framework with 50 manipulation tasks, 20 locomotion tasks, and includes several base RL and state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms.

Result: MTBench offers notably faster evaluation for MTRL approaches and reveals unique challenges posed by combining massive parallelism with MTRL techniques.

Conclusion: MTBench represents a significant step forward for advancing MTRL research by providing an open-source benchmark, accelerating data collection, and enabling performance evaluation for various MTRL algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using thruster-assisted walking to enhance stability and locomotion in a legged-aerial robot named Husky Beta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve stability and locomotion adaptability in legged robots, especially under challenging conditions such as narrow paths.

Method: Simulations of a quadruped robot equipped with thrusters on sagittal knee joints to aid stability, with a controller using a centroidal dynamics model and a QP solver under a model predictive control framework.

Result: The robot was able to stably walk on narrow paths and recover from lateral disturbances in simulation by utilizing thrusters.

Conclusion: Thruster-assisted walking aids stability and expands motion capabilities, particularly in challenging scenarios like narrow-path navigation and push recovery.

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

*Loris Schneider,Marc Ungen,Elias Huber,Jan-Felix Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simulation-based method to optimize motion sequences for reconfigurable multi-robot cells, focusing on minimizing assembly duration through decomposition-based motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in optimizing motion sequences for reconfigurable multi-robot cells to adapt to fluctuating assembly demands, particularly in minimizing assembly durations.

Method: The authors separate assembly steps into core and traverse operations, formulating scheduling as an optimization problem. They utilize various solution techniques, such as sampling heuristics, tree-based search, and gradient-free optimization, coupled with a decomposition-based motion planning strategy.

Result: The proposed method generates efficient, collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures, outperforming decentralized, robot-individual planning methods.

Conclusion: Simulation experiments verify that the approach significantly improves multi-robot motion coordination and assembly efficiency, suggesting practical applications in optimizing tasks in reconfigurable multi-robot cells.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

TL;DR: GSFusion integrates LiDAR, visual, and inertial data for photorealistic map-building, overcoming conventional 3D mapping limitations like poor illumination and sparse data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing drawbacks in traditional 3D mapping methods using camera-based systems, including poor performance in challenging environments and computational inefficiency, and improving sparse-data processing with LiDAR integration.

Method: The paper presents GSFusion, an online mapping system utilizing LiDAR data with a surfel-to-surfel constraint for global pose-graph optimization, pixel-aware Gaussian initialization, and a bounded sigmoid constraint.

Result: GSFusion delivers superior rendering quality and map-building efficiency compared to existing 3DGS SLAM systems, as validated through experiments on public datasets and proprietary data.

Conclusion: GSFusion effectively leverages LiDAR alongside inertial and visual data to address challenges in photorealistic mapping, outperforming standard approaches.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

*Yixuan Dang,Qinyang Xu,Yu Zhang,Xiangtong Yao,Liding Zhang,Zhenshan Bing,Florian Roehrbein,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a whisker-inspired tactile sensing system that incorporates active control for accurate object contour reconstruction, validated through simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisker-inspired tactile perception lacks active control, leading to challenges in maintaining proper contact poses and accurately reconstructing object contours.

Method: The paper introduces a magnetic whisker sensor with a robust suspension system, uses gradient descent for tip contact localization, Bayesian filtering for stability, and a B-Spline curve for predicting surface curvature and maintaining optimal sensor orientation.

Result: The system achieves sub-millimeter accuracy in contour reconstruction and tracks objects effectively in simulations and real-world scenarios using three different objects.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable precise tactile sensing and contour tracking, demonstrating practical value in robotic applications.

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

*Lucas Elbert Suryana,Saeed Rahmani,Simeon Craig Calvert,Arkady Zgonnikov,Bart van Arem*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions in ethically challenging everyday scenarios by modeling human considerations like legality and comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure AVs make decisions aligning with human expectations while navigating ethically complex everyday situations, beyond high-stakes dilemmas like trolley problems.

Method: A reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework assigns weights to agent priorities, models human reasons, and uses a balance function to evaluate AV decision-making.

Result: The framework revealed tensions, such as trade-offs between legal compliance, efficiency, and comfort, in scenarios like overtaking.

Conclusion: The framework provides a modular, interpretable tool for incorporating Meaningful Human Control in AV systems, bridging the gap between ethical considerations and practical decision-making.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve drifting control for safety in emergency scenarios, overcoming challenges posed by the simulation-to-reality gap in reinforcement learning applications.

Method: The authors propose using GPU-accelerated parallel simulation combined with systematic domain randomization to develop reinforcement learning policies transferable to physical systems. They validate the method on a 1/10 scale RC car with individual wheel drive control.

Result: Experiments on various drifting scenarios demonstrated precise trajectory tracking and controlled sideslip angles in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between simulation and real-world performance, offering a viable solution for safe and precise vehicle drifting.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

Motivation: Address the need for autonomous robots capable of efficiently navigating unstructured agricultural environments while minimizing soil damage and protecting vegetation.

Method: Develop an integrated navigation framework combining the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) for global minimum-length path planning and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for local trajectory optimization and control.

Result: The approach yielded smoother and shorter paths, reducing total travel distance by approximately 16% compared to other methods, while effectively steering robots to targets through simulations on real-world agricultural datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances autonomous navigation in agricultural settings, showcasing its potential for precise and efficient operations in challenging terrains.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

*Yuta Kawachi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to close the sim-to-real gap in robot control by introducing gain regularization and plant parameter conditioning, improving performance over standard domain randomization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the accuracy of robot control methods when transitioning from simulated environments to real-world scenarios, especially for hardware with challenging dynamics.

Method: The paper reinterprets PID gains as proxies for unmodeled dynamics, introduces a physics-guided gain regularization scheme, and conditions neural controllers on current plant parameters during training.

Result: Applying the approach to a two-wheeled balancing robot demonstrated improved angular settling time in hardware that aligns well with simulation, outperforming standard domain-randomized policies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, offering a reproducible and lightweight solution for achieving high-fidelity control on affordable robotic hardware.

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data hampers the progress of imitation learning in robotic manipulation.

Method: This paper introduces a two-stage approach: (1) pre-training on egocentric human manipulation videos with 3D hand pose annotations, and (2) fine-tuning on robot-specific data using modular action encoders and decoders. The architecture is based on a diffusion transformer model with 2 billion parameters.

Result: H-RDT outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in simulations and real-world experiments, respectively. It shows robust performance in multitask and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Egocentric human manipulation data provides valuable behavioral priors that enhance robotic learning, establishing H-RDT as a superior approach for bimanual robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Result: Testing in urban intersection scenarios showed improved trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning with the PLA framework.

Conclusion: Language-augmented cognitive frameworks like PLA show promise for safer, more interpretable, and scalable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified

(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous

Motivation: The increased demand for social robots calls for them to adapt to users' states, necessitating accurate and holistic UX assessments, which existing methods fail to provide.

Method: The authors developed a Transformer-based model utilizing facial expressions and voice signals in a multi-instance learning framework to capture both short- and long-term interaction patterns.

Result: The experimental results indicate that the proposed Transformer-based model outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of leveraging multimodal social signals and temporal dynamics for enhanced UX estimation in HRI, moving towards more adaptable social robots.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

Motivation: Interest in using Large Language Models for robotic task planning due to their generative capabilities.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art language models using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files, compared to traditional planners across benchmarks.

Result: Models perform well on simpler tasks but struggle with complex scenarios needing precise resource management, state tracking, and adhering to constraints.

Conclusion: While effective for basic tasks, these models face limitations for intricate planning; integrating them with classical planners is recommended to improve reliability and scalability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

### [277] [Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23592)
*Haiyun Zhang,Stefano Dalla Gasperina,Saad N. Yousaf,Toshimitsu Tsuboi,Tetsuya Narita,Ashish D. Deshpande*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a subject-specific calibration framework for hand exoskeletons to improve hand tracking accuracy and adaptability to diverse anatomic variabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand exoskeletons struggle to achieve precise hand tracking due to differences in users' anatomy and inconsistencies during wearing. These issues hinder their use in detailed precision tasks.

Method: The framework utilizes redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to calibrate virtual link parameters. A data-driven approach is used to adjust cost function weights using motion capture ground truth.

Result: Testing on seven subjects showed significant reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors compared to baseline models, improving both quantitative performance and motion fidelity in a virtual hand setup.

Conclusion: The framework can generalize across various closed-loop kinematic exoskeleton designs with minimal sensing requirements, supporting advanced teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater SLAM for robot teams by overcoming limitations of conventional sonar map representations and time inefficiencies in detecting inter-robot loop closures.

Method: Introduced object graphs for representing sonar maps and developed Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization (GCM) to handle underwater-specific scan matching challenges.

Result: Validated the approach on simulated and real-world datasets, showing improved performance in underwater loop closure detection and scan matching.

Conclusion: DRACo-SLAM2 leverages object graph techniques and tailored scan matching methods to address underwater SLAM challenges effectively.

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby
inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed
approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and
real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents DuLoc, a localization method combining LiDAR-inertial odometry and offline maps for enhanced robustness and accuracy in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR localization struggles with reliability and adaptability in long-term dynamic scenarios, leading to drift and performance degradation.

Method: DuLoc integrates LiDAR-inertial odometry, offline maps, and a motion model to merge global and real-time local maps for robust localization.

Result: Extensive real-world tests with 2,856 hours of data across 32 IGVs show DuLoc outperforms state-of-the-art localization systems in challenging environments.

Conclusion: DuLoc effectively improves localization accuracy and robustness in dynamic and unbounded environments, addressing long-term challenges in LiDAR-based systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

TL;DR: BGS-SLAM introduces the first binocular 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system optimized for outdoor use, relying solely on RGB stereo pairs instead of active sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor-focused 3DGS-SLAM systems inadequately address outdoor scenarios and often depend on active depth sensors, which limits versatility.

Method: The system utilizes depth estimates from deep stereo networks and employs a multi-loss strategy to optimize 3D Gaussian representation for improved geometry and visual quality.

Result: BGS-SLAM outperforms existing 3DGS-based SLAM solutions in tracking accuracy and mapping in outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates BGS-SLAM as a pioneering SLAM framework for outdoor applications, offering high performance without LiDAR or active sensors.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian
optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency
and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other
3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.

Motivation: Address limitations in current Visual-Language-Action models for robot manipulation, particularly in latent action integration and generalization.

Method: Develop the villa-X framework by refining latent action learning and its integration in the pre-training process of VLA models.

Result: villa-X demonstrates improved execution across simulated environments like SIMPLER and LIBERO, along with real-world robot setups involving grippers and dexterous hand manipulation.

Conclusion: The ViLLA paradigm offers promising advancements in robot manipulation with villa-X serving as a foundational model for future work in this domain.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

TL;DR: This paper explores reinforcement learning (RL) methods to improve visuomotor agents in Minecraft, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen environments using automated task synthesis and large-scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome RL models' tendency to overfit specific tasks or environments, which limits their ability to generalize visuomotor behaviors across diverse settings.

Method: The paper establishes cross-view goal specification as a unified multi-task goal space and proposes automated task synthesis within Minecraft for scalable RL training, supported by a distributed RL framework.

Result: Experiments show RL boosts interaction success rates by 4x and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning capabilities in diverse 3D environments, including real-world settings.

Conclusion: RL training in customizable 3D simulated environments like Minecraft demonstrates significant potential for improving visuomotor agents' generalization and spatial reasoning abilities across diverse tasks.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CITRAS, a bioinspired tactile antenna sensor for insect-scale robots, enabling effective tactile sensing with a small, lightweight, and low-power design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate robust tactile sensing and navigation capabilities of natural systems, such as the American cockroach, in insect-scale robots while overcoming constraints like size, weight, and power.

Method: CITRAS, a bioinspired multi-segmented laminate sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors, was designed to achieve compliant bending and accurate hinge angle measurements, enabling multifunctional tactile perception.

Result: CITRAS demonstrated low angular measurement errors (0.79° for quasistatic and 3.58° for dynamic bending), and exhibited capabilities like predicting tip distances with 7.75% error, estimating gap widths with 6.73% error, and distinguishing textures.

Conclusion: CITRAS offers promising tactile sensing solutions for insect-scale robots, addressing key limitations, and enhancing capabilities for autonomous exploration and environmental interaction in complex environments.

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

### [285] [On LLM-Assisted Generation of Smart Contracts from Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23087)
*Fabian Stiehle,Hans Weytjens,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can generate smart contract code from business process descriptions and introduces an automated evaluation framework to assess generated code, revealing that LLMs are still unreliable for critical tasks like smart contract development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in traditional rule-based code generation and existing LLM-based evaluations, such as small sample sizes and inadequate focus on code correctness beyond compilation.

Method: The authors conducted an exploratory study using an automated evaluation framework to test LLMs of various types and sizes on large datasets, assessing their ability to achieve critical process execution properties.

Result: Results indicate that LLMs fail to meet the high reliability required for smart contract development, especially regarding process flow enforcement, resource allocation, and data condition compliance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not yet reliable enough for smart contract code generation, and the paper recommends exploring responsible integrations with tools to improve reliability. The benchmarking framework can aid in future development and evaluation efforts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowETL, an autonomous example-based ETL pipeline that automates dataset transformations using a target dataset as a reference, addressing the human-intensive nature of current ETL processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the extensive human involvement in designing and implementing non-generalisable transformations in ETL workflows, which limits efficiency and scalability.

Method: FlowETL consists of components like a Planning Engine that uses paired input-output dataset examples to design transformation plans, and an ETL worker to apply these plans. It includes monitoring and logging for observability.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated strong generalization across 14 datasets with varying domains, file sizes, and structures.

Conclusion: FlowETL advances ETL automation by enabling autonomous transformation design and application, reducing the need for manual intervention and showcasing its potential across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

Conclusion: Findings support developers in launching useful innovations at the right time, reducing redundancy, and understanding ecosystem trends. A dataset accompanies the study to facilitate further research and strategy development.

Abstract: GitHub Marketplace is expanding by approximately 41% annually, with new
tools; however, many additions replicate existing functionality. We study this
phenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by
linking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.
Our graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,
and clusters redundant tools. We find that approximately 65% of new CI Actions
replicate existing capabilities, typically within six months, and that a small
set of first-mover Actions accounts for most subsequent forks and extensions.
These insights enable developers to choose the optimal moment to launch, target
unmet functionality, and help maintainers eliminate redundant tools. We publish

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge is an automated system for generating integration code for IoT devices, achieving high accuracy and coverage with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoT systems require significant human expertise to program integration code for diverse devices, creating a need to automate this process.

Method: AutoBridge uses a divide-and-conquer approach: generating device control logic and synthesizing platform-compliant code, supported by a multi-stage debugging pipeline with automated and user-assisted debugging.

Result: Evaluated on 34 devices across two platforms, AutoBridge achieved a 93.87% success rate and 94.87% function coverage on average, reaching 100% with minimal user feedback.

Conclusion: AutoBridge significantly simplifies IoT integration, outperforming expert programmers and demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for automating IoT development.

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges posed by autonomous business processes (ABPs) such as trust, debugging, accountability, bias, and regulatory compliance while fully leveraging their potential benefits.

Method: The authors propose a systematic approach to XABPs by characterizing explanation forms in ABPs, structuring explainability, and addressing research challenges in business process management.

Result: The proposed framework provides a foundation for crafting explainable autonomous workflows that enhance transparency, trust, and reliability.

Conclusion: XABPs are essential for mitigating risks and fully realizing the benefits of autonomous workflows by ensuring systems can explain their rationale effectively.

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent framework for issue resolution in software engineering that encourages diverse reasoning and improves issue localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for issue resolution using agent frameworks often fail due to being stuck in local solutions and lack identification of issue patterns spanning diverse parts of the codebase.

Method: The paper proposes SWE-Debate, which uses a competitive three-round multi-agent debate based on fault propagation traces across a code dependency graph. It ends with a consolidated fix plan implemented in an MCTS-based code modification agent.

Result: SWE-Debate outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the SWE-bench benchmark, with significant improvements over baseline frameworks.

Conclusion: The structured competition among agents in SWE-Debate highlights its advantage in achieving diverse reasoning paths and consolidated issue localization, establishing its effectiveness in complex software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Exp, an enhanced approach enabling LLM agents to retain and reuse knowledge for software issue resolution, achieving state-of-the-art results and paving the way for experience-driven problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model agents lack memory retention and fail to adapt previous repair methods to similar issues, leading to redundant exploration and inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed SWE-Exp framework builds an experience bank that records both successful and failed problem-solving attempts, extracting multi-level reusable knowledge for continuous learning.

Result: SWE-Exp achieves a leading resolution rate of 41.6% Pass@1 on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness under open-source agent frameworks.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp sets a new paradigm by introducing strategic, experience-driven problem resolution, enabling automated software engineering agents to leverage retained knowledge for improved issue resolution efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches in exploring large ensemble spaces and achieving repository-level understanding for issue resolution.

Method: Developed Trae Agent, which uses modular agents (generation, pruning, selection) to approach the issue resolution problem as an optimal solution search task.

Result: Trae Agent outperformed state-of-the-art methods with a 10.22% average improvement in Pass@1 and achieved first place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard.

Conclusion: Trae Agent effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based issue resolution and is released as an open-source resource for the research community.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

### [296] [An Empirical Study on the Amount of Changes Required for Merge Request Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23640)
*Samah Kansab,Mohammed Sayagh,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores code review (CR) effort in GitLab Merge Requests (MRs) by focusing on post-submission code modifications in a dataset of 23,600 MRs. It trains a predictive model to highlight key effort drivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It aims to address the lack of research on the effort involved in code review, especially in relation to the volume of code changes in GitLab MRs.

Method: Using data from over 23,600 GitLab MRs, the authors define CR effort based on code modifications and train a machine learning model incorporating dimensions like text, complexity, experience, and review history.

Result: They discover that 71% of MRs require post-submission changes, and 28% involve over 200 lines of code changes. Machine learning achieves an AUC of 0.84-0.88 and identifies complexity and experience as primary drivers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the practicality of using machine learning to anticipate and explain the effort associated with CR in software development.

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

*John J. Briguglio,Jaesung Lee,Albert K. Lee,Vincent Hakim,Sandro Romani*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Power-law scaling in neural data, typically linked to criticality, is shown to arise from the clustering process itself rather than critical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand the origin of power-law scaling in neural activity data, which is often associated with criticality, and to determine whether this scaling requires critical interactions.

Method: The authors analyzed neural activity during spatial navigation using a Phenomenological Renormalization Group (PRG) procedure. This involved clustering units based on activity similarity, applying the method to both recorded neural data and simulated heterogeneous, non-interacting units.

Result: The power-law scaling seen in neural data can be reproduced using the PRG on non-interacting, spatially structured units. The scaling exponents match those observed in neural data, showing that the procedure itself induces the scaling.

Conclusion: Power-law behavior in neural activity does not necessarily indicate criticality but can arise from methodological clustering and system heterogeneity. The findings challenge interpretations linking such scaling directly to critical dynamics.

Abstract: Power-law scaling in coarse-grained data suggests critical dynamics, but the
true source of this scaling often remains unclear. Here, we analyze neural
activity recorded during spatial navigation, reproducing power-law scaling
under a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure that clusters
units by activity similarity. Such scaling was previously linked to
criticality. Here, we show that the iterative nature of the procedure itself
leads to the emergence of power laws when applied to heterogeneous,
non-interacting units obeying spatially structured activity without requiring
critical interactions. Furthermore, the scaling exponents produced by
heteregeneous non-interacting units match the observed exponents in recorded
neural data. A simplified version of the PRG further reveals how heterogeneity
smooths transitions across scales, mimicking critical behavior. The resulting
exponents depend systematically on system and population size, predictions
confirmed by subsampling the data.

*Md Kaosar Uddin,Nghi Nguyen,Huajun Huang,Duy Duong-Tran,Jingyi Zheng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study proposes the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence as a novel, flexible metric for comparing functional connectomes. It outperforms traditional and advanced geodesic distance metrics, especially in high-dimensional settings, improving individual identification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like Pearson correlation and geodesic distances have shortcomings in capturing the complex geometry of functional connectomes, limiting neuropsychiatric research progress.

Method: The Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence was introduced as a new metric, evaluated against traditional and advanced metrics under varying conditions using the Human Connectome Project dataset.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperformed existing metrics, especially in high-dimensional scenarios, showing robustness without the need for extensive parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The Alpha-Z divergence is a reliable and generalizable tool for analyzing functional connectivity, enhancing sensitivity in linking patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs)
is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric
research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations
in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to
suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have
introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance
is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and
task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence,
which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison.
Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning
and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions
and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional
(e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g.,
affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically
investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance
performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the
proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional
and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied,
and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies
degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across
resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These
findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and
generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced
sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

*David Papo,Javier M. Buldú*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of complex network structures in understanding brain pathology and recovery, proposing that network analysis can shed light on functional and dysfunctional aspects of the brain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how understanding brain as a complex network can clarify the implications of network structure in brain pathologies and recovery.

Method: Discussion and analysis of the interplay between brain network properties, pathology definitions, and functional relevance.

Result: The analysis showed that network properties could be relevant to the understanding of brain diseases and recovery likelihood.

Conclusion: Examining brain disease as a network problem reveals insights into both brain pathology and functional brain activity, with clinical implications.

Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it
has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a
structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain
dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain
damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network
diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex
network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also
subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how
the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this,
in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to
brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not
only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on
functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the phase retrieval problem by analyzing and improving a previously unstable algorithm using a smoothing framework for better stability and superlinear convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval is challenging due to instability and limited theoretical guarantees in existing algorithms, necessitating improvements in stability and convergence.

Method: The authors reveal that the BWGD method is akin to Newton's method for nonconvex problems and introduce a smoothing framework to regularize the objective function.

Result: The proposed method showed stability with superlinear convergence guarantees in theory and superior performance in synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: This smoothing approach resolves inherent instabilities and advances the theoretical understanding and practical efficiency of phase retrieval algorithms.

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

*Wenhai Cui,Xiaoting Ji,Wen Su,Xiaodong Yan,Xingqiu Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness concerns in Individualized Treatment Rules (ITRs) and proposes methods to ensure demographic parity and balance between fairness and optimization using optimal transport theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITRs may lead to biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes, necessitating approaches to ensure fairness while retaining their effectiveness in applications like precision medicine and advertising.

Method: The authors propose a method leveraging optimal transport theory to transform optimal ITRs into fair ITRs, introduce adjustable trade-off parameters for balancing fairness and optimization, and determine a smoothed fairness constraint for enhanced parameter estimation.

Result: The proposed method was validated via extensive simulations and practical application in a real-world dataset, establishing its efficacy in balancing fairness and value optimization.

Conclusion: This approach provides a flexible framework for ensuring demographic parity in ITRs, allowing adaptability in fairness constraints while minimizing value loss.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining rule-based and AI methods with uncertainty quantification to remove sensitive data from medical imaging files, ensuring secure and ethical data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets contain sensitive PHI/PII that restricts their ethical sharing, limiting advancements in healthcare research.

Method: The framework integrates rule-based approaches, fine-tuned large language models, and uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN models to de-identify PHI/PII from metadata and pixel data.

Result: Demonstrated compliance with DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA standards while achieving reliable de-identification performance across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, confidence-informed solution for secure imaging data sharing, promoting ethics and trustworthiness in healthcare research.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to classify artists in the ticket resale market using dynamic pricing patterns modeled as Beta distributions. It also explores improvements to Random Forest classifiers through implicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding distinct economic signatures in ticket resale markets can provide insights into pricing strategies and market behavior.

Method: The authors used ticket pricing data modeled as scaled Beta distributions and estimated parameters via quantile matching and the method of moments. These parameters were integrated into Random Forest classifiers.

Result: The approach achieved high classification accuracy for artists based on ticket pricing distributions and demonstrated improvements in Random Forest model robustness through implicit regularization features.

Conclusion: The study highlights unique economic patterns in the ticket resale industry and demonstrates how advanced modeling techniques can enhance classification accuracy and model robustness.

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

### [304] [Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768)
*Nathan Wycoff,Ali Arab,Lisa O. Singh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for transfer learning that uses a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters to improve uncertainty quantification and prediction, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current transfer learning methods when both target and source datasets are scarce and poorly aligned, in order to improve statistical modeling under such constraints.

Method: The paper constructs a joint prior for parameters of both target and source datasets by using a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters. It leverages Bayesian Lasso in a transformed space and employs Gibbs sampling for model averaging.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior predictive performance over frequentist baselines, especially in settings with limited source data, as shown through a genetics application.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances Bayesian uncertainty quantification, bridges gaps with minimax-frequentist approaches, and offers computational scalability for moderately sized datasets.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

### [305] [On the Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Nonconvex Simple Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23155)
*Jincheng Cao,Ruichen Jiang,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses bilevel optimization with nonconvex objectives, introducing a first-order algorithm ensuring stationarity for both levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding efficient solutions for nonconvex bilevel optimization problems without relying on structural assumptions like convexity.

Method: It proposes a dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) variant to find $(\epsilon_f, \epsilon_g)$-stationary points.

Result: The algorithm achieves complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}}, \epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, ensuring joint stationarity for general nonconvex problems.

Conclusion: This is the first discrete-time algorithm providing complexity guarantees for achieving stationarity in nonconvex bilevel settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

TL;DR: This paper formalizes linear algebra calculations as morphisms in monoidal semiadditive categories and extends the framework for higher-rank tensors using semiadditive 2-categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, index-free framework for linear algebra suitable for functional programming and parallel computation.

Method: The authors utilize category theory, extending matrices to morphisms in $
\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$, and generalize to semiadditive 2-categories to include higher-rank tensors.

Result: A universal and generalizable linear algebra framework spanning matrices and tensors using category theory is constructed.

Conclusion: The paper provides an advanced formalism for linear algebra that supports programming efficiency, parallelization, and theoretical extensions.

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique to combat fake videos by embedding subtle, coded modulations in scene illumination that encode natural scene information, making forgery more difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing difficulty in distinguishing fake videos from real ones due to advancements in manipulation tools, creating an urgent need for more effective verification methods, especially in high-stakes settings.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes coded illumination to embed a temporal watermark in videos, which encodes an unaltered view of the scene. This method is designed to put adversaries at an informational disadvantage even if they are aware of the technique.

Result: The technique successfully creates a challenging scenario for adversaries, requiring them to solve a more complex problem to develop plausible fake videos, thereby enhancing the ability to detect manipulation.

Conclusion: This method of incorporating coded illumination creates an effective safeguard against video manipulation, particularly for scenarios where the content is vulnerable to high-stakes forgery and cameras cannot be controlled.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

### [308] [XSpecMesh: Quality-Preserving Auto-Regressive Mesh Generation Acceleration via Multi-Head Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23777)
*Dian Chen,Yansong Qu,Xinyang Li,Ming Li,Shengchuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces XSpecMesh, a method for accelerating auto-regressive mesh generation models while maintaining high quality, achieving a 1.7x speedup using multi-head speculative decoding and distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-regressive models for mesh generation suffer from significant inference latency due to the need for large numbers of sequential next-token predictions.

Method: XSpecMesh introduces multi-head speculative decoding to predict tokens in parallel, employs a verification/resampling strategy for quality assurance, and utilizes a distillation strategy to improve speculative prediction success.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 1.7x speedup in inference without compromising the quality of generated meshes.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh maintains quality while significantly reducing inference time, presenting advancements in the efficiency of auto-regressive mesh generation. The code will be released for further research.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

### [309] [Spatiodynamic inference using vision-based generative modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22256)
*Jun Won Park,Kangyu Zhao,Sanket Rane*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision transformer-driven variational encoding framework to preserve spatiotemporal complexities in biological systems and infer parameters via a likelihood-free Bayesian approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems are complex, and traditional inference approaches often sacrifice their richness for easier parameter identification, posing a challenge in analytical reliability.

Method: The authors propose a simulation-based inference framework using vision transformer-driven variational encoding, creating a structured mesh of latent embeddings for parameter space exploration and Bayesian inference.

Result: The framework generates structured latent representations from simulated dynamics and accurately retrieves parameter values corresponding to observed data.

Conclusion: The presented framework unifies generative modeling and Bayesian inference to effectively analyze complex spatiotemporal patterns in multivariate dynamical systems.

Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose
underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge.
Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality
reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and
interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter
identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting
mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for
analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical
systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework
that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact
representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies.
These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free
Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a
fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics
through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of
latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter
values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling
with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework
to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate
dynamical systems.

*Vincent Cohen-Addad,Alessandro Epasto,Jason Lee,Morteza Zadimoghaddam*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient distributed algorithm for enforcing user-level differential privacy on massive datasets by modeling complex ownership structures with hypergraphs to balance scalability and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern datasets often have records owned by multiple users, posing challenges for ensuring user-level differential privacy and scalable computation.

Method: The authors model user-record ownership using hypergraphs, implement contribution bounding via parallel proposals, and secure consensus among record owners to limit individual contributions.

Result: The proposed method efficiently adds records to datasets, maximizing utility while adhering to user-level privacy constraints on large-scale data.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a scalable, practical solution for user-level differential privacy in massive datasets, achieving high utility through hypergraph-based modeling and consensus-driven record addition.

Abstract: In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing
user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total
contribution. This "contribution bounding" becomes a significant combinatorial
challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally
intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address
this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed
algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph,
where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in
rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the
final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that
no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to
maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a
practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large,
real-world systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates topic models, specifically BERTopic, through 1140 model runs to understand parameter trade-offs and promote responsible use by highlighting interpretative concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topic models, while widely used for summarizing unstructured text, risk being misinterpreted as 'black boxes' due to lack of scrutiny. This paper aims to critically evaluate them to support responsible usage.

Method: The authors conducted 1140 BERTopic model runs to assess the effects of different parameter choices and derive insights about optimization trade-offs.

Result: Findings reveal the impact of parameter adjustments on the effectiveness of topic models and highlight areas requiring careful interpretation to avoid misleading conclusions.

Conclusion: Critical evaluation of topic models is crucial for responsible usage, as understanding parameter trade-offs aids in better interpreting the output and maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an
accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a
database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal
is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

### [312] [Are Recommenders Self-Aware? Label-Free Recommendation Performance Estimation via Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23208)
*Jiayu Li,Ziyi Ye,Guohao Jian,Zhiqiang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Qingyao Ai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiDu, a method to measure recommender system self-awareness by quantifying uncertainty as a label-free indicator of performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more transparent and self-evaluating recommender systems by assessing performance without user involvement, through a self-awareness metric.

Method: They propose LiDu, a probability-based method that calculates uncertainty by evaluating the likelihood of generating specific ranking lists from item prediction distributions.

Result: Experiments show that LiDu correlates better with recommendation performance than other label-free estimators and offers insights into the dynamic states of models during training and inference.

Conclusion: LiDu facilitates understanding of recommendation performance through uncertainty quantification, marking progress towards more self-aware and transparent systems.

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

### [313] [Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23209)
*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntervalLLM, a framework that integrates dynamic time intervals into LLM-based sequential recommendation tasks for improved performance, addressing both warm- and cold-start challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations in sequential recommendation approaches, where static assumptions about time intervals often miss the dynamic nature of user behaviors and intervals.

Method: The proposed IntervalLLM integrates interval-infused attention in large language models (LLMs) to jointly consider item and interval information. It also introduces an interval-based cold-start evaluation metric.

Result: IntervalLLM outperformed traditional and LLM-based baselines by 4.4% in average improvements across 3 benchmarks, excelling in both warm and cold scenarios in terms of users, items, and intervals.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the efficacy of incorporating dynamic interval information into recommendation tasks and underscore the need for further research on interval-based cold-start challenges.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

### [314] [KLAN: Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23459)
*Fan Li,Chang Meng,Jiaqi Fu,Shuchang Liu,Jiashuo Zhang,Tianke Zhang,Xueliang Wang,Xiaoqiang Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) as a new task in recommender systems and proposes KLAN, a framework for providing personalized landing pages. Experiments demonstrate increased user engagement, and deployment impacts millions of users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing research, which focuses more on in-page interactions and sequential recommendations (Stage II), rather than on page navigation (Stage I), even though effective page navigation could significantly enhance user engagement.

Method: The paper introduces KLAN, a hierarchical framework with three components: (1) KLAN-ISP for capturing static page preferences across days, (2) KLAN-IIT for capturing dynamic interest transitions within the day, and (3) KLAN-AM for adaptively integrating the two for personalized landing page recommendations.

Result: The proposed method, KLAN, improves key performance metrics such as Daily Active Users (DAU) by +0.205% and user Lifetime (LT) by +0.192% based on online experiments conducted on the Kuaishou platform.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PLPM and the KLAN framework are effective solutions for improving personalized navigation and user engagement in multi-page online platforms. The approach has been deployed successfully and impacts hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study introduces dynamic parameters based on SSCFs for enhancing Vietnamese ASR and shows improved performance and gender independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by leveraging the dynamic characteristics of speech signals and minimizing spectral variation.

Method: Characterizing acoustic transitions using polar parameters of SSCFs, combining these dynamic parameters with MFCCs, and using SSCF0 as a pseudo-feature for tonal information.

Result: The proposed parameters significantly reduced word error rates and demonstrated greater gender independence compared to standard MFCCs.

Conclusion: Dynamic parameters based on SSCFs enhance the performance of Vietnamese ASR by capturing detailed spectral and tonal information effectively.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MECAT, a benchmark for fine-grained audio understanding and a new evaluation metric, DATE, to assess detailed and discriminative audio-language model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-language models struggle with nuanced comprehension due to insufficient benchmarks and evaluation metrics that fail to draw distinctions between generic and detailed outputs.

Method: The authors use a pipeline combining expert model analysis and Chain-of-Thought reasoning by large language models to generate fine-grained captions and open-set QA pairs, alongside the introduction of the DATE metric that balances similarity and discriminability.

Result: The proposed benchmark and metric improve the evaluation of audio-language models' performance and expose insights about their limitations and capabilities.

Conclusion: MECAT, along with DATE, provides a more reliable framework to advance nuanced audio-language understanding by promoting precision in detailed comprehension and fostering comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoIndexer, a framework combining workload compression, query optimization, and RL models to improve database index selection scalability, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Select database indexes effectively for large-scale analytical workloads while addressing scalability challenges in RL-based advisors due to large action spaces.

Method: AutoIndexer integrates workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to optimize index selection by reducing complexity without compromising quality.

Result: AutoIndexer reduces query execution time by up to 95% and outperforms existing RL-based advisors in workload cost savings by ~20%, while cutting tuning time by over 50%.

Conclusion: AutoIndexer offers a practical and effective solution for database index configuration, showing promise for large-scale and varied workloads.

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

TL;DR: This paper reflects on the author's experience creating two music albums using AI music generation platforms, exploring the interaction between human creativity and AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the artistic and philosophical implications of using advanced AI platforms for music creation.

Method: The author created two experimental music albums using state-of-the-art AI platforms, engaged in a self-interview mediated by a large language model, and reflected on their changing musical identity.

Result: Insights about the limits of AI music generation, the evolving definition of authorship, and new artistic possibilities were uncovered.

Conclusion: The work prompts deeper thinking about the role of human identity and creativity in the face of increasingly capable AI, with LLM-mediated self-reflection offered as a valuable methodology.

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

Motivation: The development of efficient, cost-effective TCMs is crucial for advancing technologies like solar cells and displays.

Method: The study utilizes an extended FMA framework with improvements including binarization, Hopfield networks, adaptive random flips, and bit-string local search for material composition optimization.

Result: The proposed method outperformed Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms in speed and accuracy, while excelling in multi-objective optimization for band gap and formation energy.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for handling complex material search problems, contributing to advancements in materials informatics.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hardware-suited AI approach leveraging low-power CNN and Bayer image processing for efficient image classification on medical devices (video capsule endoscopy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient AI solutions on constrained hardware like sensor edge devices and minimizing energy consumption during medical procedures such as video capsule endoscopy.

Method: The paper utilizes a CNN with just 63,000 parameters combined with Viterbi decoding for Bayer image classification, alongside a customized ultra-low power PULPissimo System-on-Chip.

Result: The approach achieves 93.06% classification accuracy with significantly reduced energy usage, consuming only 5.31 μJ per image.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively extends battery lifetime by saving 89.9% energy, enabling resource-efficient AI for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

*Huayu Fu,Jiamin Li,Haozhi Qu,Xiaolin Hu,Zengcai Guo*

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural network-based framework for better segmenting neuronal data from images by addressing key challenges in morphology and occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently segmenting neuronal topology is crucial for managing large neuroimaging datasets, but challenges arise due to the complex structure of neurons and overlapping regions.

Method: The authors propose a deep network for creating pixel-level embeddings, design a custom loss function for segmentation, and develop a complete pipeline that converts raw images into structured trees. They also introduce a new topological metric to evaluate segmentation.

Result: Their method, tested on the fMOST imaging dataset, significantly reduces error rates compared to classical approaches in reconstructing neuronal topology.

Conclusion: The framework enhances neuron segmentation accuracy by addressing occlusion issues and provides better tools for quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a large-scale multi-center MRI dataset focusing on domain generalization in pancreas segmentation, outperforming prior methods with innovative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreas segmentation in medical imaging faces challenges due to its irregular shape, proximity to other organs, and variability across T1 and T2 sequences in MRI scans.

Method: The study introduces a dataset of 563 MRI scans from six institutions, accompanied by a semi-supervised approach using anatomical invariances to address domain generalization issues.

Result: The semi-supervised method achieved substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy with a Dice score increase of 61.63% and achieved 87.00% accuracy on test centers across sequences.

Conclusion: PancreasDG establishes a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging and offers critical insights into handling cross-center and cross-sequence variations more effectively.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in satellite image resolution by developing a method to harmonize Landsat and Sentinel imagery for improved resolution and downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in spatial resolution discrepancies among satellite sensors for enhanced geospatial analysis and applications.

Method: The authors create a framework to align Landsat-Sentinel 30m imagery using Sentinel 10m imagery as a high-resolution reference from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) dataset.

Result: The new method demonstrates effectiveness in bridging the resolution gap by producing improved super-resolved Landsat imagery, supported by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility of heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and offers insights for further advancements in enhancing satellite-based geospatial analysis.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

*Jamil Fayyad,Nourhan Bayasi,Ziyang Yu,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LesionGen, a diffusion-based model for generating synthetic dermatology images using detailed captions, achieving classification performance comparable to real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large, diverse, and annotated dermatology datasets due to privacy, cost, and representation challenges.

Method: Proposes LesionGen, utilizing fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models trained on structured dermatological captions created from expert annotations or pseudo-reports.

Result: Generated synthetic datasets allow for classification accuracy on par with real datasets and improved subgroup performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets, guided by rich, structured captions, can bridge gaps in dermatology image datasets and support robust model training.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon
PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First,
it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR
datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it
offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and
optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common

components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key
reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential
building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization
layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets
to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project
supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro

### [326] [Learning Arbitrary-Scale RAW Image Downscaling with Wavelet-based Recurrent Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23219)
*Yang Ren,Hai Jiang,Wei Li,Menglong Yang,Heng Zhang,Zehua Sheng,Qingsheng Ye,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a wavelet-based framework for arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling to improve detail preservation and overcome limitations of existing methods. They also propose a new dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image downscaling methods suffer from blurred details and artifacts in processed images within the sRGB domain. RAW images, with rich photonic data, lack effective downscaling frameworks, motivating the creation of a better solution.

Method: The authors propose a wavelet-based recurrent reconstruction framework. It employs a Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling Module (LASDM) and a High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM), coupled with energy-maximization loss, to efficiently downscale RAW images.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance in structural and textural integrity for RAW image reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in quantitative and visual evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling, offering robust solutions and introducing a useful dataset, Real-NIRD, for future benchmarking purposes.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EMedNeXt, a framework for robust brain tumor segmentation tailored for sub-Saharan Africa, addressing issues caused by resource constraints and poor MRI quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of manual tumor segmentation in under-resourced healthcare systems, particularly in low-income regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where MRI quality and radiologist expertise are limited.

Method: The proposed method, EMedNeXt, builds upon MedNeXt V2, leveraging deep supervision, architectural improvements based on nnU-Net v2, a larger region of interest, and a model ensembling system optimized for poor-quality MRI data.

Result: EMedNeXt was evaluated on a hidden validation set, achieving an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 and an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at tolerances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt demonstrates strong potential for improving brain tumor segmentation in resource-constrained environments, advancing diagnostic accuracy even with degraded-quality imaging.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve JPEG compression techniques, particularly focusing on chroma component preservation and reconstruction fidelity, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards.

Method: JPNeO uses neural operators integrated into both encoding and decoding stages to enhance image compression performance and artifact removal. It also aims to minimize memory usage and the number of parameters.

Result: JPNeO demonstrates superior reconstruction quality, reduced memory usage, and verifies the hypothesis of a space with high mutual information through empirical evidence.

Conclusion: JPNeO serves as a high-performance JPEG-based image compression algorithm, offering practical benefits without altering established source coding protocols.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores how continual learning (CL) can improve the adaptability of deep learning-based malaria diagnosis systems across different clinical sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria diagnostics in low-resource settings are challenged by limited access to expert microscopy, and existing automated systems lack generalization across various sites.

Method: The study investigates continual learning strategies, including rehearsal-based and regularization-based methods, applied to a YOLO-based object detector in a domain-incremental learning scenario using a multi-site dataset.

Result: Rehearsal-based CL methods demonstrated significant improvements in adapting CAD models to new sites while maintaining their previous performance.

Conclusion: Continual learning, especially rehearsal-based methods, holds promise for creating robust and deployable CAD tools for malaria diagnosis in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

*Liu Li,Qiang Ma,Cheng Ouyang,Johannes C. Paetzold,Daniel Rueckert,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a fast and efficient method for topology-aware medical image segmentation using the Euler Characteristic to preserve topological correctness while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based medical image segmentation methods struggle with clinically acceptable accuracy due to the lack of topological correctness, such as continuous boundaries or closed surfaces, which are critical in medical applications.

Method: The authors propose a novel segmentation approach that uses a fast computation of the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$) as a topological metric. They create topological violation maps to identify regions of topological errors and utilize a topology-aware correction network to refine these errors in segmentation networks.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves topological correctness while maintaining conventional pixel-wise segmentation accuracy, as demonstrated on both 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution to address topological constraints in medical image segmentation, making it a promising tool for clinically critical applications that demand both pixel-wise and topological accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

### [331] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper explores how presurgical brain dynamics predict cognitive outcomes in brain tumor patients post-surgery, achieving a 90% prediction accuracy using neural energy landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the post-surgery cognitive dysfunction in brain tumor patients by linking preoperative brain activity patterns to outcomes.

Method: Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to capture brain activity, and high-order energy landscapes were analyzed. Statistical and machine learning (random forest) models were employed to correlate these with working memory scores.

Result: The predictive model achieved 90% mean accuracy, 87.5% F1 score, and 0.95 AUC for working memory decline post-surgery. More extreme energy shifts correlated with worse cognitive outcomes.

Conclusion: Presurgical brain dynamics offer a predictive measure for cognitive decline, enabling more personalized surgical and therapeutic interventions to reduce cognitive risks.

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper pitches a two-stage sensing framework for heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital (H2AD) MIMO systems to smartly detect multi-emitters, proposing innovative methods for target number sensing and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges of high energy consumption, cost, and complexity in massive MIMO systems and enable smart sensing of the number and direction of multiple emitters.

Method: The two-stage sensing framework involves three target sensing methods (eigen-domain clustering, a DNN with statistical features, and a 1D-CNN) and a DOA estimation method (OMC-DOA). Theoretical groundwork is laid with a derived CRLB for the H2AD.

Result: The proposed methods achieved 100% accuracy in sensing target numbers at moderate-to-high SNRs and showed robustness against low SNR. Their DOA estimation method, OMC-DOA, surpassed existing clustering-based DOA schemes.

Conclusion: The developed methods significantly advance H2AD system functionalities for future wireless networks by offering accurate, low-cost, and efficient sensing solutions in multi-source scenarios.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmartCourse, a system designed to enhance undergraduate advising for Computer Science students by using AI for course recommendations based on transcript and plan data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional academic advising tools which lack integration of personal academic contexts (e.g., transcript and degree plans).

Method: Developed SmartCourse, a system combining a CLI, Gradio web GUI, and a locally hosted large language model to provide personalized course guidance. Introduced metrics to evaluate recommendation quality and tested the system under varying context scenarios.

Result: The system demonstrated that using a full academic context (e.g., transcript and plan data) enabled substantially more relevant course recommendations compared to modes that lacked context.

Conclusion: SmartCourse illustrates the effectiveness of context-aware AI in personalizing and improving academic advising for undergraduate students.

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can
enhance academic planning.

TL;DR: ELMES is an open-source framework designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational scenarios, addressing the lack of appropriate pedagogical assessment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the transformative potential of LLMs for education but recognizes the lack of suitable evaluation metrics specific to educational applications.

Method: The method involves a modular, open-source framework enabling customizable educational scenarios through simple configurations, and uses a 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approach for robust evaluation of subjective pedagogical metrics.

Result: Systematic benchmarking of advanced LLMs in four educational scenarios highlighted distinct strengths and weaknesses across models based on fine-grained, scenario-specific metrics.

Conclusion: ELMES helps educators and researchers evaluate LLM pedagogical capabilities effectively, promoting their real-world application in education while addressing the barriers to adopting LLMs in learning environments.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of associating new AI failure reports with documented incidents by developing an automated retrieval-based framework using transformer-based sentence embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of manual expert intervention in associating new AI failure reports with the existing AI Incident Database, which restricts scalability and delays the identification of failure patterns.

Method: The paper introduces a retrieval-based framework using semantic similarity through embedding cosine similarity, formalizing the task as a ranking problem. It benchmarks multiple models, including lexical methods and transformer-based sentence embeddings.

Result: Transformer-based sentence embedding models outperformed other approaches. Combining titles and descriptions boosted ranking accuracy, and the retrieval performance remained robust across description lengths and improved with larger training sets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and robust solution for maintaining the AI Incident Database, automating the association of failure reports and ensuring efficient identification of emerging issues.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

### [336] [Overcoming error-in-variable problem in data-driven model discovery by orthogonal distance regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23426)
*Lloyd Fung*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The study introduces ODR-BINDy, a new method combining orthogonal distance regression with a Bayesian framework for model discovery, addressing limitations in traditional methods like SINDy by better handling both regressand and regressor errors. Testing on systems like Lorenz63 shows its robust performance, even under high noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of discovering governing equations from noisy datasets using machine learning methods like SINDy, which underperform due to their simplistic error assumptions and hard constraint models.

Method: The researchers incorporate orthogonal distance regression (ODR) into a Bayesian framework for model selection, leading to the creation of ODR-BINDy. This method treats model equations as soft constraints, improving robustness compared to existing solutions like modified-SINDy and DySMHO.

Result: ODR-BINDy outperforms existing methods in recovering correct models from sparse and noisy datasets. For example, it reliably reconstructs the Lorenz63 system even with noise contamination levels reaching 30%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ODR-BINDy is a superior approach to model discovery in noisy datasets, offering enhanced accuracy and reliability over traditional methods such as SINDy under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that
promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there
remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One
reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all
noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time
derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors).
Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable
problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they
are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes
no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents
assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the
model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small
yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in
both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance
regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model
selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy,
and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63,
Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that
ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the
correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy
method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise
contamination levels of up to 30%.

### [337] [Barycentric subspace analysis of network-valued data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23559)
*Elodie Maignant,Xavier Pennec,Alain Trouvé,Anna Calissano*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA) for dimensionality reduction on unlabeled network data, aiming to enhance interpretability compared to traditional PCA approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction of unlabeled network data is challenging due to the lack of canonical node labeling, and traditional PCA-based methods have interpretability limitations.

Method: The authors propose BSA, which generates subspaces using sets of points. They also introduce a new embedding that uses equivalence classes of cospectral networks instead of isomorphic ones to represent the unlabeled networks.

Result: They demonstrate the effectiveness of BSA using both simulated and real-world network datasets and compare its performance to tangent PCA.

Conclusion: BSA provides a more interpretable and computationally feasible approach for dimensionality reduction on unlabeled networks, offering an alternative to PCA-based methods.

Abstract: Certain data are naturally modeled by networks or weighted graphs, be they
arterial networks or mobility networks. When there is no canonical labeling of
the nodes across the dataset, we talk about unlabeled networks. In this paper,
we focus on the question of dimensionality reduction for this type of data.
More specifically, we address the issue of interpreting the feature subspace
constructed by dimensionality reduction methods. Most existing methods for
network-valued data are derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and
therefore rely on subspaces generated by a set of vectors, which we identify as
a major limitation in terms of interpretability. Instead, we propose to
implement the method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), which relies
on subspaces generated by a set of points. In order to provide a
computationally feasible framework for BSA, we introduce a novel embedding for
unlabeled networks where we replace their usual representation by equivalence
classes of isomorphic networks with that by equivalence classes of cospectral
networks. We then illustrate BSA on simulated and real-world datasets, and
compare it to tangent PCA.

### [338] [Impact of a Lower Limb Exosuit Anchor Points on Energetics and Biomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23579)
*Chiara Lambranzi,Giulia Oberti,Christian Di Natali,Darwin G. Caldwell,Manuela Galli,Elena De Momi,Jesùs Ortiz*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of anchor point placements in exosuits on gait kinematics, muscular activation, and energy consumption, emphasizing the necessity for personalized configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the often-overlooked role of anchor point placement in exosuit design and its significant impact on the human body's reaction to assistance forces.

Method: The study conducted six experiments on 11 subjects using the XoSoft exosuit in five configurations. Data were collected through IMU-based motion tracking, EMG sensors, and metabolic consumption measurement.

Result: The optimal knee-anchor on the posterior side and hip-anchor on the anterior side reduced hip flexor muscle activation by 10.21% and metabolic expenditure by 18.45%. However, kinematic changes occurred in other joints, and no configuration universally served all subjects.

Conclusion: Exosuit anchor point positions significantly affect effectiveness and efficiency; however, achieving optimal performance requires subject-specific tailoring based on individual musculoskeletal differences.

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate visualization code and understand visualizations, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how effectively LLMs can assist with visualization tasks like code generation for visualizations and understanding visualizations by answering questions.

Method: The authors tested various popular LLMs on generating visualization code for common visualizations and on answering questions about visualizations to assess their capabilities.

Result: LLMs successfully generated simple visualizations like bar and pie charts and answered basic questions about visualizations. However, they struggled with complex visualizations such as violin plots and answering more intricate questions.

Conclusion: Insights from the study can guide improvements in both LLMs and Information Visualization systems, addressing their current limitations.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

### [341] [Invisible Architectures of Thought: Toward a New Science of AI as Cognitive Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22893)
*Giuseppe Riva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Cognitive Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) to understand AI systems reshaping human cognition and epistemic agency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research identifies that current human-AI studies fail to address the pre-conscious influence of AI systems, which significantly impacts distributed cognition.

Method: The authors introduce CIS to conceptualize AI systems as "cognitive infrastructures" and present narrative scenarios across different scales, combined with innovative methods like "infrastructure breakdown methodologies."

Result: The study shows how AI influences individual cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies, highlighting gaps in existing disciplines related to preprocessing analysis.

Conclusion: CIS provides an interdisciplinary framework to address AI's invisible influence, proposing new methodologies to understand its impact on cognition across scales.

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic systems' adaptability and performance post-deployment, allowing them to handle novel scenarios via learning from user interactions.

Method: The system employs natural dialogue, a 'chain of question' mechanism for clarifying user intent, and dual-modality retrieval modules to enhance learning and avoid repetitive errors before updates.

Result: Experimental evidence, both quantitative and qualitative, shows the system's effectiveness in adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: This innovative system sets an example for integrating interactive learning into robotics to enable better adaptability and user experience in various environments.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores the integration of robots in churches, focusing on social and non-financial impacts, and highlights potential roles while addressing mixed reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the under-examined role of robots in non-profit organizations like churches, where social benefits outweigh profit motives.

Method: The researchers partnered with a working church, conducted interviews with 15 stakeholders, and analyzed their perspectives using reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Mixed responses were observed, with concerns about empathy and unintended consequences, but also recognition of robots' potential in information sharing and reducing mundane tasks.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of considering both social and financial factors when integrating robots into socially-driven organizations.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service
sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less
attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where
social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore
these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor
attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of
stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of
introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using
reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a
robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church
has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However,
information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were
identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not
only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and
intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an
organisation.

TL;DR: The paper presents RecUserSim, a user simulator built on large language models (LLMs) to evaluate conversational recommender systems (CRS) with high realism and scoring capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing user simulators in reproducing diverse, real-world user interactions and providing quantitative ratings for CRS evaluation.

Method: RecUserSim combines a profile module for diverse user personas, a memory module for interaction history, and a core action module based on Bounded Rationality theory for nuanced decision-making. A refinement module further enhances response generation.

Result: Experiment results indicate that RecUserSim produces diverse, realistic dialogues and consistent ratings across different LLMs, even when using smaller base models.

Conclusion: RecUserSim effectively enhances CRS evaluation by achieving realism, diversity, and quantitative feedback, showing high potential for advancing this research domain.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Motivation: To understand the impact of AI code assistants on learning experiences and challenges faced by novice programmers.

Method: Students worked on a two-part exam: first with AI assistance and then without it, with data collected via Likert-scale and open-ended responses.

Result: AI tools boosted confidence and code comprehension but led to difficulty transferring knowledge to unaided tasks.

Conclusion: AI code assistants can aid novice programmers but require integrated pedagogical strategies to address overreliance and skill gaps.

Abstract: This exploratory study examines how AI code assistants shape novice

course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to
AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We
collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate
their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived
as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly
during initial development. However, students reported difficulties
transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and
gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for
pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing

TL;DR: The study tested an autonomous AI system, Doctronic, for virtual urgent care, showing it performed similarly to or better than human clinicians in many cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the looming shortage of healthcare providers and administrative tasks burdening clinical workflows, this paper explores the potential of AI to address these challenges.

Method: The authors retrospectively analyzed 500 virtual urgent-care telehealth encounters to compare AI-generated diagnostic and treatment accuracy with human clinicians' performance.

Result: The AI system achieved an 81% match in diagnosis and 99.2% alignment in treatment plans with clinicians, with no clinical hallucinations observed. Expert review deemed AI superior in 36.1% of discordant cases.

Conclusion: Multi-agent AI systems like Doctronic may provide a credible solution to alleviate healthcare provider shortages by functioning autonomously in specific clinical settings.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SketchMind, a modular AI framework for evaluating and improving scientific sketches drawn by students. It demonstrates higher performance (accuracy and feedback quality) compared to baseline models and emphasizes transparency and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI solutions for evaluating scientific sketches lack interpretability, alignment with educational goals, and adaptability to different cognitive levels, creating a need for a better framework.

Method: The researchers designed a multi-agent system called SketchMind with agents focused on tasks like rubric parsing, cognitive alignment, and providing iterative feedback for sketch improvement. They evaluated its performance on a dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches.

Result: SketchMind outperformed baseline models with a significant improvement in accuracy (+21.4% with SRG integration) and qualitative feedback ratings (4.1/5 vs. 2.3/5 for baseline models). Users and experts appreciated its capacity for supporting conceptual growth.

Conclusion: SketchMind enhances the evaluation of student-drawn sketches by combining modular, cognitively-aligned AI agents with an iterative feedback system. This framework shows promise for advancing AI-powered education and will be made available for future research.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

*Ismail Hossain,Mridul Banik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework integrating EEG-based brain-computer interfaces with large language models for real-time, personalized language rehabilitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAC systems and language-learning platforms are insufficient for real-time adaptation to individual user needs, especially in cases such as post-stroke aphasia or ALS.

Method: The framework combines EEG signals with language models to create a language rehabilitation assistant. It enables mental command-based navigation, personalizes learning content, and adapts exercises based on cognitive effort.

Result: The proposed approach potentially helps users with severe speech or motor impairments engage in tailored language learning with real-time feedback and personalized exercises.

Conclusion: The hybrid system shows promise for improving language rehabilitation for users with severe impairments, offering adaptability and personalization that conventional systems lack.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI system for voice-guided stroke evaluations by non-medical users, showing promising results but also requiring human oversight due to errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke recognition by first responders is inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to delays in treatment. This paper aims to address this critical gap in emergency stroke care.

Method: The paper tested a voice-driven AI system with three non-medical volunteers assessing ten simulated stroke patients. Metrics such as diagnostic accuracy, completion time, user confidence, and expert review of AI-generated reports were evaluated.

Result: The AI system correctly identified 84% of stroke signs, detected 75% of likely LVOs, and completed evaluations in just over 6 minutes. However, it flagged 2 out of 3 non-stroke cases incorrectly and had errors that limited expert confidence in treatment decisions.

Conclusion: While the AI system shows promise in improving stroke assessment, its current limitations underline the necessity of human oversight. Future advancements in speech-based AI models may enable more accurate and reliable systems for emergency medical care.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary

### [350] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework using large language models (LLMs) for automated label placement (ALP), supported by a new benchmarking dataset called MAPLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label placement on maps, critical for clarity, remains manual and challenging due to the lack of effective automated systems that adhere to cartographic standards and interpret context.

Method: The study formulates ALP as a data editing problem and uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with instruction-tuned large language models to determine label coordinates, aided by structured prompts and domain-specific guidelines.

Result: The proposed method was tested on the MAPLE dataset using four open-source LLMs, achieving accurate spatial annotation that aligns with expert cartographic standards, including zero-shot and instruction-tuned evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the scalability of LLMs in map label placement and highlights their potential in structured data editing tasks, representing a promising step toward AI-assisted map design.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of assessing accessibility in unfamiliar built environments in a scalable and personalized manner, particularly to benefit individuals with disabilities.

Method: The authors designed and evaluated Accessibility Scout, leveraging LLMs to identify accessibility concerns from photos and personalize results based on individual needs. They conducted three studies: a formative study, a technical evaluation, and a user study.

Result: Accessibility Scout demonstrated its ability to provide personalized accessibility scans tailored to individual mobility levels and preferences, outperforming traditional ADA considerations.

Conclusion: Accessibility Scout shows promise in scalable, personalized accessibility assessment and offers pathways for future research to improve adaptability and inclusivity in physical world accessibility.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching UML and ER diagrams is challenging due to students' difficulty in abstract thinking, syntax mastery, and limited scalability of traditional methods.

Method: DUET uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to convert diagrams into textual forms, compare them, and generate structured feedback to identify differences.

Result: Evaluation through interviews with educators and teaching assistants revealed strengths like scalability and learning support, though highlighted concerns like reliability and misuse.

Conclusion: DUET demonstrates the potential of LLMs in modeling education by supporting learning and informing teaching strategies, while also highlighting areas for improvement and future integration.

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

### [353] [Digital literacy interventions can boost humans in discerning deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23492)
*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study evaluates five interventions to improve people's ability to discern deepfakes, demonstrating effectiveness in boosting detection without harming trust in real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combatting the negative impact of deepfakes on institutions, elections, and overall trust, while addressing the lack of scalable digital literacy solutions.

Method: An experimental study involving 1,200 U.S. participants tested the immediate and long-term effectiveness of five different digital literacy interventions.

Result: The interventions improved participants' deepfake detection abilities by up to 13 percentage points, while maintaining their trust in real images.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches are scalable, effective, and applicable across diverse populations, enhancing digital literacy for detecting deepfakes without eroding confidence in authentic information.

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

Conclusion: The practical demonstration confirms the viability of CACC systems for real-world intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a tangible platform for demonstrating
the practical implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)
systems, an enhancement to the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept
by means of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. It involves a detailed
examination of existing longitudinal controllers and their performance in
homogeneous vehicle platoons. Moreover, extensive tests are conducted using
multiple autonomous experimental vehicle platform topologies to verify the
effectiveness of the controller. The outcomes from both simulations and field
tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach
in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a
notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on
simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating
these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms. This paper
seeks to fill this gap by providing a practical demonstration of CACC systems
in action, showcasing their potential for real-world application in intelligent

### [356] [An Information Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23218)
*Che Sun*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information bottleneck asset pricing model using deep neural networks (DNNs) to filter noise and retain critical data for accurate predictions in financial asset pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with overfitting to noisy financial data, degrading performance in complex asset pricing tasks.

Method: The proposed method imposes mutual information constraints during nonlinear mapping in DNNs to eliminate redundant, noisy data while preserving critical data for asset pricing.

Result: The model effectively filters noise, leverages DNNs' nonlinear modeling capabilities, and improves the precision of financial asset pricing.

Conclusion: Employing information bottleneck methods enhances deep networks by mitigating overfitting, enabling more accurate and noise-robust asset pricing predictions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework combining adjoint methods with AI-trained diffusion models for effective and high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in robust aerodynamic optimization, including ad hoc parameter tuning, variable scaling, and initialization robustness, using AI-generated priors.

Method: The framework utilizes adjoint gradients derived through shape derivatives and backpropagation via diffusion models trained on existing designs, leveraging automatic differentiation.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior aerodynamic performance, consistency in optimization across initializations, and eliminates manual tuning in transonic airfoil design tests.

Conclusion: AI-generated priors integrated with adjoint methods are effective for robust and automated aerodynamic shape optimization workflows.

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, for community detection in social network graphs through a novel framework called CommLLM, integrating semantic and graph structure information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional community detection methods are mainly reliant on graph structural properties. The authors aim to explore how recent advancements in LLMs could integrate semantic and contextual information into this task.

Method: The authors propose a two-step framework called CommLLM that combines GPT-4o model outputs with graph structural reasoning through prompt-based mechanisms. They validate the approach on six real-world datasets using key clustering metrics.

Result: CommLLM demonstrates that LLMs, with graph-aware strategies, effectively enhance community detection in small to medium-sized social graphs. The integration of instruction-tuned models and tailored prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of results.

Conclusion: LLMs hold strong potential for graph-based tasks, particularly community detection, when their interaction mechanisms are aligned with graph structures. This research suggests a promising direction for hybrid LLM-graph methodologies.

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detector energy response modeling for neutrino experiments by using neural likelihood estimation through simulation-based inference, utilizing JUNO as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise energy response modeling in next-generation neutrino experiments, hindered by the lack of analytical likelihoods, drives the development of a novel approach.

Method: The authors use simulation-based inference with neural density estimators (conditional normalizing flows and transformer-based regressors) and integrate these with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference in the JUNO experiment.

Result: The proposed method achieves statistically limited uncertainties with negligible systematic biases, offering both unbinned and binned likelihood analysis options for flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework sets a precedent for precise parameter inference in neutrino and particle physics experiments and allows researchers to adapt methods based on specific applications.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino
and broader particle physics.

Motivation: To address the rise in fraudulent activities in digital transactions and limitations of traditional detection methods.

Method: Combination of quantum-enhanced LSTM with federated learning and a novel privacy-preserving strategy called 'FedRansel' to tackle model degradation and attacks.

Result: The Quantum LSTM improves fraud detection by approximately 5%, with 'FedRansel' reducing attack effects and performance degradation by 4-8%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves fraud detection accuracy while preserving data security and mitigating privacy risks effectively.

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses prompt injection threats in LLM-based evaluation systems and proposes a solution using Counterfactual Evaluation alongside Standard Evaluation to detect such attacks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the vulnerabilities in LLM-based systems, where attackers can craft blind attacks that aim to deceive evaluators by producing misleading answers independent of the true ones.

Method: The authors introduce a framework combining Standard Evaluation (SE) and Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE) to assess submitted answers both under factual and deliberately altered conditions to identify potentially deceptive behavior.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the SE+CFE framework enhances the detection of blind attacks, outperforming standard evaluation methods with only minor impacts on performance.

Conclusion: Employing the SE+CFE approach strengthens the defense of LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection threats and mitigates the risks posed by blind attacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method using GPT-4-based LLMs to analyze infection screenshots from infostealer malware, identifying indicators of compromise, infection vectors, and malware campaigns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis and mitigation of the growing number of infostealer logs is impractical, and infection artifacts like screenshots remain underutilized for reactive threat analysis.

Method: Using the GPT-4o-mini model, the study analyzed screenshots of infected systems to extract actionable indicators of compromise, such as URLs, filenames, and infection themes.

Result: Out of 1000 screenshots analyzed, 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files were extracted, revealing three distinct malware campaigns and various malware distribution methods.

Conclusion: LLM-driven analysis shifts malware study from traditional log-based detection to artifact-driven methods, offering a scalable way to uncover infection workflows and improve threat intelligence.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.
