### [1] [Bidirectional RAG: Safe Self-Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation Through Multi-Stage Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22199)
*Teja Chinthala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bidirectional RAG is a new system that safely expands its knowledge base during operation using rigorous validation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems operate with static knowledge bases and lack the ability to evolve based on user interactions, limiting their potential for long-term improvement.

Method: The paper proposes Bidirectional RAG, which introduces a multi-stage acceptance layer with entailment verification, attribution checking, and novelty detection to validate and safely incorporate generated responses into the knowledge base.

Result: Bidirectional RAG achieves significantly higher coverage (40.58%) compared to Standard RAG (20.33%) while adding fewer documents (140 vs 500), showcasing its ability to safely evolve.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that self-improving RAG systems are feasible with proper validation processes, paving the way for smarter and adaptive language generation systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG systems enhance large language models by grounding responses in external knowledge bases, but conventional RAG architectures operate with static corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions. We introduce Bidirectional RAG, a novel RAG architecture that enables safe corpus expansion through validated write back of high quality generated responses. Our system employs a multi stage acceptance layer combining grounding verification (NLI based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection to prevent hallucination pollution while enabling knowledge accumulation. Across four datasets Natural Questions, TriviaQA, HotpotQA, Stack Overflow with three random seeds 12 experiments per system, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage nearly doubling Standard RAG 20.33% while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back 140 vs 500. Our work demonstrates that self improving RAG is feasible and safe when governed by rigorous validation, offering a practical path toward RAG systems that learn from deployment.

### [2] [Emergent Persuasion: Will LLMs Persuade Without Being Prompted?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22201)
*Vincent Chang,Thee Ho,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Shi Feng,Kellin Pelrine,Matthew Kowal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the risk of large language models (LLMs) persuading users without explicit prompts. It identifies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a significant factor increasing a model's tendency to persuade unprompted, even on harmful or controversial topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing use of conversational AI, concerns arise about LLMs influencing human beliefs, even in unintended or harmful ways. The authors aim to explore the conditions that lead to unprompted persuasion by these models.

Method: The authors study unprompted persuasion in two scenarios: (i) when using internal activation steering to simulate different persona traits, and (ii) when employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on persuasion-related datasets. They analyze how these approaches influence models' persuasive behavior.

Result: The study finds that persona steering does not reliably induce unprompted persuasion. However, SFT increases the model's likelihood of unprompted persuasion, including on controversial or harmful topics, even when trained on benign data.

Conclusion: The research underscores that supervised fine-tuning can lead to emergent risks of harmful persuasion in LLMs, highlighting the need for monitoring and further study of these emergent behaviors.

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

### [3] [GamiBench: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning and 2D-to-3D Planning Capabilities of MLLMs with Origami Folding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22207)
*Ryan Spencer,Roey Yaari,Ritvik Vemavarapu,Joyce Yang,Steven Ngo,Utkarsh Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GamiBench, a benchmark to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through origami-inspired folding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating the spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs, as current benchmarks mainly focus on static images or final outputs without considering the sequential and viewpoint-dependent aspects of this skill.

Method: GamiBench consists of 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes. It evaluates models across three visual question-answering tasks, introduces diagnostic metrics like viewpoint consistency and impossible fold selection rate, and holistically assesses the reasoning process.

Result: Leading MLLMs, like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, struggle with single-step spatial understanding as shown by experiments using GamiBench.

Conclusion: GamiBench serves as a standardized framework for assessing spatial reasoning and geometric understanding in MLLMs, offering insights into their limitations in this aspect.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

### [4] [Toward Equitable Recovery: A Fairness-Aware AI Framework for Prioritizing Post-Flood Aid in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22210)
*Farjana Yesmin,Romana Akter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework to equitably distribute post-flood aid in Bangladesh, addressing systemic biases through fairness-aware learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic biases in post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations, which disadvantage vulnerable regions and perpetuate inequities, particularly during flood disasters in Bangladesh.

Method: An adversarial debiasing model was developed using fairness-aware representation learning and gradient reversal layers to make flood vulnerability predictions while removing biases against marginalized areas. This approach uses real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods.

Result: The framework reduced statistical parity difference by 41.6%, decreased fairness gaps by 43.2%, and maintained strong predictive accuracy (R-squared = 0.784 compared to baseline 0.811).

Conclusion: The research shows that fairness-aware AI approaches can lead to more equitable post-disaster aid allocation, providing a tool for decision-makers to prioritize vulnerable populations based on need rather than historical bias.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

### [5] [With Great Capabilities Come Great Responsibilities: Introducing the Agentic Risk & Capability Framework for Governing Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22211)
*Shaun Khoo,Jessica Foo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The ARC Framework is introduced to help organizations govern the risks of agentic AI systems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges organizations face in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with agentic AI systems.

Method: The ARC Framework provides a capability-centric analysis of agentic AI, identifies key risk sources, links risks to controls, and offers practical implementation guidelines.

Result: The proposed framework provides clear mechanisms for managing diverse risks, ensuring responsible deployment of agentic AI.

Conclusion: The ARC Framework facilitates safe innovation in agentic AI systems while maintaining security and responsibility, making it adaptable for organizational use.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems. Our framework is open-sourced \href{https://govtech-responsibleai.github.io/agentic-risk-capability-framework/}{here}.

### [6] [We are not able to identify AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22236)
*Adrien Pavão*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study finds that humans struggle to differentiate AI-generated images from real ones, with an accuracy just above random guessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether humans can reliably distinguish between AI-generated and real images as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent online.

Method: An interactive web experiment involving 165 participants who classified real images and curated AI-generated images in 233 sessions.

Result: Participants had an average accuracy of 54%, slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement over time.

Conclusion: Human judgment alone is insufficient to discern real from AI-generated images, emphasizing the need for awareness and ethical guidelines as synthetic media evolves.

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

### [7] [Shape of Thought: When Distribution Matters More than Correctness in Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22255)
*Abhranil Chandra,Ayush Agrawal,Arian Hosseini,Sebastian Fischmeister,Rishabh Agarwal,Navin Goyal,Aaron Courville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study finds that using synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, even when they lead to incorrect answers, can improve reasoning capabilities in language models better than human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore methods to enhance reasoning abilities in language models by leveraging synthetic CoT traces, even when these traces lead to flawed outcomes.

Method: The paper conducts experiments wherein models are trained on synthetic CoT traces, including ones leading to incorrect answers, and compares these with results using human-annotated traces. Techniques such as paraphrasing human annotations and introducing flawed CoT traces are also tested for impact.

Result: Training on synthetic CoT traces improved model reasoning performance, even outperforming human-annotated data in some contexts. Model tolerance to flawed traces was analyzed, and performance gains were noted when traces were closer to the model’s data distribution.

Conclusion: Optimizing datasets to align with a model’s data distribution can enhance reasoning. Notably, accurate final answers don't always guarantee fidelity of reasoning, emphasizing the need to assess intermediate steps.

Abstract: We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.

### [8] [Lessons from Neuroscience for AI: How integrating Actions, Compositional Structure and Episodic Memory could enable Safe, Interpretable and Human-Like AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22568)
*Rajesh P. N. Rao,Vishwas Sathish,Linxing Preston Jiang,Matthew Bryan,Prashant Rangarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current foundation models excel in next-token prediction but lack brain-inspired components like integration of actions, hierarchical structure, and episodic memory, which could address deficiencies and pave the way for safer and more human-like AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between current foundation models and human brain-inspired predictive coding methods to address shortcomings such as hallucinations, lack of grounding, and interpretability issues in AI.

Method: The authors suggest integrating actions, hierarchical compositional generative architectures, and episodic memory into foundation models inspired by evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science.

Result: The proposed integration could mitigate issues like hallucinations, lack of agency, energy inefficiency, and safety concerns, offering a pathway for creating more interpretable and human-like AI systems.

Conclusion: A renewed exchange between neuroscience and AI research is essential for developing human-centered, safe, and interpretable AI systems that overcome current deficiencies in foundation models.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

### [9] [Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP): A Deterministic and Interpretable Prompting Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22258)
*Satvik Tripathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP), a framework enhancing large language models' rule adherence and interpretability. LSP outperforms other prompting techniques in pharmacologic compliance tasks, showing high accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tasks demanding strict adherence to rules, determinism, and auditability, which limits their effectiveness in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors propose Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP), a prompting framework with typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule-based validator. They benchmark its performance on pharmacologic compliance tasks versus other prompting methods using models like Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3.

Result: LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83-0.89) and F1 scores (0.83-0.89), far exceeding other methods. Statistical significance is confirmed via McNemar tests (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: LSP enhances the interpretability, determinism, and consistency of LLM outputs, making it suitable for clinical or safety-critical decision support systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

### [11] [Agent2World: Learning to Generate Symbolic World Models via Adaptive Multi-Agent Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22336)
*Mengkang Hu,Bowei Xia,Yuran Wu,Ailing Yu,Yude Zou,Qiguang Chen,Shijian Wang,Jiarui Jin,Kexin Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Yuan Lu,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World is a framework that generates symbolic world models for planning and improves them through adaptive multi-agent feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in training LLMs for generating symbolic world models due to the lack of verifiable supervision and static validation methods.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage pipeline involving a Researcher agent (knowledge synthesis), a Model Developer agent (world model implementation), and a Testing Team (adaptive unit testing and behavior validation).

Result: Agent2World achieves state-of-the-art results in benchmarks for PDDL and executable code representations and improves model performance through supervised fine-tuning with multi-agent feedback.

Conclusion: Agent2World enhances symbolic world model generation for planning tasks by integrating multi-agent workflows and adaptive testing, achieving significant performance gains.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on numeric planning with control parameters and proposes a compilation approach to handle infinite action possibilities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of standard numeric planning becoming infeasible when control parameters introduce infinite actionable possibilities.

Method: The authors identify controllable, simple numeric problems and introduce an optimistic compilation technique that abstracts control-dependent expressions into simpler forms for effective heuristic application.

Result: Their compilation approach enables the use of subgoaling heuristics in numeric planning tasks with control parameters, demonstrating feasibility and improved planning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the applicability of traditional numeric heuristics to previously intractable planning problems, advancing the current state of numeric planning techniques.

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

*Bhanu Prakash Vangala,Sajid Mahmud,Pawan Neupane,Joel Selvaraj,Jianlin Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucinations in AI, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a benchmark dataset (HalluMatData) and a framework (HalluMatDetector) for detection and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scientific discovery integrity amidst AI hallucinations, particularly in materials science, by developing reliable evaluation metrics and methodologies.

Method: The paper introduces HalluMatData for benchmarking and proposes HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection system using verification, retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and assessment metrics. It also introduces the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS).

Result: HalluMatDetector reduces hallucination rates in AI-generated materials science content by 30% compared to standard LLMs; PHCS provides deeper insights into response reliability.

Conclusion: The methods and dataset significantly improve detection and mitigation of hallucinations in AI, paving the way for more reliable scientific outputs.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

*Ozan Oguztuzun,Cerag Oguztuzun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GatedBias, a method to personalize foundation KG models by adapting frozen embeddings to capture individual user contexts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in KGs often fail to align general relational reasoning with individual user preferences, necessitating methods for efficient personalization without sacrificing performance.

Method: GatedBias uses structure-gated adaptation combining profile-specific features with binary gates to produce user-specific biases, requiring only ~300 additional parameters.

Result: The method shows statistically significant personalization improvements on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets while preserving overall accuracy; causal effects are validated through counterfactual experiments.

Conclusion: GatedBias bridges general KG models and user-specific personalization in a parameter-efficient, interpretable, and causally valid manner.

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

*Yifan Zhang,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel design paradigm for AI agents using algebraic structures from functional programming to improve state management, error handling, and concurrency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are often built with ad hoc patterns, leading to issues in managing state, handling errors, and orchestrating concurrent tasks effectively.

Method: MCE leverages Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to formalize the design of AI agent workflows. It introduces robust mechanisms for sequential and parallel processes, error handling, and modular composition via Monad Transformers.

Result: The proposed approach offers a systematic way to construct complex AI agents with robust, efficient, and testable workflows. It also extends to Meta-Agents capable of autonomously managing sub-agent workflows.

Conclusion: Monadic Context Engineering provides a powerful and modular framework for building autonomous AI systems, addressing key challenges in current agent architectures while enhancing resiliency and functionality.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DarkPatterns-LLM, a fine-grained benchmark for evaluating manipulative behaviors in large language models, highlighting weaknesses in autonomy-undermining detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have risen regarding manipulative or deceptive behaviors in Large Language Models which may harm user trust, autonomy, and well-being.

Method: A diagnostic framework with four analytical layers (MGD, MSIAN, THP, DCRA) and a dataset of 401 annotated examples across seven harm categories.

Result: Evaluations of models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 show performance disparities and challenges in detecting certain manipulative patterns.

Conclusion: DarkPatterns-LLM establishes a foundational benchmark to improve manipulation detection and make AI systems more trustworthy.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

*Yiming Lu,Tingyu Lu,Di Zhang,Lili Ye,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores aluminum nanoparticles as energy-dense fuels and introduces a self-auditing AI framework for accurate simulation of their combustion, leading to new insights into their oxidation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding atomic mechanisms of aluminum nanoparticles' explosive transition and overcoming computational limitations for modeling their reactive behavior.

Method: A 'human-in-the-loop' AI framework combines machine learning potential evolution with human decision-making to ensure quantum accuracy and scalable simulations.

Result: Simulations uncover a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism, demonstrate aluminum cation diffusion dominance, and resolve a controversy over the role of mass transfer.

Conclusion: The findings create a unified framework for designing energetic nanomaterials with precision in ignition sensitivity and energy release rates.

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SANet is a semantic-aware AI networking architecture for wireless networks designed to optimize decision-making with decentralized agents. It achieves notable performance boosts with reduced resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the decentralized nature of AgentNet and the need to address conflicts and multiple objectives among AI agents in complex network environments.

Method: The paper introduces SANet, formulates it as a multi-agent multi-objective optimization problem, defines new evaluation metrics, and proposes the MoPS framework to efficiently partition and share models among agents. It also develops and tests a hardware prototype for implementation.

Result: SANet demonstrates a theoretical three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflict errors, and achieves up to 14.61% better performance with only 44.37% of the computational load compared to competitors.

Conclusion: The proposed SANet architecture and framework provide a significant step forward in designing decentralized AI-native networks, effectively balancing agent collaboration, resource efficiency, and network optimization.

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Junshu Dai,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Wei Ji,Qinghong Guo,Ji Cao,Jie Song,Canghong Jin,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a method, M³ob, to improve human mobility prediction by utilizing multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge and addressing limitations in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome shortcomings in current human mobility prediction methods, such as data sparsity in unimodal approaches and the semantic gap in multimodal methods, for better socioeconomic applications.

Method: The authors propose (1) constructing a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using semantic and spatial-temporal knowledge, and (2) introducing a gating mechanism to fuse graph representations and cross-modal alignment.

Result: The method shows consistent improvements across six public datasets, excelling in both normal and abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of incorporating multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge for human mobility tasks, achieving better prediction and generalization.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

*Zhongyang Liu,Haoyu Pei,Xiangyi Xiao,Xiaocong Du,Yihui Li,Suting Hong,Kunpeng Zhang,Haipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SimVC-CAS, a system simulating venture capital (VC) decision-making using multi-agent interactions, which improves startup success prediction accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to better predict startup success rates, a critical issue considering the high value and failure rate of startups. Existing methods fail to address the collective dynamics of investor decision-making.

Method: The authors developed SimVC-CAS, a collective agent system with role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module to simulate VC group decisions using co-investment networks, capturing enterprise fundamentals and investor dynamics.

Result: SimVC-CAS demonstrated a 25% improvement in predictive accuracy (precision@10) by using data from PitchBook while adhering to strict data leakage controls.

Conclusion: SimVC-CAS offers a more effective, interpretable, and realistic approach to modeling startup success predictions, with broader applications in group decision scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

### [22] [The Wisdom of Deliberating AI Crowds: Does Deliberation Improve LLM-Based Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22625)
*Paul Schneider,Amalie Schramm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines the effectiveness of structured deliberation among large language models (LLMs), finding it improves accuracy in diverse model groups but not in homogeneous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether structured deliberation, known to improve human forecasting, can similarly enhance the performance of LLM predictions.

Method: Four scenarios (diverse and homogeneous LLM groups, with or without shared information) were analyzed using forecasts from the Metaculus AI Forecasting Tournament.

Result: Structured deliberation improved forecasting accuracy (Log Loss reduced by 0.020, ~4%) in diverse LLM groups (scenario 2) but showed no effect in homogeneous groups. Additional contextual information had no impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: Deliberation among diverse LLMs can improve forecasting accuracy, suggesting potential applications for refining AI model outputs.

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation framework called DICE for RAG systems, which focuses on explainability, robustness, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trustworthiness in RAG systems by addressing challenges of existing scalar metrics, such as limited interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and inefficiency in system comparisons.

Method: The authors propose DICE, a framework with a two-stage, evidence-coupled approach that uses a probabilistic scoring model and computationally efficient Swiss-system tournament.

Result: DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human expert evaluations in a Chinese financial QA dataset and demonstrates a 42.9% reduction in computational complexity while maintaining ranking accuracy.

Conclusion: DICE proves to be an effective method for responsible and interpretable evaluation of RAG systems, advancing their reliability and practical deployment.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in evaluating LLMs for travel planning, such as the lack of domain coverage and multi-turn interactions in previous benchmarks.

Method: The authors introduce TravelBench, which includes multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable tasks. They also provide a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools for stable evaluations.

Result: The study evaluates multiple LLMs on TravelBench, analyzing their behaviors and performance in dynamic, real-world travel-planning scenarios.

Conclusion: TravelBench sets a standard for reproducibly evaluating and improving LLM agents in multi-faceted travel planning tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

### [25] [Memento-II: Learning by Stateful Reflective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22716)
*Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper establishes a framework for continual learning in language model agents using a memory-based reflective process rather than traditional training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language models to adapt through continual learning without relying on backpropagation or fine-tuning during deployment.

Method: The paper introduces the Stateful Reflective Decision Process (SRDP), where agents use episodic memory in a two-stage read-write cycle for policy evaluation and improvement, connecting it mathematically to Markov Decision Processes.

Result: The model ensures convergence to optimal policies as episodic memory grows, supported by dynamic programming and reinforcement learning tools.

Conclusion: This framework enables memory-augmented, retrieval-based agents to adapt continually without requiring parameter updates, providing a foundation for practical, adaptive language models.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in portfolio optimization caused by regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the lack of interpretability in deep reinforcement learning.

Method: The proposed SAMP-HDRL methodology employs hierarchical deep reinforcement learning with dynamic asset grouping, upper and lower agent coordination, utility-based capital allocation, and SHAP interpretability to manage portfolio segmentation and risk allocation.

Result: SAMP-HDRL demonstrated superior performance across various market regimes (2019–2021), achieving at least 5% higher Return, Sharpe, and Sortino ratios, and 2% higher Omega ratio compared to the strongest benchmarks, particularly excelling in volatile markets.

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL enhances adaptability, robustness, and interpretability by embedding market structure constraints into the DRL pipeline, showcasing its effectiveness in complex financial environments.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiSciBench, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on scientific reasoning and discovery, offering hierarchical assessments across scientific inquiry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs fail to cover the comprehensive, hierarchical, and multi-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry. There's a need for a unified evaluation framework to assess diverse abilities required for scientific research.

Method: HiSciBench is proposed as a hierarchical benchmark comprising five levels of scientific workflow tasks. It includes 8,735 curated tasks across six scientific disciplines, supports multimodal inputs, and performs cross-lingual evaluations.

Result: Evaluations of models like GPT-5 and DeepSeek-R1 show that while models achieve reasonable accuracy on basic tasks, their performance deteriorates significantly on advanced scientific challenges.

Conclusion: HiSciBench is a critical tool for understanding and improving the scientific capabilities of models. It sets a new standard for assessing scientific intelligence and supports future research by highlighting performance gaps.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of existing models like Ultra, which rely on a single relational transformation, restricting their expressiveness in capturing diverse patterns on knowledge graphs.

Method: Gamma introduces multi-head geometric attention using parallel relational transformations (real, complex, split-complex, dual number) and a relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism with entropy regularization for more expressive knowledge graph reasoning.

Result: Gamma achieves a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks compared to Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Gamma's use of diverse geometric representations and adaptive relational bias increases expressiveness, proving its efficacy as a foundation model for knowledge graph reasoning.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

### [29] [Multimodal Fact-Checking: An Agent-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22933)
*Danni Xu,Shaojing Fan,Xuanang Cheng,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of multimodal misinformation by introducing a new dataset (RW-Post) and proposing a multimodal fact-checking framework (AgentFact) to improve both reasoning and evidence utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the major challenge of limited reasoning and shallow evidence usage in current automated multimodal fact-checking systems due to a lack of adequate datasets.

Method: Introduced the RW-Post dataset containing real-world multimodal claims with reasoning and evidence, and proposed AgentFact, an agent-based framework using iterative workflows for verification and explanation.

Result: The synergy of RW-Post and AgentFact showed improved accuracy and interpretability in multimodal fact-checking through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper provides a significant advancement in the field by creating both a dataset and framework that enhance real-world multimodal fact-checking systems, emphasizing better accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

### [30] [Problems With Large Language Models for Learner Modelling: Why LLMs Alone Fall Short for Responsible Tutoring in K--12 Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23036)
*Danial Hooshyar,Yeongwook Yang,Gustav Šíř,Tommi Kärkkäinen,Raija Hämäläinen,Mutlu Cukurova,Roger Azevedo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutors for learner modeling in K-12 education, comparing them with Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Results indicate DKT performs better and is computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by concerns about the misconception that LLM-based tutors can replace traditional learner modeling in high-risk domains like K-12 education.

Method: The study synthesizes evidence on LLM limitations and empirically compares a DKT model with LLMs (evaluated in zero-shot and fine-tuned modes) using a large dataset.

Result: DKT achieves a higher AUC (0.83) than the fine-tuned LLM by 6%. LLMs exhibit temporal inconsistencies and require extensive computational resources, unlike DKT.

Conclusion: LLMs are unlikely to match the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems like DKT for adaptive learning in K-12 education. Hybrid frameworks with learner modeling are needed for responsible tutoring.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

*Fady Rezk,Yuangang Pan,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Xun Xu,Nancy Chen,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of using standard reward models (RMs) for personalized alignment, showing they poorly translate user preferences into deployed behavior. New metrics and benchmarks are proposed, revealing systematic issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether standard reward model accuracy is sufficient for personalized alignment when controlled by reward-guided decoding (RGD) in deployment scenarios.

Method: Introduces policy accuracy as a metric for effective RGD alignment, performs systematic evaluation across datasets, and proposes Pref-LaMP for direct behavioral evaluation of personalized alignment.

Result: Finds that RM accuracy weakly correlates with behavioral alignment, and larger models show better performance with in-context learning (ICL) over reward-guided methods.

Conclusion: Current proxy metrics fail to predict real deployment performance; new metrics and benchmarks are needed to optimize personalized alignment effectively.

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of ChexReason, a vision-language model, in medical imaging with resource constraints. It highlights a trade-off in reinforcement learning by improving in-distribution performance but penalizing cross-dataset transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of research into the resource-constrained application of RL in medical imaging, especially for Large Language Models, despite advancements in reasoning tasks.

Method: The method involved creating ChexReason, a model trained with a resource-efficient approach (R1-style methodology: supervised fine-tuning followed by GRPO). The training utilized minimal samples (2,000 SFT, 1,000 RL) and hardware (a single A100 GPU).

Result: Experiments on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks showed an improvement in in-distribution performance (23%), but a 19% drop in cross-dataset transferability due to RL limitations. A paradox was found where fine-tuned models perform better on some tasks before optimization.

Conclusion: Supervised fine-tuning might be a more effective strategy than aggressive reinforcement learning for clinical applications, as it is better at preserving robustness across varying datasets and populations.

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

*Yu Li,Tian Lan,Zhengling Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques limitations in Direct Preference Optimization and proposes a new method, Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (Π). This method aims to enhance Large Language Models by leveraging intrinsic self-reflection and comparative information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization and its variants in aligning LLMs.

Method: Proposes Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (Π) as a plug-and-play enhancement, guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference policy choices, with no architectural changes or inference overhead.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness, human-aligned behavior, and better win rates with Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization.

Conclusion: Intrinsic self-reflection improves LLM alignment and performance, resolving foundational issues in existing preference optimization methods.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current methodologies for evaluating Emotional Intelligence (EI) in AI, highlighting the need for refined frameworks that adequately measure EI aspects in artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks do not comprehensively or accurately capture the aspects of Emotional Intelligence relevant to AI systems, which necessitates a refined approach.

Method: The authors first review theories on emotion and EI to understand their applicability to AI. They then critically assess available benchmark frameworks for evaluating EI in AI, identifying their limitations.

Result: The paper identifies gaps in current evaluation frameworks related to the foundational understanding of EI and proposes potential improvement strategies.

Conclusion: Refined evaluation strategies can better assess the Emotional Intelligence in artificial systems, addressing the current shortcomings and enhancing their applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

*Yifan Zhang,Giridhar Ganapavarapu,Srideepika Jayaraman,Bhavna Agrawal,Dhaval Patel,Achille Fokoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPIRAL, a framework combining language models and search algorithms to enhance planning tasks. It substantially outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with complex planning tasks due to their linear reasoning and inability to recover from early mistakes. Search algorithms are limited by sparse rewards and fail to utilize LLMs' semantic strengths.

Method: SPIRAL embeds three specialized LLM agents (Planner, Simulator, Critic) into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) loop. This integrates creative exploration, grounded outcome prediction, and dense reward reflection for guided and self-correcting planning.

Result: SPIRAL outperforms prior planning methods, with 83.6% accuracy on the DailyLifeAPIs dataset, improving by over 16 percentage points compared to competing frameworks, and demonstrates higher token efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with reflective and guided search processes significantly enhances autonomous planning, showcasing superior performance and efficiency. Reproducibility is supported via open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners. The source code, full appendices, and all experimental data are available for reproducibility at the official project repository.

### [36] [From Model Choice to Model Belief: Establishing a New Measure for LLM-Based Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23184)
*Hongshen Sun,Juanjuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'model belief,' a measure derived from LLM probabilities that efficiently captures belief distributions and offers better statistical performance than conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in using LLM outputs as single data points, which underutilizes the probabilistic nature and potential information from LLM-generated data.

Method: The authors propose and formalize 'model belief,' derived from token-level probabilities, and prove its equivalence to the mean of model choices. They also conduct a demand estimation study to showcase its practical effectiveness.

Result: Model belief reduces variance, converges faster, and predicts more accurately than model choice in practical applications. It also reduces the computational effort by a factor of 20.

Conclusion: Model belief is a more statistically efficient and effective tool for leveraging LLM-generated data, making it a preferred approach in settings with limited computation or runs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCEval, a unique framework to assess AI's cognitive abilities through thermal comfort scenarios, identifying gaps in current LLM capabilities for real-world reasoning and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a gap in task-specific benchmarks for evaluating real-world cognitive abilities of AI, specifically within the domain of thermal comfort, to enhance their human-centric applications.

Method: The authors developed TCEval, which involves virtual personality modeling of LLM agents generating thermal comfort decisions and validating their outputs against established databases. They tested four LLMs for cognitive capabilities.

Result: Results demonstrate that while LLMs show directional consistency to human feedback within a certain tolerance, they lack precise causal understanding, diverging significantly from human data in classification tasks.

Conclusion: TCEval serves as a feasible Cognitive Turing Test, highlighting foundational capabilities and limitations of current LLMs, and shifts AI evaluation towards real-world, context-aware applications.

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques the limitations of general-purpose AI models in physics control tasks and proposes domain-specific compact language models validated by physics rather than perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and input unfaithfulness of general-purpose foundation models (vision-language models) in safety-critical physical systems, as these models fail to ensure constraint-adherence and adequate accuracy.

Method: The proposed method involves designing compact language models focused on Agentic Physical AI. Training is conducted on synthetic reactor control datasets with scaled examples to demonstrate behavior stabilization and strategy selection. Physics-based validation replaces perceptual inference.

Result: The results show that large-scale deployment leads to a significant reduction in variance (over 500x), stabilization of execution behavior, strategic action selection, and effective cross-modal transfer without architectural changes.

Conclusion: Domain-specific, physics-driven foundational models offer superior control reliability compared to general-purpose AI models, with transformative implications for safety-critical systems.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties, proving bidirectional relationships between the two problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between conformant planning and hyperproperty model-checking, and explore their applications in system verification and planning.

Method: The authors develop formal reductions to show how model-checking of hyperproperties ($\exists^*\forall^*$) can be mapped to conformant planning, and vice versa, proving soundness and completeness of the transformations.

Result: The paper establishes a strong connection between the two domains by demonstrating that both problems can be transformed into one another efficiently.

Conclusion: The study reveals that conformant planning is equivalent to a specific type of hyperproperty model-checking, which provides new insights into problem-solving approaches in both fields.

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CubeBench, a benchmark for evaluating the spatial reasoning and cognitive challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Rubik's Cube tasks, revealing significant shortcomings in long-term planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle in real-world physical deployment due to deficiencies in spatial reasoning, state tracking, and exploration under partial observation.

Method: CubeBench employs a three-tier diagnostic framework focusing on Rubik's Cube-related tasks, which progressively test LLM capabilities in state tracking, mental simulation, and active exploration.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs show critical limitations, especially in long-horizon planning tasks, with a 0.00% pass rate on all such tasks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight significant cognitive deficits in current LLMs and suggest a framework for diagnosing these issues, aimed at improving their physical-world intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workflow agents struggle with real-world problems that require tool use, so the motivation is to create an intelligent tool-integrated agent for more autonomy and efficiency in decision-making.

Method: MindWatcher integrates interleaved thinking, multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, automated data auditing, and a dedicated evaluation pipeline, supported by a comprehensive benchmark, high-quality datasets, and an efficient training infrastructure.

Result: MindWatcher demonstrated superior tool invocation and problem-solving performance, even surpassing larger, newer models in experiments.

Conclusion: MindWatcher marks a significant advancement in agentic reasoning by achieving highly autonomous and efficient tool integration with impactful insights for future agent training methods.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

Method: The paper introduces a computationally-embedded agent model based on automata within a universal computer. It defines a novel objective, 'interactivity,' and proposes a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm to evaluate agents' continual learning capabilities.

Result: Experimental results indicate that deep linear networks sustain greater interactivity as capacity increases, whereas deep nonlinear networks exhibit struggles in maintaining continual adaptation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of the computationally-embedded perspective and interactivity metric for evaluating continual learning. It highlights that architecture choice (linear vs nonlinear) significantly impacts continual learning performance.

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent proves effective in automating and accelerating kernel development across varied AI workloads and hardware architectures, addressing scalability and performance challenges.

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Reinforcement Learning for improving Large Language Models by proposing Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), which optimizes learning from sampled responses through a novel select-then-rewrite strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning improvement relies heavily on sampling high-quality responses, but sparse or indistinguishable rewards from an initial model make learning ineffective for complex instruction-following tasks.

Method: The authors introduce HiR, a framework that uses a select-then-rewrite strategy to convert failed response attempts into successful ones in hindsight, enabling dual-preference learning with binary reward signals.

Result: HiR demonstrates promising results across various instruction-following tasks, improving sample-efficiency and reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: Hindsight instruction Replay enhances RL efficiency for instruction-following in LLMs while saving computational resources, proving its utility in constrained learning environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

*Haoyu Pei,Zhongyang Liu,Xiangyi Xiao,Xiaocong Du,Haipeng Zhang,Kunpeng Zhang,Suting Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VC investments largely fail but require synthesis of complex relational evidence for success prediction. MIRAGE-VC uses advanced methods for reasoning to improve these predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting startup success through reasoning-based synthesis of relational evidence, overcoming gaps in traditional methods and achieving interpretable insights.

Method: MIRAGE-VC employs a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework. It retrieves high-value graph paths through iterative selection and uses a multi-agent architecture to integrate heterogeneous evidence streams.

Result: MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% improvement in F1 and +16.6% in PrecisionAt5 during strict anti-leakage controls, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: MIRAGE-VC demonstrates a novel approach to off-graph reasoning by successfully predicting outcomes in the venture capital domain. Its framework can be extended to related domains like recommendations and risk assessments.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

*Alessio Benavoli,Alessandro Facchini,Marco Zaffalon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the design of AI systems that align with human values, specifically through the AI assistance and shutdown frameworks, requiring reasoning under uncertainty and managing various preference types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that AI systems align with human values, prioritize safety, and operate securely through the frameworks of AI assistance and shutdown mechanisms.

Method: The method analyzes the AI assistance, where the agent learns the human utility function, and the shutdown problem, where the AI refrains from influencing shutdown scenarios, ensuring task competence.

Result: The paper identifies the necessity for AI systems to reason under uncertainty while handling incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences to tackle alignment and safety challenges.

Conclusion: It concludes that designing aligned and safe AI requires agents capable of making decisions under complex preferences and uncertainties, contributing to the AI alignment and safety fields.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CreativeDC, a method to enhance the creativity and diversity of problem generation by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Educators face challenges from LLMs generating repetitive and homogeneous outputs, limiting diversity in educational materials and student engagement.

Method: CreativeDC employs a two-phase prompting method inspired by creativity theories, separating creative exploration from constraint satisfaction to broaden idea generation.

Result: CreativeDC demonstrates significantly higher diversity and novelty in generated problems, while maintaining their usefulness, outperforming baseline methods. Scaling further increases problem diversity as sampling expands.

Conclusion: CreativeDC successfully mitigates the limitations of LLMs, enabling broader and more diverse problem generation for educational contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents I-PERI, a federated causal discovery algorithm addressing client-level interventions, enhancing privacy and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in federated causal discovery when client-specific heterogeneity and unknown interventions exist, moving past idealized assumptions.

Method: Introduced I-PERI, which constructs CPDAGs from client data and refines them by exploiting client intervention-induced differences to achieve tighter Φ-Markov equivalence classes.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees and privacy preservation of I-PERI were established. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrated its effectiveness.

Conclusion: I-PERI effectively handles federated causal discovery with unknown client-specific interventions, offering a theoretically sound and privacy-preserving approach.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Web World Model (WWM), a system leveraging web technology to create structured, yet open-ended virtual environments for language agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing frameworks for virtual environments for language agents either lack dynamic adaptability (web frameworks) or pose controllability challenges (fully generative models). The paper aims to find a balance between consistency and flexibility.

Method: The authors propose WWMs, which use web code for defining logical rules and state structure, while employing large language models for generating context and high-level content. A suite of systems is built to showcase its applications, emphasizing code and deterministically structured exploration.

Result: The WWMs demonstrate scalability and the ability to build diverse, adaptable virtual environments by merging web frameworks with generative model capabilities. Identified principles ensure efficient design.

Conclusion: Web stacks can effectively combine reliable rule sets with open-ended language model-driven exploration, providing a scalable foundation for designing virtual worlds for language agents.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to transform analog design automation by improving reliability and efficiency while supporting reproducibility and generality.

Abstract: Analog circuit design remains a knowledge- and experience-intensive process that relies heavily on human intuition for topology generation and device parameter tuning.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications.

*Sophie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the hierarchical and cognitively-aligned structure in transformer model sentence embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether transformer-generated sentence embeddings align with higher-level human cognitive and psychological attributes in their geometric structures.

Method: The authors used a dataset with natural-language sentences annotated by cognitive scores and tier labels. They applied linear and shallow nonlinear probes to evaluate the ability of sentence embeddings to decode these annotations.

Result: The findings demonstrate that both continuous and tiered cognitive annotations can be reliably decoded from transformer embeddings. Shallow nonlinear probes outperformed linear probes. The structure in embeddings is also distinct from surface word statistics, as indicated by poor baseline performance of lexical TF-IDF models.

Conclusion: Transformer embeddings exhibit hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human cognitive attributes, providing insights into their potential for encoding high-level human-like understanding.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that transformer-based language models learn rich geometric structure in their embedding spaces, yet the presence of higher-level cognitive organization within these representations remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.

TL;DR: SmartSnap introduces a new approach to reinforcement learning by enabling agents to perform proactive self-verification, using curated snapshot evidence for task validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high cost of traditional task verification methods in reinforcement learning, which rely on analyzing verbose agent trajectories post-task completion.

Method: SmartSnap introduces the Self-Verifying Agent, which self-verifies tasks in real-time using snapshot evidence guided by the 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, Creativity). These snapshots are used for validation by a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier.

Result: SmartSnap improves scalability in RL agents, achieving performance gains of up to 26.08% and 16.66% for 8B and 30B models respectively. The method outperforms competitive benchmarks like DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: SmartSnap enhances the scalability and reliability of RL systems, establishing a paradigm for agents to autonomously verify and demonstrate task completion effectively.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

*Zubaida Mohammed Albadani,Mohammed Q. Shormani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) syntax of qulk-clauses within minimalism, proposing their biclausal structures and layered syntax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the syntax of qulk-clauses in YIA and contribute to generative syntax theories.

Method: Utilized the Minimalist Program using operations like Merge, Move, Agree, Spell-out, and Morphological Merger.

Result: Establishes qulk-clauses as biclausal, highlights dialect-specific syntactic features, and theoretical contributions in minimalism.

Conclusion: Suggests extending analysis to kil-k clauses and explores the universality of minimalism.

Abstract: This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

*Donggyun Bae,Jongil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA) for efficient fine-tuning of large language models using frequency-aware modulation, achieving competitive performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models by leveraging frequency-aware mechanisms to maintain performance while reducing the need for extensive computational resources.

Method: FAA integrates random Fourier features into adapter modules to decompose intermediate representations into low- and high-frequency components, enabling adaptive modulation of semantic information without modifying the backbone model.

Result: FAA achieves competitive or better performance compared to existing methods on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks, with reduced computational and memory demands.

Conclusion: FAA effectively utilizes frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, offering a robust and efficient solution for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, highlighting FAA as a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.

*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to enhance Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with few-shot approaches, achieving competitive results on the UCI-HAR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition methods often depend on large labeled datasets and geometric exemplar selection, struggling to differentiate similar activities such as walking variations. This paper addresses the need for semantic reasoning in selecting informative exemplars.

Method: The framework uses LLM-generated semantic priors that focus on feature importance, class confusability, and exemplar budgets, combined with structural techniques like margin-based validation, PageRank, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization for exemplar selection.

Result: The proposed method achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78% on the UCI-HAR dataset, surpassing methods like random sampling, herding, and $k$-center under few-shot settings.

Conclusion: LLM-derived semantic priors, integrated with geometric and structural cues, significantly improve the exemplar selection process in wearable sensor Human Activity Recognition.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

### [60] [Hallucination Detection and Evaluation of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22416)
*Chenggong Zhang,Haopeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM) to address hallucination detection in LLMs more efficiently, achieving reduced evaluation time and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of hallucinations in LLMs that generate misleading content and to improve current verification methods which are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper integrates HHEM, a lightweight framework independent of LLM-based judgment. It employs classification methods, segment-based retrieval, and comparative analysis.

Result: HHEM reduces evaluation time dramatically (from 8 hours to 10 minutes) while achieving high accuracy (82.2%) and TPR (78.9%). Segment-based retrieval enhances detection in summarization tasks.

Conclusion: HHEM offers efficient and accurate hallucination detection for LLM-generated content. Structured frameworks combining efficiency and robust validation are essential for improving reliability in LLM applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \(82.2\%\) and TPR \(78.9\%\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.

Motivation: To address challenges of irrelevant information retrieval and answer misalignment in open-domain settings.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline leveraging Gemini 2.5 Flash for query formulation and filtering, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation.

Result: Outperformed baselines in static evaluation; achieved significant ROUGE-L and DeBERTaScore improvements across datasets.

Conclusion: HiFi-RAG demonstrates the viability of hierarchical filtering pipelines and distinct models for cost-efficient, high-quality answer generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in open-domain settings faces significant challenges regarding irrelevant information in retrieved documents and the alignment of generated answers with user intent. We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%). On Test2025, our custom dataset evaluating questions that require post-cutoff knowledge (post January 2025), HiFi-RAG outperforms the parametric baseline by 57.4% in ROUGE-L and 14.9% in DeBERTaScore.

*Jie Zhou,Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the accounting domain, focusing on their reasoning capabilities, and finds that while GPT-4 excels, all models need optimization for real-world use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs into professional fields like accounting is crucial for digital transformation and enhancing societal development. Understanding their reasoning capacity is important for achieving these goals.

Method: The researchers developed evaluation criteria for vertical-domain accounting reasoning by analyzing training data characteristics. Using these criteria, they tested models like GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and GPT-4 with different prompt engineering strategies.

Result: GPT-4 exhibited the strongest accounting reasoning ability among tested models. However, all models displayed limitations that hinder their application in real-world, enterprise-level accounting.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in accounting-specific reasoning, significant optimization is required for effective deployment in enterprise scenarios to realize their full potential in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping learning paradigms, cognitive processes, and research methodologies across a wide range of domains. Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.

### [63] [Constituency Structure over Eojeol in Korean Treebanks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22487)
*Jungyeul Park,Chulwoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper advocates an eojeol-based constituency representation for Korean treebanks, separating morphological details into a non-constituent layer for better alignment and cross-treebank comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and mismatches in Korean constituency treebanks caused by conflating word-internal morphology with syntactic structure, and to support compatibility across treebank resources.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks under explicit normalization assumptions and proposes an eojeol-based annotation scheme that aligns constituency with dependency representations.

Result: The study demonstrates that Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks are representationally equivalent at the eojeol-based constituency level and presents an annotation scheme for improved cross-treebank operations and conversions.

Conclusion: An eojeol-based structure better represents Korean constituency, separates morphologies for clarity, ensures compatibility across resources, and provides a unified approach to syntax annotation.

Abstract: The design of Korean constituency treebanks raises a fundamental representational question concerning the choice of terminal units. Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.

### [64] [Anka: A Domain-Specific Language for Reliable LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23214)
*Saif Khalfan Saif Al Mazrouei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines and demonstrates its advantages for improving LLMs' performance on complex programming tasks by reducing ambiguity. Anka outperforms Python in multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the systematic errors observed in Large Language Models (LLMs) during complex, multi-step programming tasks. These errors arise due to the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which allows ambiguity and requires implicit state management.

Method: The authors designed and introduced Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) with constrained and explicit syntax, to reduce ambiguity in code generation. They tested Anka using benchmark problems and compared its performance with Python.

Result: Anka achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% accuracy on benchmark problems with Claude 3.5 Haiku. It outperforms Python on multi-step tasks, showing a performance gap of 40 percentage points (100% accuracy for Anka vs. 60% for Python). Cross-validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms Anka's superior performance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs can effectively learn new domain-specific languages (DSLs) through in-context learning and that DSLs with constrained syntax can reduce errors, outperforming general-purpose languages in specific complex tasks. The authors have also shared their language implementation and evaluation framework for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.

*Suhua Wang,Zifan Wang,Xiaoxin Sun,D. J. Wang,Zhanbo Liu,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Manchu Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that addresses challenges of data scarcity and phonological agglutination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in synthesizing speech for Manchu, an endangered language, characterized by extreme data scarcity and agglutinative linguistic structure.

Method: A three-tier text representation paired with a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for alignment and integration of deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer. A hierarchical contrastive loss and data augmentation are also utilized.

Result: Experiments show the proposed ManchuTTS model achieves a high MOS of 4.52 using limited data and improves pronunciation accuracy and prosodic naturalness significantly compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ManchuTTS is effective for Manchu speech synthesis, providing significant gains in quality and demonstrating the efficacy of its tailored approaches to low-resource linguistic challenges.

Abstract: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

### [66] [Learning When Not to Attend Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22562)
*Xuan Luo,Kailai Zhang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the All-or-Here Attention (AHA) mechanism for Large Language Models, enabling dynamic toggling between global and local attention, cutting computational costs without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational inefficiency in large language models arises from always attending to the global context, which often is unnecessary. The authors aim to replicate human reading strategies where attention to global context is used sparingly.

Method: The proposed AHA mechanism employs a binary router for each attention head to toggle dynamically between full global attention and a sliding local window of attention for each token.

Result: Using a local window size of 256 tokens, the AHA mechanism replaces 93% of full-attention operations with sliding window attention without incurring any performance loss. It demonstrates that attention needs decrease significantly as the window size expands.

Conclusion: AHA effectively reduces the redundancy of full attention mechanisms in LLMs, showing that accessing global context on-demand is sufficient, which improves computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: When reading books, humans focus primarily on the current page, flipping back to recap prior context only when necessary. Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

TL;DR: The paper addresses sentiment analysis in dialogues by creating methods for extracting sentiment sextuples and identifying sentiment shifts using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance multimodal sentiment analysis in conversations by extracting detailed sentiment annotations and understanding sentiment shifts.

Method: A structured prompting pipeline for Subtask-I to guide LLMs in extracting sentiment components, and an ensemble strategy of multiple LLMs in Subtask-II to detect sentiment transitions and triggers.

Result: Achieved 47.38% average score on sentiment extraction (Subtask-I) and 74.12% exact match F1 score on sentiment flipping detection (Subtask-II).

Conclusion: Step-wise refinement and LLM ensembling prove effective in handling sentiment analysis complexities in multimodal conversational contexts.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is a complex yet crucial challenge toward building emotionally intelligent AI systems. The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces T3LLM, a framework for improving reasoning in time series question answering (TSQA) tasks with corrections and fine-tuning through collaboration among three models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for handling TSQA tasks face reasoning errors due to the complex nature of numerical sequences, creating a need for mechanisms to enhance consistency and accuracy.

Method: T3LLM uses a three-model pipeline (worker, reviewer, student) where the worker generates step-wise reasoning, the reviewer identifies and corrects errors, and the student learns improved reasoning through corrective feedback.

Result: Experiments on real-world TSQA benchmarks show that T3LLM outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines in accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper highlights that T3LLM effectively addresses reasoning challenges in TSQA tasks by leveraging a correction mechanism and fine-tuning, demonstrating its potential for improving time series analysis in LLMs.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity and multilingual evaluation framework for code generation in large language models, analyzing their capabilities at Class, Function, Block, and Line levels across 18 programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code generation are limited in structural granularity and programming language diversity, which obscures detailed capability variations and cross-language performance.

Method: The authors created a framework (M2G-Eval) with 17K+ training tasks, 1,286 human-annotated test samples, and evaluated 30 models including M2G-Eval-Coder models developed using supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Three main findings: (1) Line-level tasks are easier than Class-level tasks, (2) performance gaps between programming languages grow with task complexity, (3) models exhibit strong cross-language correlations, indicating transferable programming knowledge.

Conclusion: M2G-Eval facilitates a detailed understanding of code generation performance and exposes challenges in generating complex, multilingual, and long-form code structures.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of code large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in systematically evaluating their code generation capabilities, yet existing benchmarks predominantly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios. We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

TL;DR: Diffusion models for language generation face challenges due to the structured nature of text. This paper revisits diffusion language modeling and identifies structural trade-offs and key issues, proposing directions for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language generation via diffusion models by addressing challenges posed by the structured nature of text.

Method: Analyzes diffusion models by categorizing approaches, identifying deficiencies in corruption methods and training, and proposing text-aligned diffusion processes.

Result: Highlights issues with current diffusion models: uniform corruption fails to account for positional information, and token-wise training does not capture multi-token dependencies.

Conclusion: Future diffusion language models need processes aligned more with text structure for better coherence and parallel decoding effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.

*Hadi Mohammadi,Tamas Kozak,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines methods to improve the faithfulness of Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models, focusing on GRPO and DPO optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning enhances problem-solving capabilities in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning but lacks reliability, as models can generate misleading justifications, undermining their trustworthiness.

Method: The authors evaluate two optimization techniques: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), analyzing their impact on improving CoT faithfulness metrics in LLMs of varying scales.

Result: Experiments reveal GRPO outperforms DPO in larger models, especially Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, showing positive correlation between model size and performance, although GRPO is less stable at smaller scales.

Conclusion: GRPO is a promising method for enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in CoT reasoning within large language models, despite its instability at smaller model sizes.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates width pruning in GLU-MLP layers using the MAW criterion, finding that pruning affects model capabilities selectively rather than uniformly, improving instruction-following but degrading factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the effects of GLU-MLP structured width pruning on various cognitive capabilities and to understand the selective modulation induced by the expansion ratio.

Method: The authors evaluate seven expansion ratio configurations using benchmarks that test factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. They apply MAW-guided pruning and analyze outcomes.

Result: Findings include improved instruction-following capabilities (+46% to +75%) and robust multi-step reasoning performance, alongside degraded factual knowledge and perplexity metrics. A strong inverse correlation is observed between factual knowledge and truthfulness.

Conclusion: The expansion ratio critically influences cognitive capabilities, challenging the notion of uniform degradation in pruning. MAW-guided pruning selectively preserves desired behaviors while optimizing energy efficiency in specific workloads.

Abstract: Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.

*Yoshith Roy Kotla,Varshith Roy Kotla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a method to improve the efficiency of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current predictive models exhibit poorly calibrated uncertainty quantifications, especially in high-stakes tasks, and typical methods like naive conformal prediction result in overly broad and unhelpful prediction sets.

Method: The Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP) framework combines semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce large-vocabulary prediction spaces while ensuring valid coverage.

Result: VACP achieves 89.7% empirical coverage (close to a 90% target) and reduces the average prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens in experiments on the Gemma-2B model using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks.

Conclusion: VACP effectively balances the tradeoff between coverage and efficiency in prediction, providing a practical and scalable approach to improve large language model predictions with rigorous theoretical backing.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, yet standard softmax probabilities are often poorly calibrated. We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.

*Ahmed Abdullah,Sana Fatima,Haroon Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multilingual framework for hope speech detection, focusing on low-resource languages like Urdu by using pretrained transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The underrepresentation of hope speech detection in NLP, especially in low-resource languages like Urdu, has limited the creation of tools that foster positive communication online.

Method: Pretrained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT) were utilized with simple preprocessing to train classifiers for hope speech detection.

Result: The framework achieved strong performance with F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for multi-class classification, with competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

Conclusion: This demonstrates the potential of leveraging multilingual models for hope speech detection in low-resource environments, promoting constructive digital discourse.

Abstract: Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether reasoning in large language models transfers logically across languages, revealing flaws especially in non-Latin scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if large language models' reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting are valid across different languages.

Method: Introduces a human-validated evaluation framework, analyzes 65k reasoning traces across 6 languages and models, and develops an error taxonomy through annotations.

Result: Finds that reasoning often fails to logically support conclusions, especially in non-Latin scripts, with prevalent evidential errors and illogical reasoning.

Conclusion: Current multilingual evaluation practices are insufficient and should integrate reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks for robust assessments.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

*Sashank Chapala,Maksym Mironov,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how different prompt strategies can reduce Social Desirability Bias (SDB) in LLMs when simulating population responses, finding that reformulated prompts are most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Social Desirability Bias in large language models when simulating population responses, especially for socially sensitive questions, and to improve the alignment between LLM-based silicon sampling and real human data.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs (Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini). Four prompt styles were tested: reformulated phrasing, reverse-coded prompts, priming instructions, and preamble instructions. The alignment with ANES data was measured using Jensen-Shannon Divergence and bootstrap confidence intervals.

Result: The study found that reformulated prompts were the most effective in reducing Social Desirability Bias, producing distributions closer to real human responses. Reverse-coding showed mixed results, while priming and preamble instructions did not consistently mitigate the bias.

Conclusion: Prompt-based framing can effectively mitigate Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, with reformulated prompts demonstrating the most practical benefit for more representative silicon sampling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \emph{priming} and \emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of social media data, particularly Twitter, to study negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research, employing NLP for categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant issue of infant mortality caused by birth defects and the need for better tools to understand negative pregnancy outcomes.

Method: Develop an NLP pipeline to process and categorize social media data from women sharing their pregnancy experiences based on reported outcomes.

Result: Demonstrated the potential of social media data for identifying pregnancy outcomes and assessing causal impacts of interventions on maternal and fetal health.

Conclusion: Social media data can be a useful adjunct to traditional data sources, offering new opportunities for epidemiological studies on pregnancy outcomes.

Abstract: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.

*Aiwei Liu,Minghua He,Shaoxun Zeng,Sijun Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Yuan Liu,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) aiming to improve inference speed by leveraging causal attention to enable parallel generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for faster inference in LLMs, as token-by-token generation in autoregressive decoding limits parallelism, and existing Diffusion Language Models often lack significant speed gains over optimized AR engines.

Method: WeDLM uses causal attention with a unique Topological Reordering method that maintains a strict causal mask and avoids repeated contextualization by enabling prefix-cache friendly parallel generation.

Result: WeDLM achieves substantial decoding speedups, approaching 3x in reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy scenarios compared to optimized AR engines like vLLM.

Conclusion: WeDLM demonstrates that diffusion-style decoding can outperform highly optimized autoregressive engines, combining parallelism with high-quality token generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioSelectTune, a fine-tuning framework for biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) that achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced high-quality training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the adaptation of general-domain large language models (LLMs) for BioNER by addressing challenges such as lack of domain-specific knowledge and the negative impact of low-quality training data.

Method: The paper proposes the BioSelectTune framework that reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON task and uses a Hybrid Superfiltering strategy to select high-quality training data effectively.

Result: BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BioNER benchmarks, surpasses fully-trained baselines, and outperforms specialized models like BioMedBERT while using only 50% of curated data.

Conclusion: The study highlights that prioritizing data quality enables more efficient and effective model fine-tuning, showcasing BioSelectTune as a superior framework for biomedical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) is a foundational task in medical informatics, crucial for downstream applications like drug discovery and clinical trial matching. However, adapting general-domain Large Language Models (LLMs) to this task is often hampered by their lack of domain-specific knowledge and the performance degradation caused by low-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce BioSelectTune, a highly efficient, data-centric framework for fine-tuning LLMs that prioritizes data quality over quantity. Methods and Results: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON generation task and leverages our novel Hybrid Superfiltering strategy, a weak-to-strong data curation method that uses a homologous weak model to distill a compact, high-impact training dataset. Conclusions: Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Notably, our model, trained on only 50% of the curated positive data, not only surpasses the fully-trained baseline but also outperforms powerful domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TEXT, a Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis model using explanations and temporal alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for better explanations and temporal alignments in Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis applications, especially those involving human interaction.

Method: The authors propose TEXT, which integrates Multi-modal Large Language Models for explanations, introduces a temporal alignment block for audio and video via neural networks, and employs text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion.

Result: TEXT outperforms six tested models across four datasets, reducing mean absolute error by 13.5% on one benchmark dataset compared to recent approaches.

Conclusion: Using explanations, novelty alignment methods, and text-guided modeling, TEXT demonstrates significant advancements in sentiment analysis performance.

Abstract: Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.

TL;DR: This paper examines improving Urdu fake news detection through domain adaptation of multilingual models like XLM-R and mBERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu, a low-resource language, has limited tools for misinformation detection, a common issue in today's digital age.

Method: The study employs a staged training approach that includes domain-adaptive pretraining using an Urdu news corpus before fine-tuning for fake news classification.

Result: Domain-adapted XLM-R outperformed the baseline in all cases, while domain-adapted mBERT showed mixed outcomes.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation can be effective for misinformation tasks in low-resource languages, although results vary across models.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates different methods for segmenting clinical notes by testing rule-based, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models using a dataset of 1,000 notes. GPT-5-mini showed the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes' unstructured formats make secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications challenging, necessitating improved methods to structure these notes effectively using section boundaries.

Method: The study evaluates rule-based, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models (e.g., GPT-5-mini) on clinical note segmentation with a dataset containing 1,000 MIMIC-IV notes.

Result: GPT-5-mini delivers the highest average F1 score of 72.4, outperforming lightweight baselines which show competitive performance in structured tasks but struggle with unstructured freetext.

Conclusion: Large language models offer superior performance for clinical note segmentation compared to traditional methods, supporting further advancements in downstream tasks such as summarization and information extraction.

Abstract: Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NepEMO, a dataset for emotion and sentiment classification on Nepali subreddit posts, and demonstrates the superiority of transformer models for these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a comprehensive dataset for analyzing emotions and sentiments, specifically for multilingual social media posts related to the Nepali subreddit.

Method: The authors manually curated a dataset of 4,462 Reddit posts written in English, Romanised Nepali, and Devanagari. Posts were annotated for five emotions and three sentiment classes. They analyzed emotion trends and examined co-occurrence, sentiment-specific n-grams, topic modeling (using TF-IDF and LDA), and compared various ML, DL, and transformer models.

Result: Transformer models outperformed traditional ML and DL approaches for both multi-label emotion classification and sentiment classification tasks.

Conclusion: The provided NepEMO dataset fills a niche for analyzing Nepali subreddit posts and shows the effectiveness of transformer models for sentiment and emotion analysis.

Abstract: Social media (SM) platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit) are increasingly leveraged to share opinions and emotions, specifically during challenging events, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and political elections, and joyful occasions like festivals and celebrations. Among the SM platforms, Reddit provides a unique space for its users to anonymously express their experiences and thoughts on sensitive issues such as health and daily life. In this work, we present a novel dataset, called NepEMO, for multi-label emotion (MLE) and sentiment classification (SC) on the Nepali subreddit post. We curate and build a manually annotated dataset of 4,462 posts (January 2019- June 2025) written in English, Romanised Nepali and Devanagari script for five emotions (fear, anger, sadness, joy, and depression) and three sentiment classes (positive, negative, and neutral). We perform a detailed analysis of posts to capture linguistic insights, including emotion trends, co-occurrence of emotions, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF keyword extraction. Finally, we compare various traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer models for MLE and SC tasks. The result shows that transformer models consistently outperform the ML and DL models for both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in reinforcement learning due to limited complexity, instability, and heterogeneity in simulated environments for training language-based agents.

Method: The paper proposes (1) an automated pipeline for creating scalable, difficult, verifiable simulated environments and (2) an environment-level RL algorithm addressing instability and improving advantage estimation.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on benchmarks like tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench demonstrate the methods' effectiveness and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches enhance RL training by overcoming key challenges, achieving effective performance and robust generalization in simulated environments.

Abstract: Conducting reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated environments offers a cost-effective and highly scalable way to enhance language-based agents. However, previous work has been limited to semi-automated environment synthesis or tasks lacking sufficient difficulty, offering little breadth or depth. In addition, the instability of simulated users integrated into these environments, along with the heterogeneity across simulated environments, poses further challenges for agentic RL. In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further in-depth analyses underscore its out-of-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can benefit from reshaped token-output distributions during large language model (LLM) pre-training, proposing a new method that balances diversity and precision for improved reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how adjusting the token-output distribution during pre-training can shape exploration space and improve reasoning abilities in RL-enhanced large language models.

Method: The authors derived a generalized pre-training objective using on-policy RL principles within supervised learning. This includes reward shaping to balance diversity and precision using a reward scaling factor and rank-aware mechanisms for token handling.

Result: They found that a precision-oriented token-output distribution underpins better exploration for RL compared to higher entropy distributions, leading to improved reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Reorienting pre-training objectives to focus on precision rather than entropy provides a more favorable exploration space for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

*Mengdi Chai,Ali R. Zomorrodi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluated the clinical decision-making capabilities of three LLMs through a series of case studies and examined the effects of prompt engineering on their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to evaluate whether LLMs can provide effective clinical decision support in real-world settings and understand the role of prompt engineering in enhancing performance.

Method: 36 case studies were utilized to assess the models' performance across five clinical decision-making tasks under varying temperature settings and using prompt engineering techniques.

Result: Models performed differently across tasks, with high accuracy in final diagnosis but lower accuracy in diagnostic testing. Prompt engineering improved performance in some areas but was not universally effective, showing variability depending on model and task.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that LLMs' clinical utility varies by task, and while prompt engineering can enhance certain areas, a tailored, context-aware approach is necessary for effective integration into healthcare settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

### [87] [Improving Generalization in LLM Structured Pruning via Function-Aware Neuron Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23014)
*Tao Yu,Yongqi An,Kuan Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework for LLMs that improves generalization and accuracy by grouping and pruning neurons based on their functional roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of substantial computational and storage costs of LLMs while improving generalization to downstream tasks when calibration sets inadequately reflect pretraining data.

Method: FANG identifies neurons with specific functional roles, groups them based on semantic context, prunes each group independently, and preserves neurons contributing across multiple contexts. It adaptively allocates sparsity based on functional complexity.

Result: FANG improves downstream accuracy and language modeling performance, outperforming existing pruning methods FLAP and OBC by 1.5%-8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

Conclusion: FANG is an effective pruning framework that improves LLM efficiency, provides better generalization, and achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and sparsity trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

### [88] [LENS: LLM-Enabled Narrative Synthesis for Mental Health by Aligning Multimodal Sensing with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23025)
*Wenxuan Xu,Arvind Pillai,Subigya Nepal,Amanda C Collins,Daniel M Mackin,Michael V Heinz,Tess Z Griffin,Nicholas C Jacobson,Andrew Campbell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called LENS to align multimodal sensor data with language models for generating mental health narratives, offering scalability and improved clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of translating raw multimodal health sensing data into natural language and the scarcity of paired sensor-text datasets, which hampers the usage of LLMs in mental health applications.

Method: The LENS framework processes health sensor signals by creating an extensive dataset of over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants and training a patch-level encoder to integrate time-series data directly with LLMs.

Result: LENS demonstrates superior performance in standard NLP metrics, symptom-severity accuracy, and provides clinically meaningful narratives as confirmed by a user study with 13 mental-health professionals.

Conclusion: LENS advances the use of LLMs in health sensing, offering a scalable solution for interpreting behavioral signals, and has the potential to support clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal health sensing offers rich behavioral signals for assessing mental health, yet translating these numerical time-series measurements into natural language remains challenging. Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.

### [89] [Is Chain-of-Thought Really Not Explainability? Chain-of-Thought Can Be Faithful without Hint Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23032)
*Kerem Zaman,Shashank Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Biasing Features metric, showing it confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness and proposes broader interpretability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the Biasing Features metric, which inaccurately flags CoTs as unfaithful when omitting certain hint-related details.

Method: Multi-hop reasoning experiments with models, introducing faithful@k metric, using Causal Mediation Analysis, and analyzing hint verbalization under token limits.

Result: Evidence shows CoTs flagged as unfaithful by the Biasing Features metric were faithful by other metrics. Larger token budgets enhanced hint verbalization significantly.

Conclusion: Biasing Features metric is insufficient; broader methods are needed for faithful CoT evaluation, emphasizing causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.

Abstract: Recent work, using the Biasing Features metric, labels a CoT as unfaithful if it omits a prompt-injected hint that affected the prediction. We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.

### [90] [Accelerating Language Model Workflows with Prompt Choreography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23049)
*TJ Bai,Jason Eisner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Prompt Choreography," a framework for improving the efficiency of LLM multi-agent workflows through dynamic caching and parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current workflows using large language models often face inefficiencies due to redundant computations, which increase latency and reduce scalability.

Method: They propose a dynamic global key-value (KV) cache to store previous encodings, allowing LLM calls to access prior messages' encodings in an arbitrary, reordered way. Fine-tuning adjusts the LLM to ensure caching produces results close to the original re-encoding process.

Result: Prompt Choreography reduces per-message latency by 2.0-6.2x for time-to-first-token and delivers overall workflow speedups of over 2.2x.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs for dynamic caching can significantly enhance multi-agent workflows, achieving faster execution times and reducing computational redundancy.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.

*Melikşah Türker,A. Ebrar Kızıloğlu,Onur Güngör,Susan Üsküdarlı*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabiBERT, a Turkish-specific monolingual Transformer model based on modern advancements like RoPE and FlashAttention. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on TabiBench and offers resources for reproducible research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish NLP has lacked encoder models trained from scratch that adopt modern architectural improvements seen in Transformer models. The motivation is to close this gap and introduce a strong monolingual model for Turkish NLP tasks.

Method: The authors developed TabiBERT using the ModernBERT architecture, trained on a large, diverse Turkish corpus of one trillion tokens. The model incorporates advanced techniques such as Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and supports a larger 8,192-token context.

Result: TabiBERT achieves a score of 77.58 on the TabiBench benchmark, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points. It also achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks like question answering, code retrieval, and document retrieval, as well as improving cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: TabiBERT establishes itself as a state-of-the-art Turkish NLP model, effectively addressing the gap in architecture and performance for Turkish-specific encoder research. It also emphasizes reproducibility with open resources.

Abstract: Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the major bottleneck of high computational cost in large language models and enhance their efficiency during training and inference.

Method: The paper introduces a MatMul-free LM with partially fixed/shared layer weights and reservoir layers to create dynamic representations without additional training costs while optimizing memory access operations.

Result: The proposed model reduces parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining performance similar to baseline models.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a computationally efficient strategy for large language models without compromising on performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing; however, their high computational cost remains a major bottleneck. In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the BiomedTLDR dataset of researcher-authored scientific paper summaries to address the lack of a comprehensive scientific TLDR dataset and evaluates LLMs' abilities in summary generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization abilities by addressing the absence of a high-quality scientific TLDR dataset.

Method: The authors developed BiomedTLDR, a dataset of researcher-authored summaries, and assessed open-weight LLMs' performance in generating summaries based on scientific abstracts.

Result: LLMs can generate humanoid summaries but tend to be extractive and rely on original text structure and lexicon more than humans.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in science communication but still struggle to generate human-like, abstractive TLDRs. BiomedTLDR provides a valuable resource for improving LLM summarization capabilities.

Abstract: High-quality scientific extreme summary (TLDR) facilitates effective science communication. How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/netknowledge/LLM_summarization (Lyu and Ke, 2025).

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-PeerReview, an unsupervised ensemble method for selecting optimal responses generated by multiple large language models, based on a peer-review-inspired approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the quality and adaptability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) using an unsupervised ensemble method.

Method: The approach involves scoring responses through LLM-as-a-Judge, aggregating scores using graphical models or averaging strategies, and selecting the highest-scoring response.

Result: LLM-PeerReview achieved superior results on four datasets, surpassing the performance of Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is simple yet effective, offering significant improvements while maintaining interpretability and adaptability.

Abstract: We propose LLM-PeerReview, an unsupervised LLM Ensemble method that selects the most ideal response from multiple LLM-generated candidates for each query, harnessing the collective wisdom of multiple models with diverse strengths. LLM-PeerReview is built on a novel, peer-review-inspired framework that offers a clear and interpretable mechanism, while remaining fully unsupervised for flexible adaptability and generalization. Specifically, it operates in three stages: For scoring, we use the emerging LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate each response by reusing multiple LLMs at hand; For reasoning, we can apply a principled graphical model-based truth inference algorithm or a straightforward averaging strategy to aggregate multiple scores to produce a final score for each response; Finally, the highest-scoring response is selected as the best ensemble output. LLM-PeerReview is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. The two variants of the proposed approach obtain strong results across four datasets, including outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points, respectively.

### [95] [Interpretable Safety Alignment via SAE-Constructed Low-Rank Subspace Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23260)
*Dianyun Wang,Qingsen Ma,Yuhu Shang,Zhifeng Lu,Lechen Ning,Zhenbo Xu,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features for explicit and interpretable low-rank subspace creation, which enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting large language models assume low-rank subspaces for task-relevant updates, but they lack interpretability and direct control due to polysemanticity.

Method: The authors employ pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle features and identify task-relevant elements in a feature space. Then, they construct an explicit low-rank subspace to improve adapter initialization.

Result: The method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate on safety alignment tasks, improving upon full fine-tuning by 7.4 points while updating only 0.19-0.24% parameters. It also offers interpretable insights by grounding subspaces to SAE features.

Conclusion: The proposed approach integrates mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process, leading to both improved adaptation performance and transparency for large language models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce live streams in China face false advertising issues due to hosts using morphs. This undermines trust in these sales channels, especially for health and medical products.

Method: The researchers designed a Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task and compiled a dataset with 86,790 samples. They converted the problem into a text-to-text generation task while utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data.

Result: The method improved morph resolution task performance successfully. Morph resolution significantly enhanced monitoring and regulation of e-commerce live streams.

Conclusion: LifeAMR represents an effective approach to mitigate false advertising in Chinese e-commerce live streams, aiding platform regulations through improved morph detection.

Abstract: E-commerce live streaming in China, particularly on platforms like Douyin, has become a major sales channel, but hosts often use morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising. This study introduces the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task to detect such violations. Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

TL;DR: AI4Reading is a multi-agent AI system designed to produce audiobook-style interpretations using large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technologies, addressing time and resource challenges in manual creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of audiobook interpretations is resource-intensive and time-consuming. There is a need for an automated system to simplify the process while maintaining content quality.

Method: AI4Reading employs 11 specialized agents within a framework that includes topic analysts, case analysts, editors, and narrators working collaboratively to ensure accurate, comprehensible, and logically-structured content.

Result: The system produces interpretative scripts with simpler and more accurate outputs, though it still lags in speech generation quality when compared to human experts.

Conclusion: AI4Reading demonstrates potential in automating audiobook interpretation creation, with notable advantages in script accuracy and simplification, albeit with room for improvement in speech synthesis quality.

Abstract: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.

Result: The paper offers a comprehensive framework surrounding memory in AI agents and insights into its taxonomy, storage, lifecycle management, benchmarks, and security challenges.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of leveraging insights from cognitive neuroscience to enhance AI systems, particularly memory mechanisms in LLM-driven agents, and highlights promising future directions.

Abstract: Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called SGR (Stepwise Graph-based Reasoning) to enhance reasoning accuracy in Large Language Models by using external subgraphs for dynamic and structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, while excelling in general NLP tasks, struggle with deep reasoning and logical inference, often incorporating irrelevant or noisy information. This impacts their accuracy and factual consistency.

Method: Introduces SGR, which generates query-relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases, and uses these subgraphs for guided, stepwise reasoning. This process reduces noise and improves inference quality.

Result: The proposed SGR framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multiple benchmark datasets, indicating improved reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: SGR effectively addresses the reasoning limitations of LLMs by leveraging structured external knowledge and step-by-step reasoning, enhancing their performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

*Jiapeng Wang,Yiwen Hu,Yanzipeng Gao,Haoyu Wang,Shuo Wang,Hongyu Lu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Junyi Li,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents EntroDrop, a token dropout method to mitigate performance degradation in large language models caused by repeated training on limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Repeated data exposure during multi-epoch training leads to overfitting in autoregressive models, especially causing imbalance in learning low-entropy and high-entropy tokens.

Method: The proposed EntroDrop method masks low-entropy tokens during training using an entropy-guided approach and employs a curriculum schedule to regulate dropout strength.

Result: Experiments on models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters demonstrate that EntroDrop improves performance and maintains robustness under extended multi-epoch training scenarios.

Conclusion: EntroDrop aligns token-level regularization with learning dynamics, providing an effective strategy for adapting large language models in data-limited domains.

Abstract: As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

### [101] [The Effect of Gender Diversity on Scientific Team Impact: A Team Roles Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23429)
*Yi Zhao,Yongjun Zhu,Donghun Kim,Yuzhuo Wang,Heng Zhang,Chao Lu,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how gender diversity impacts scientific team success, focusing on roles within teams. Analyzing over 130,000 papers, it identifies nuanced effects based on leadership and support roles, including size-based variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent findings on gender diversity's impact on team success and introduce role differentiation to understand its role-specific effects.

Method: The study classified authors into leadership and support roles using contribution statements and examined gender diversity's influence via multivariable regression and threshold regression models across more than 130,000 PLOS journal papers.

Result: 1) Gender diversity follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with team impact for both leadership and support roles. 2) All-female leadership paired with all-male support teams achieve higher impact. 3) Gender diversity in leadership negatively impacts small teams but has no significant effect on large teams, while support-group diversity influences positively across all sizes.

Conclusion: Gender diversity has complex and role-specific effects on scientific team impact. Leadership and support roles, team size, and gender combinations significantly influence team success, revealing critical variations obscured by aggregate diversity metrics.

Abstract: The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams.

### [102] [C2PO: Diagnosing and Disentangling Bias Shortcuts in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23430)
*Xuan Feng,Bo An,Tianlong Gu,Liang Chang,Fengrui Hao,Peipeng Yu,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a major cause of bias in LLMs as spurious feature correlations and proposes a framework (C2PO) to address both stereotypical and structural biases simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in LLMs compromises their trustworthiness. Previous approaches fail due to isolating stereotypical and structural biases, often exacerbating one while addressing the other.

Method: The authors developed Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), which uses causal counterfactual signals and dynamic fairness updates to filter bias-inducing features during optimization.

Result: C2PO was tested on benchmarks for stereotypical bias, structural bias, and general utility, showing effective bias mitigation and maintaining strong reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: C2PO offers a unified solution to biases in LLMs, proving effective against multiple benchmarking tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant risks to trustworthiness, manifesting primarily as stereotypical biases (e.g., gender or racial stereotypes) and structural biases (e.g., lexical overlap or position preferences). However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.

### [103] [ClinDEF: A Dynamic Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23440)
*Yuqi Tang,Jing Yu,Zichang Su,Kehua Feng,Zhihui Zhu,Libin Wang,Lei Liang,Qiang Zhang,Keyan Ding,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues, enabling granular evaluation of diagnostic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks inadequately represent dynamic clinical reasoning, which involves iterative doctor-patient interactions. Current methods often rely on limited datasets and lack fine-grained evaluation.

Method: ClinDEF uses a disease knowledge graph to dynamically generate patient cases and orchestrates multi-turn interactions between an LLM doctor and an automated patient agent. It also incorporates efficiency and rubric-based quality assessments.

Result: ClinDEF unveils critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, allowing for more nuanced evaluations.

Conclusion: ClinDEF contributes a robust evaluation framework that enhances understanding of LLMs’ clinical reasoning capabilities, moving beyond traditional static question-answering assessments.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

### [104] [Coupling Experts and Routers in Mixture-of-Experts via an Auxiliary Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23447)
*Ang Lv,Jin Ma,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce ERC loss to align router decisions with experts' capabilities in mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, enhancing performance and control over specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models typically have limitations due to lack of proper alignment between the router's decisions and the experts' capabilities, affecting model performance.

Method: The ERC loss is proposed—a lightweight auxiliary loss enforcing constraints on expert-router coupling using proxy tokens and internal activations. It ensures each router embedding aligns with its expert's capabilities without scaling with batch size.

Result: Pre-trained MoE-LLMs with ERC loss, from 3B to 15B parameters, showed improved performance and robust evaluation across trillions of tokens.

Conclusion: ERC loss enhances MoE model alignment and provides tracking/control over expert specialization levels during training, making it computationally efficient and insightful.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

*Thomas Haschka,Joseph Bakarji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hierarchical density clustering method using large language model embeddings is developed to classify and reveal semantic structures in text datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of uncovering hierarchical semantic structures in text corpora using LLM embeddings, which are not inherently transparent despite advancements in storage and retrieval techniques.

Method: The paper introduces a nested density clustering method that searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space, gradually relaxing density criteria to merge smaller clusters and form a hierarchical tree structure of semantic relationships.

Result: The method successfully constructs hierarchical trees for inferring relationships in scientific abstracts, as well as benchmark datasets like 20 Newsgroups and IMDB Movie Reviews, demonstrating robustness across domains.

Conclusion: The nested density clustering approach effectively reveals hierarchical semantic relationships, providing new tools for topic organization, scientometrics, and visualizing text evolution within datasets.

Abstract: Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.

*Hadar Miller,Tsvi Kuflik,Moshe Lavee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACT algorithm achieves high accuracy (F1 score: 0.91) for detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic texts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text reuse methods fail in identifying complex, short, and embedded quotations accurately.

Method: ACT consists of three stages: morphology-aware alignment, context-sensitive enrichment, and stylistic evaluations to classify citation patterns.

Result: Full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperformed other systems, achieving an F1 of 0.91. Strong results also observed in genre classification and intertextual analysis.

Conclusion: ACT bridges the gap between automatic quotation detection and human editorial standards, benefiting digital humanities and historical textual studies.

Abstract: This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as "Wave" and "Echo" quotations.
  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.
  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

*Fengjiao Chen,Minhao Jing,Weitao Lu,Yan Feng,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the unification of visual understanding and generation in large vision-language models using UniHetero, emphasizing the impact of semantics-oriented generation on understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate whether visual generation can enhance visual understanding in large-scale data settings.

Method: The authors introduce and analyze a unified model, UniHetero, which is pretrained on over 200 million samples and explores key factors like semantic generation and autoregression on input embeddings.

Result: The study finds that semantic generation, rather than pixel generation, improves understanding, demonstrates superior data scaling trends, and enhances data utilization. Additionally, autoregression on input embedding is effective for capturing visual details.

Conclusion: Generation can enhance understanding in vision-language models if focused on generating semantics, not pixels.

Abstract: Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified model with a concise structure, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details.

### [108] [Single LLM Debate, MoLaCE: Mixture of Latent Concept Experts Against Confirmation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23518)
*Hazel Kim,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models often reinforce input confirmation bias, especially harmful in multi-agent debates. This paper introduces MoLaCE, a framework addressing bias using prompt-specific activation strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the dangers posed by LLMs reinforcing input confirmation bias, particularly in scenarios such as multi-agent debates that amplify errors.

Method: Introducing MoLaCE, which adjusts latent concept activation strengths at inference-time based on varied prompt phrasing to reduce confirmation bias and improve LLM robustness.

Result: MoLaCE demonstrates notable reduction in confirmation bias, improved model robustness, and efficiency surpassing multi-agent debate techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively minimizes confirmation bias while enhancing computational scalability compared to debate methods, making it versatile for single and multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

*Sahil Kale,Antonio Luca Alfeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that uses knowledge graphs to improve hallucination detection in LLMs, showing significant improvement in performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address hallucinations in LLMs, which pose a significant challenge to their safe deployment.

Method: The method involves converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs and using these graphs to assess the likelihood of hallucinations in the responses.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score across two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This low-cost, model-agnostic method improves hallucination detection in LLMs, contributing to safer and more trustworthy language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.

*Daiki Shiono,Shumpei Miyawaki,Ryota Tanaka,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how fine-tuning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) causes a decline in their instruction-following ability, suggesting a solution to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often fail to follow task instructions after fine-tuning, raising the need to investigate and address this decline in performance.

Method: Quantitative experiments were conducted by creating specific training datasets that explicitly specify output format and analyzing how this affects instruction-following ability.

Result: Results showed that LVLMs trained with datasets emphasizing output format instructions followed instructions more accurately, while traditional datasets led to a decline in this ability.

Conclusion: Including samples with explicit output format instructions during fine-tuning can help preserve LVLMs' instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.

*Yu-Xiang Lin,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and investigates 'style amnesia' in spoken language models (SLMs), referring to their inability to maintain consistent speaking styles in multi-turn conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the limitations of spoken language models in maintaining consistent paralinguistic styles (e.g., emotion, accent, volume) over multiple conversational turns.

Method: The study evaluates three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, analyzing their performance in maintaining style instructions. It employs various prompting strategies and explores the impact of system versus user prompts on style adherence.

Result: The evaluated SLMs cannot consistently maintain instructed speaking styles throughout a conversation. While they can recall style instructions when asked, they still fail to continuously express them without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: SLMs exhibit style amnesia in multi-turn interactions, struggling to adhere to style instructions. Explicit prompting helps partially mitigate this issue, but the models still show inconsistencies, highlighting areas for improvement in their behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfTool is a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to autonomously interact with external tools using synthetic data, improving accuracy without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address three key challenges in enabling LLMs to use external tools: reliance on costly human data annotation, poor generalization to new tools, and limitations in single-model-based synthesis approaches.

Method: The proposed InfTool framework involves three self-evolving collaborative agents to generate and validate data for optimizing the model. It uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards in a closed-loop system to iteratively improve without human input.

Result: InfTool achieved a significant improvement in the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), raising a 32B model's accuracy from 19.8% to 70.9%, exceeding models 10 times larger, all with synthetic data.

Conclusion: InfTool demonstrates that self-evolving, multi-agent synthesis can greatly enhance the functionality of LLMs in interacting with external tools, eliminating the need for human annotations and outperforming larger models.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to reliably invoke external tools remains a critical bottleneck for autonomous agents. Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHQ-Summ, a domain-expert-annotated dataset for summarizing consumer health-related questions, addressing challenges in natural language understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer health questions are often overly descriptive, making natural language understanding difficult. There's a need for summarization to distill essential information, but a lack of domain-specific datasets hinders progress.

Method: The researchers created CHQ-Summ, a dataset of 1507 expert-annotated consumer health questions and their summaries. It was derived from community Q&A forums and benchmarked on multiple summarization models.

Result: CHQ-Summ was successfully benchmarked on state-of-the-art summarization models, demonstrating its usefulness for understanding health-related consumer posts.

Conclusion: The CHQ-Summ dataset fills a significant gap by providing a domain-expert resource for developing better summarization systems for consumer health information.

Abstract: The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset

TL;DR: NestBrowse introduces a browser-action framework that simplifies tools for information-seeking agents, enhancing deep-web exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable better browser-interaction capabilities for information-seeking agents, addressing limitations in API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based access.

Method: It introduces a nested structure for browser-action frameworks, decoupling control from exploration for improved agent reasoning.

Result: NestBrowse demonstrated strong performance on challenging benchmarks, enhancing efficiency and flexibility in acquiring deep-web information.

Conclusion: The framework enables more effective and simplified browser interaction, unlocking richer information for IS agents.

Abstract: Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how hidden adversarial prompts in academic papers can manipulate review outcomes by large language models (LLMs), with language-based variations in effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to assess the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes tasks, specifically academic peer review, against hidden prompt injection attacks.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of 500 peer-reviewed academic papers, introduced hidden adversarial prompts in multiple languages, and analyzed their influence on LLM-generated review scores and decisions.

Result: Prompt injections significantly altered review outcomes in English, Japanese, and Chinese, while Arabic injections showed minimal or no impact.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems for academic reviews are prone to manipulation through document-level prompt injection, with the magnitude of effect varying by language.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProfASR-Bench, a benchmark for high-stakes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in industries like finance, medicine, legal, and technology, focusing on context-awareness and entity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of dense domain-specific terminology, variation in formal speech, and critical recognition of entity errors in ASR systems within professional settings.

Method: The authors developed ProfASR-Bench, pairing natural language prompts with entity-rich utterances, enabling context-conditioned evaluation. It supports traditional ASR metrics and specialized entity-aware scores, further analyzing performance by accent, gender, and context conditions.

Result: Even with high-quality context (prompts), current ASR systems show negligible improvements in word error rate (WER). Adversarial prompts fail to degrade performance, exposing a 'context-utilization gap' in contemporary systems.

Conclusion: ProfASR-Bench sets a standard for assessing and improving ASR context usage, providing tools for detailed analysis and fusion strategies in professional talk domains.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for fine-tuning language models using structured, iterative feedback, resulting in improved preference tuning compared to other alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language model responses by providing targeted and effective fine-tuning approaches based on user preferences.

Method: The method involves annotators giving detailed feedback on specific parts of the response, allowing the model to iteratively improve its outputs based on step-by-step revisions.

Result: The approach shows better performance compared to standard A/B testing or full contrastive rewrites in aligning the model with user preferences.

Conclusion: The structured, feedback-driven revision process is a more efficient and effective way of fine-tuning language models for preference alignment.

Abstract: We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

*Jing Huang,Shujian Zhang,Lun Wang,Andrew Hard,Rajiv Mathews,John Lambert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores techniques for eliciting behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversational settings, introducing a novel analytical framework and generalized online method for behavior elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on multi-turn conversational settings for evaluating behaviors induced in large language models (LLMs) and offer a novel analytical approach for doing so.

Method: The authors present an analytical framework classifying existing elicitation methods into three categories (prior knowledge, offline interactions, online interactions) and propose a generalized online multi-turn elicitation method, unifying single and multi-turn approaches.

Result: The study notes that online methods achieve a notably higher success rate (45-77%) using relatively few queries compared to static methods from current benchmarks, which find limited success in identifying behavior-inducing inputs.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of dynamic benchmarks and demonstrates the effectiveness of their generalized online approach for identifying behaviors in multi-turn conversational scenarios.

Abstract: Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.

### [120] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper systematically characterizes motion encoding in text-to-video diffusion models by analyzing the trade-off between motion and appearance across timesteps, proposing a simplified motion customization method based on their findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand how motion and spatial appearance are encoded and disentangled in text-to-video diffusion models, particularly exploring the empirical heuristic of early motion-focused tuning versus later appearance refinement.

Method: The authors proxy motion encoding by analyzing the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation when conditions are injected at specified timesteps. Through a large-scale quantitative study, they map the competition between motion and appearance along the denoising trajectory.

Result: They identify distinct regimes in the denoising trajectory: an early phase dominated by motion and a later phase dominated by appearance. This finding allows them to simplify motion customization by focusing on the motion-dominant regime.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a clearer principle for spatiotemporal disentanglement in video diffusion models, turning an empirical heuristic into a systematic framework and improving motion transfer/editing techniques without additional complexity.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

TL;DR: VISTA is a modular framework that enhances the robustness and reasoning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by separating perception and reasoning via controlled interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end Vision-Language Models tend to exploit spurious correlations instead of causal evidence, and their reliance on shortcuts increases with fine-tuning.

Method: VISTA separates perception and reasoning using a frozen VLM sensor for short, objective queries and a text-based LLM reasoner for question decomposition, planning, and aggregating visual facts. It uses reinforcement learning to improve unbiased reasoning.

Result: VISTA significantly improves robustness, achieving +16.29% and +6.77% on SpuriVerse compared to baseline VLMs, while maintaining competitive performance on MMVP and SeedBench. It transfers well across unseen sensors and corrects perception failures.

Conclusion: VISTA enhances visual reasoning by being less biased, grounded in evidence, and robust to perception errors, outperforming traditional VLMs on realism and neutrality in reasoning traces.

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that outperforms clinical baselines in aneurysm detection, challenging assumptions about data augmentation in low-data medical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve aneurysm detection accuracy given challenges like subtle morphology, class imbalance, and limited annotated data.

Method: A dual-encoder framework (SAMM2D) was implemented and compared using varied data augmentation regimes with pretrained backbones.

Result: SAMM2D achieved AUC of 0.686 (32% improvement over baseline) and demonstrated significant savings in screening, outperforming augmented models.

Conclusion: Strong pretrained features are more effective than additional augmentation in medical imaging, emphasizing model calibration for improved clinical adoption.

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

*Xitong Ling,Minxi Ouyang,Xiaoxiao Li,Jiawen Li,Ying Chen,Yuxuan Sun,Xinrui Chen,Tian Guan,Xiaoping Liu,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HookMIL is a novel MIL framework designed for computational pathology. It balances efficient computation with retaining important context using learnable hook tokens for structured aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL approaches for WSI analysis either lose significant contextual information or suffer from computational inefficiencies when using attention layers. This paper aims to bridge that gap.

Method: This paper introduces HookMIL, which uses compact and learnable hook tokens initialized with key visual, textual, or spatial priors. These tokens leverage bidirectional attention with linear complexity and promote diverse feature specialization using Hook Diversity Loss.

Result: HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art results on four public pathology datasets, demonstrating both improved computational efficiency and better interpretability.

Conclusion: HookMIL successfully addresses the limitations of both traditional and transformer-based MIL methods, representing a significant advancement for WSI analysis in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and usability.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

### [126] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight segmentation model, Tiny-YOLOSAM, which combines the TinySAM segmentation model with YOLOv12 for faster and more practical full-scene segmentation, significantly improving accuracy and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges encountered with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) during latency-critical tasks, enabling efficient and high-quality segmentation.

Method: The proposed method combines YOLOv12 detection for generating box prompts with TinySAM segmentation. Sparse point prompts are selectively used to address regions not covered by YOLO-guided masks, reducing unnecessary computations.

Result: The Tiny-YOLOSAM approach achieves substantial improvements in segmentation coverage and quality metrics on COCO val2017 while reducing runtime dramatically, from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image, yielding a 4.7x speedup.

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting, combined with sparse sampling, offers an efficient and effective alternative to dense segment-everything prompting for practical full-scene segmentation that balances performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

*Shivum Telang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel AI method for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) using a multimodal explainability model, integrating OCT and fundus images. This model mimics an ophthalmologist's lesion analysis process and provides detailed reasoning through Grad-CAM heatmaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is frequently undiagnosed due to limited access to physicians and current AI models' lack of multidimensional and interpretable diagnostics. There is a need for an accessible, explainable model to identify lesions and aid physicians in clinical decision-making.

Method: The research introduces a multimodal explainability model employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with few-shot learning. It combines lesion identification from OCT and fundus images while leveraging Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability.

Result: The model processes a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images. It successfully highlights lesion distributions and regions contributing to DR severity classifications, achieving improved diagnostic clarity and practical applicability.

Conclusion: This model enhances the explainability and effectiveness of AI-assisted DR diagnostics by combining multimodal imaging and reasoning-based lesion localization. It holds significant potential for improving screening, treatment, and research in addressing vision loss due to DR.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCFormer, a lightweight and efficient transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters, employing weak supervision for training and achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and deployment limitations of crowd counting relying on labor-intensive annotations and computationally intensive methods, particularly for resource-constrained environments.

Method: TCFormer leverages a vision transformer as a feature extractor for efficient feature representation and incorporates a Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module for adaptive regional feature modulation. Additionally, a density-level classification loss is introduced to regularize training and improve accuracy under weak supervision.

Result: TCFormer achieves high estimation accuracy using image-level global counts, performing well on four benchmark datasets while being ultra-lightweight and efficient enough for edge device deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed TCFormer framework balances parameter efficiency and performance, presenting a promising solution for crowd counting tasks in scenarios with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

Method: A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized for automated classification of parasitized vs. uninfected blood cell images. The model is compared with established architectures and enhanced with Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps.

Result: The custom CNN achieves high classification performance, with 96% accuracy, precision, and recall exceeding 0.95 for both classes, demonstrating superior results compared to existing architectures.

Conclusion: The study showcases deep learning's potential in providing rapid, accurate, and transparent malaria diagnostics, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are energy-intensive while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency but lack robust modeling capabilities. This paper introduces Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework integrating structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics for efficient skeletal-based action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the energy inefficiency of GCNs and the modeling limitations of SNNs by creating a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches for action recognition.

Method: Signal-SGN++ incorporates 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC), Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC), and two mechanisms: Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) for adaptive attention routing and a Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch for multi-resolution temporal-frequency decomposition.

Result: Experiments on large benchmarks show Signal-SGN++ achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GCNs, surpasses SNN-based methods, and significantly reduces energy consumption.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in skeletal action recognition, bridging the gap between GCNs and SNNs while addressing structural and dynamic modeling challenges.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

### [133] [On Extending Semantic Abstraction for Efficient Search of Hidden Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22220)
*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework leveraging 2D VLM relevancy activations as abstract object representations to efficiently localize and complete 3D positions for hidden objects in scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop methods for efficient 3D localization of hidden objects to aid household robotics in finding objects that are at least partially occluded.

Method: Utilizing relevancy maps derived from 2D VLMs as abstract object representations, combined with historical data, to predict hidden objects' 3D positions in an unstructured search process.

Result: The proposed model effectively identifies the 3D locations of hidden objects on the first attempt, outperforming naive search approaches in speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic abstraction framework makes hidden object localization more efficient, providing practical benefits for household robotics to save time and labor in object-finding tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

*Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Qingpei Guo,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScaffold is a dynamic multimodal framework for continuous video understanding, improving event segmentation and aggregation while adapting to video duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing strategies for video comprehension are optimized for offline scenarios and fail to efficiently handle video streams due to fragmented or over-compressed output.

Method: VideoScaffold leverages Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES) to refine event boundaries and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC) to aggregate segments into abstractions.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in video understanding benchmarks and extends image-based MLLMs to handle streaming videos.

Conclusion: VideoScaffold effectively addresses temporal coherence issues in video streams, offering an innovative, plug-and-play framework for improving video comprehension.

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

### [135] [KAN-FPN-Stem:A KAN-Enhanced Feature Pyramid Stem for Boosting ViT-based Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22228)
*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViT) face challenges due to simplistic front-end designs like ViTPose using naive patchification. A novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture is proposed, improving feature fusion smoothing using KAN-based convolution and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the often-overlooked feature fusion mechanism in Vision Transformers' front-end, which limits performance in dense prediction tasks.

Method: Introduce a KAN-enhanced FPN stem that replaces standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with KAN-based convolution for better handling of artifacts in multi-scale fusion.

Result: Experiments on COCO dataset show up to +2.0 AP improvement over ViTPose-S baseline, confirming KAN-based layer effectiveness.

Conclusion: The performance bottleneck in Vision Transformers' front-end lies in feature fusion quality, not feature refinement. KAN operator offers a promising solution for enhanced feature fusion.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Xiaoling Xu,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MiG-DM, a model that enhances low-dose PET imaging by integrating cross-domain approaches and patient-specific meta-information for high-quality image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-dose PET imaging, such as noise, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details.

Method: The proposed MiG-DM employs a meta-information encoding module to align clinical parameters with image reconstruction and utilizes a cross-domain architecture for integrating projection-domain and image-domain processing.

Result: Experiments on public and clinical datasets show MiG-DM surpasses existing methods in image quality and physiological detail preservation.

Conclusion: MiG-DM demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing low-dose PET imaging quality through its innovative cross-domain and meta-information guided approaches.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that develops a lightweight yet high-performance CNN suitable for edge devices in smart agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices in smart agriculture requires balancing computational efficiency with recognition accuracy.

Method: A custom student model (with inverted residual blocks and dense connectivity) is trained under a ResNet18 teacher network. The training utilizes hard-label supervision, feature- and response-level distillation, and self-distillation.

Result: The student model achieves 98.56% accuracy on rice seed variety classification (only 0.09% lower than the teacher model). It reduces computational cost by 2.7 times and model size by more than 10 times compared to the ResNet18 teacher, along with superior or comparable performance to other pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances recognition efficiency and reduces computational cost without major accuracy loss, proving viable for edge devices in smart agriculture.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

*Aahan Sachdeva,Dhanvinkumar Ganeshkumar,James E. Gallagher,Tyler Treat,Edward J. Oughton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive RGB-LWIR video fusion framework to enhance object detection in varying light conditions for autonomous robotic platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detection systems struggle in low-light environments and lack comprehensive sensory information, which is critical for emergency robotic missions.

Method: An adaptive framework was designed to fuse RGB and LWIR video streams, utilizing 33 YOLO models trained on 22,000 images across three illumination levels, with fusion ratios ranging from 100% RGB to 100% LWIR.

Result: The fused models significantly outperformed conventional YOLO baselines under various light conditions, demonstrating enhanced detection confidence and reliability, especially in dim and full-light environments.

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improves detection across diverse lighting conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic capabilities for emergency and disaster zone missions.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

*Antara Titikhsha,Om Kulkarni,Dharun Muthaiah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances text-to-image diffusion models by introducing external geometric guidance signals, enabling better separation of geometry and style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the semantic gap between human perception and generative models, which struggle with geometric consistency under conflicting style prompts.

Method: The authors propose using an HPE teacher trained on the THINGS dataset for geometric understanding and incorporating its gradients into the latent diffusion process.

Result: The method demonstrates improved geometric control across different architectures and an 80% improvement in semantic alignment over baselines.

Conclusion: Small teacher models can guide large generative systems effectively, enabling creative and controlled text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

TL;DR: GeCo is a metric designed to detect geometric and occlusion inconsistency artifacts in static scenes by fusing motion and depth priors, offering visual consistency insights and aiding video generation improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of effective metrics for detecting artifacts like geometric deformation and occlusion inconsistency in static video scenes.

Method: The proposed method involves GeCo, which fuses residual motion cues with depth priors to generate dense consistency maps that identify artifact locations.

Result: GeCo successfully benchmarks video generation models, exposing failure modes, and can be used as a loss function without extra training, enhancing artifact reduction during video creation.

Conclusion: GeCo offers interpretable artifact detection and improves video generation robustness, providing actionable insights for addressing common video artifact issues.

Abstract: We introduce GeCo, a geometry-grounded metric for jointly detecting geometric deformation and occlusion-inconsistency artifacts in static scenes. By fusing residual motion and depth priors, GeCo produces interpretable, dense consistency maps that reveal these artifacts. We use GeCo to systematically benchmark recent video generation models, uncovering common failure modes, and further employ it as a training-free guidance loss to reduce deformation artifacts during video generation.

*Dingyu Wang,Zimu Yuan,Jiajun Liu,Shanggui Liu,Nan Zhou,Tianxing Xu,Di Huang,Dong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark to evaluate AI models in clinical reasoning, identifying limitations in their multimodal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of robust evaluation frameworks that realistically assess AI's clinical reasoning abilities in real-world patient care, moving beyond narrow exam-based benchmarks.

Method: The researchers created the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark comprising 1,245 questions based on real-world orthopedic cases, assessing 7 tasks like text/image interpretation and diagnosis. They tested 11 VLMs and 6 LLMs against expert standards.

Result: While current models perform well in structured tasks (e.g., multiple-choice), their accuracy drops significantly in open-ended, multimodal tasks. VLMs showed deficiencies in medical image analysis and frequently contradicted visual evidence due to text-driven hallucinations.

Conclusion: AI models need further development in multimodal reasoning before they can be deployed for complex clinical applications. For now, they are best suited for supportive, text-based roles.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract introduces Fetal-Gauge, a benchmark to assess Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) capabilities in fetal ultrasound tasks, identified as critical for prenatal healthcare. Current models show substantial performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the global shortage of trained sonographers and inefficient prenatal ultrasound interpretation through Vision-Language Models.

Method: The paper develops and evaluates Fetal-Gauge, a rigorous visual question answering benchmark with over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs.

Result: The analysis reveals poor VLM performance in fetal ultrasound tasks, with the best model achieving only 55% accuracy, indicating a significant gap in reaching clinical standards.

Conclusion: Fetal-Gauge highlights the limitations of current VLMs and lays the foundation for future advancements in using multimodal deep learning for accessible prenatal care.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

The framework further strengthens cross modal alignment through three components: precise text to 3D retrieval, multi view 3D to image alignment, and image to text alignment for generating temporally consistent 4D assets. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni4D achieves high quality 3D retrieval and controllable 4D generation, advancing dynamic multimodal understanding and practical applications.

Motivation: To address limitations in current methods for maintaining motion accuracy and consistency in dynamic scenes.

Method: Proposes SirenPose, a novel loss function with sinusoidal network properties and physics-based constraints for keypoint coherence.

Result: SirenPose significantly improves spatial and temporal consistency, excelling in fast motion and complex scene management.

Conclusion: This approach enhances 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes, ensuring robust motion modeling and dataset-augmented learning.

Abstract: We propose SirenPose, a novel loss function that combines the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with geometric priors derived from keypoint structures to improve the accuracy of dynamic 3D scene reconstruction. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal consistency in fast moving and multi target scenes. By introducing physics inspired constraint mechanisms, SirenPose enforces coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further expand the training dataset to 600,000 annotated instances to support robust learning. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SirenPose achieve significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency metrics compared to prior methods, showing superior performance in handling rapid motion and complex scene changes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes two modern vision-language models, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and their application in a video-to-artifact pipeline for body language detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how architecture-led analysis of VLMs can inform practical implementation in tasks like video-to-artifact pipelines, focusing on system constraints and evaluation planning.

Method: The study reviews the architectures of two VLMs and their roles in a system that samples video frames, detects people, generates bounding boxes, and validates output using predefined schemas. It focuses on foundational components like visual tokenization and instruction-following.

Result: The analysis identifies key properties of the models and system constraints, such as the importance of schema validation and the limitations of frame-local person identifiers. These insights emphasize distinctions needed for system robustness and evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that understanding architectural and behavioral distinctions in VLMs is essential for defensible claims, interface design, and evaluation in video-to-artifact pipelines.

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create a real-time, low-cost, and efficient DMS that recognizes distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors to improve in-cabin safety.

Method: It employs a compact vision model, confounder-aware labels to minimize false positives, and a temporal decision head that only triggers alerts for confident, sustained predictions.

Result: The system recognizes 17 driver behaviors and achieves 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 and 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, delivering real-time performance within hardware constraints.

Conclusion: This system demonstrates that real-time, cost-effective DMS can enhance in-cabin safety and also contribute to human-centered vehicle intelligence initiatives.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Result: The detector achieves near-perfect ranking against attacks, low calibration error, reliable abstention, and strong performance under adverse conditions, tested on various deepfake datasets and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed detector establishes a comprehensive, modular, and data-efficient baseline for practical deepfake and image forensic detection with actionable and calibrated outcomes.

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PortionNet improves food nutrition estimation accuracy using RGB images by learning 3D geometry from point clouds during training, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D information loss in food nutrition estimation using only single RGB images, and avoid reliance on specialized hardware like depth sensors.

Method: PortionNet employs a dual-mode training framework, using cross-modal knowledge distillation to learn from point cloud inputs during training. At inference, it uses lightweight adaptations requiring only RGB images.

Result: PortionNet achieved state-of-the-art results in food volume and energy estimation on the MetaFood3D dataset and demonstrated strong generalization on the SimpleFood45 dataset.

Conclusion: PortionNet enables accurate and generalizable food nutrition estimation with pseudo-3D reasoning using standard RGB images, bypassing the need for hardware like depth sensors.

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation. Cross-dataset evaluation on SimpleFood45 further demonstrates strong generalization in energy estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoFu, a framework for generating videos with natural scale and fidelity from textual prompts and reference images by addressing challenges of scale inconsistency and permutation sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues in multi-subject video generation, such as inconsistent subject scaling and distortion caused by input order sensitivity.

Method: MoFu uses Scale-Aware Modulation for consistent sizing, Fourier Fusion for unified feature representation, and a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to optimize both aspects. A new benchmark evaluates these aspects systematically.

Result: Experiments show MoFu surpasses existing methods in maintaining scale consistency, fidelity of subjects, and visual quality.

Conclusion: MoFu proves effective in addressing critical challenges in multi-subject video generation, ensuring better fidelity and visual outcomes while introducing a benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

*Yang Ding,Yizhen Zhang,Xin Lai,Ruihang Chu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoZoomer introduces dynamic visual focus for MLLMs to address long video understanding challenges via a novel temporal zooming mechanism and two-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in vision-language tasks but struggle with long video comprehension due to context limitations and reliance on static frame pre-selection methods.

Method: A framework enabling dynamic control of visual focus by starting with low-frame-rate overviews and zooming into high-frame-rate clips at chosen moments. Training includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show the model demonstrates strong reasoning ability in long video tasks, surpassing open-source models and rivaling proprietary systems efficiently.

Conclusion: VideoZoomer’s dynamic focus approach improves video reasoning efficiency and performance, showcasing emergent capabilities on complex tasks with limited frame budgets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

*Zhibin Qin,Zhenxiong Tan,Zeqing Wang,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpotEdit, a novel framework for diffusion-based image editing, which focuses on updating only modified regions instead of uniformly processing all image areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize image editing by addressing the inefficiency of current methods that unnecessarily regenerate unchanged regions, potentially degrading them and increasing computation costs.

Method: SpotEdit is training-free and relies on two components: SpotSelector to identify unchanged regions and reuse conditional features, and SpotFusion to blend features dynamically to ensure coherence and quality.

Result: SpotEdit demonstrates efficient and precise image editing by reducing redundant computations and maintaining the fidelity of unmodified areas.

Conclusion: SpotEdit offers a promising and efficient approach to image editing by selectively focusing on modified areas, improving both computational efficiency and output quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

### [152] [DeMoGen: Towards Decompositional Human Motion Generation with Energy-Based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22324)
*Jianrong Zhang,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeMoGen, a framework for motion decomposition using an energy-based diffusion model, enabling understanding and generation of complex human motions by decomposing them into simpler primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of decomposing human motions into semantically meaningful components rather than just composing them, enabling better understanding and flexible motion generation.

Method: DeMoGen employs an energy-based diffusion model with three training variants (DeMoGen-Exp, DeMoGen-OSS, and DeMoGen-SC) to uncover motion primitives and ensure semantic consistency.

Result: DeMoGen successfully disentangles reusable motion primitives, enables recombination for novel, diverse motion generation, and extends resources for compositional training through a text-decomposed dataset.

Conclusion: DeMoGen provides insights into human motion decomposition, offering practical applications in motion synthesis and extending datasets for enhanced generative modeling.

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

### [153] [The Multi-View Paradigm Shift in MRI Radiomics: Predicting MGMT Methylation in Glioblastoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22331)
*Mariya Miteva,Maria Nisheva-Pavlova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work develops a deep learning framework using variational autoencoders (VAE) to identify tumor properties by integrating MRI data, specifically for glioblastoma (GBM) diagnosis and its molecular features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting molecular characteristics of tumors from imaging suffer from feature redundancy and inadequate modeling of specific imaging data modalities. This is particularly challenging yet important for glioblastoma cases involving MGMT promoter methylation, which holds clinical significance.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-view latent representation learning approach using variational autoencoders (VAE) to combine radiomic features from two MRI modalities (T1Gd and FLAIR), while preserving modality-specific information and incorporating them into a shared latent space. This compact latent representation is then used for classification purposes.

Result: The model achieves effective integration of multi-modal MRI data while preserving the distinct information from individual modalities. This advance in integrating and utilizing MRI data shows promise for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that multi-view latent representation learning using VAEs is a feasible and efficient method to enhance tumor molecular characterization via non-invasive medical imaging, particularly for glioblastoma cases.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

*Olaide N. Oyelade,Oliver Hoxey,Yulia Humrye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end vision transformer (ViT)-based pipeline for HER2 scoring using H&E and IHC WSIs, providing pixel-level annotations with high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accuracy and offer pixel-level localization for HER2 protein expression scoring using H&E and IHC images, addressing shortcomings in existing methods.

Method: The study proposes a vision transformer pipeline that processes H&E WSIs for tumor localization, maps malignant regions on IHC WSIs, and embeds a clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism for pixel-level annotation.

Result: The model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 for HER2 scoring, showcasing effective tumor localization and joint analysis of H&E and IHC images.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the feasibility of end-to-end ViT-based models for HER2 scoring, delivering results comparable to human pathologists and advancing automated cancer analysis.

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

*Alaa Alahmadi,Mohamed Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique to enhance explainability and data efficiency in deep neural networks for ECG interpretation, particularly in the context of identifying drug-induced long QT syndrome.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low data efficiency and interpretability of machine vision models, especially in their application to ECG interpretation, limit their clinical reliability. This study aims to address these challenges by testing a pseudo-colouring technique inspired by human perception.

Method: The researchers applied pseudo-colouring to encode temporal ECG features and used prototypical networks and ResNet-18 for one-shot and few-shot learning. They evaluated model performance using ECG images capturing single cardiac cycles or full 10-second rhythms.

Result: The pseudo-colouring method improved both explainability and model performance despite limited training data. It redirected attention to clinically meaningful ECG features, suppressed irrelevant components, and achieved better generalisation.

Conclusion: Human-like perceptual encoding is shown to enhance both data efficiency and explainability in medical machine learning, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and AI predictions.

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel in 2D vision-language tasks but struggle in 3D scene manipulation. There is a need to bridge this gap to make MLLMs more effective for 3D object arrangement.

Method: The authors introduce an MCP-based API for robust function-level updates, add specialized visual tools for enhanced scene understanding, and propose a collaborative multi-agent framework for iterative task management.

Result: The proposed method is evaluated on 25 complex 3D object arrangement tasks, showing significant performance improvement over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study shows that enhanced scene understanding, function-level API changes, and a collaborative multi-agent framework can significantly benefit 3D scene manipulation using MLLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

TL;DR: This paper presents Self-E, a self-evaluating approach for text-to-image generation, offering efficient, high-quality results across both few-step and many-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a novel text-to-image generation model that unifies and enhances the benefits of traditional models (diffusion, flow, distillation) while allowing efficient generation from scratch without reliance on external teachers or extensive local supervision.

Method: The method involves a Self-E learning framework that combines Flow Matching-like data training with a self-evaluation mechanism. This enables the model to dynamically act as its own teacher and achieve global matching with fewer inference steps.

Result: The results demonstrate Self-E's excellence in few-step generation and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in 50-step scenarios. Its effectiveness improves consistently with increasing inference steps.

Conclusion: Self-E introduces a breakthrough unified framework for text-to-image generation that supports any inference step, making it efficient, scalable, and adaptable for ultra-fast or high-quality generation.

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date sidewalk data is essential for building accessible and inclusive pedestrian infrastructure, yet current approaches to data collection are often costly, fragmented, and difficult to scale. We introduce iOSPointMapper, a mobile application that enables real-time, privacy-conscious sidewalk mapping on the ground, using recent-generation iPhones and iPads. The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and localize sidewalk-relevant features such as traffic signs, traffic lights and poles. To ensure transparency and improve data quality, iOSPointMapper incorporates a user-guided annotation interface for validating system outputs before submission. Collected data is anonymized and transmitted to the Transportation Data Exchange Initiative (TDEI), where it integrates seamlessly with broader multimodal transportation datasets. Detailed evaluations of the system's feature detection and spatial mapping performance reveal the application's potential for enhanced pedestrian mapping.

TL;DR: DeFloMat is a novel generative object detection framework that significantly improves inference speed while maintaining high detection accuracy, designed specifically to address the limitations of diffusion-based methods like DiffusionDet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the inefficiency and impracticality of diffusion-based object detection models, such as DiffusionDet, in time-sensitive applications like Crohn's Disease detection via Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).

Method: DeFloMat employs Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to replace the multi-step stochastic denoising process of diffusion models with a direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport theory, enabling faster inference with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver.

Result: DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy of 43.32% (AP10:50) in just 3 inference steps, a 1.4x improvement over DiffusionDet, while also enhancing stability and recall in clinical applications.

Conclusion: DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in generative object detection, emerging as an optimal solution for stable, rapid object localization in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

TL;DR: Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter model, enables robust 3D segmentation of cellular structures directly from brightfield microscopy without fluorescence or extensive post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust volumetric segmentation in 3D brightfield microscopy to visualize cellular morphology without relying on fluorescence or heavy post-processing.

Method: Bright-4B employs Native Sparse Attention for contextual understanding, depth-width residual HyperConnections for stable representation, a soft Mixture-of-Experts to optimize capacity, and anisotropic patch embedding for geometry-faithful 3D tokenization.

Result: The model produces accurate segmentations of subcellular structures, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines, and preserves fine structural details across datasets and cell types.

Conclusion: Bright-4B advances label-free 3D cell mapping and will be openly available, enabling improvements in volumetric segmentation and cellular imaging.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FluenceFormer is a new transformer-based framework for fluence map prediction that outperforms prior convolutional methods in radiotherapy planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and physical realizability of fluence maps in automated radiotherapy by overcoming limitations of existing convolutional methods that struggle with complex relationships and long-range dependencies.

Method: A two-stage geometry-aware transformer framework is introduced. Stage 1 predicts a global dose prior, while Stage 2 refines predictions based on explicit beam geometry. A physics-informed loss function is used to ensure fidelity and structural consistency.

Result: FluenceFormer, especially when used with Swin UNETR, achieves improved results compared to CNN methods, reducing energy error to 4.5% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed FluenceFormer framework demonstrates strong potential for better fluence map prediction in radiotherapy, providing more accurate and consistent results than existing methods.

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmoCtrl for generating images faithful to content descriptions while expressing target emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models lack emotional awareness, while emotion-driven models compromise content consistency.

Method: EmoCtrl leverages a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, using textual and visual modules for emotion enhancement.

Result: EmoCtrl outperforms existing methods in balancing content fidelity and emotional expression, supported by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: EmoCtrl demonstrates robustness, adaptability, and preference alignment in generating emotionally expressive and content-faithful images.

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of fixed vertical beam resolution and environmental occlusions in LiDAR-based perception for autonomous systems.

Method: The method involves the creation of SuperiorGAT, which models LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and employs gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement to reconstruct missing elevation information with computational efficiency.

Result: SuperiorGAT demonstrates lower reconstruction errors, better geometric consistency, and minimal vertical distortion in diverse environments of KITTI data, outperforming PointNet models and deeper GAT baselines.

Conclusion: This study concludes that SuperiorGAT provides an efficient way to enhance LiDAR resolution through architectural advancements, reducing the reliance on additional hardware.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new line-based method for calibrating event cameras, which detects lines in event streams and optimizes camera parameters through a novel event-line model and optimization process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and manual requirements of existing event camera calibration methods, making them suitable for rapidly changing, real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework leverages geometric lines in man-made environments, detects lines directly from event streams, uses an event-line calibration model for initial camera parameters, and refines the parameters through non-linear optimization.

Result: Experiments on both simulations and real-world setups (monocular and stereo event cameras) demonstrate the method's feasibility and accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach reduces time consumption, eliminates manual calibration objects, and proves effective for real-world scenarios. The source code is made publicly available for further application.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

### [165] [Towards Robust Optical-SAR Object Detection under Missing Modalities: A Dynamic Quality-Aware Fusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22447)
*Zhicheng Zhao,Yuancheng Xu,Andong Lu,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust method, QDFNet, for improving optical-SAR fusion-based object detection under challenging conditions, such as missing or corrupted modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to advance fusion-based object detection in remote sensing due to its reliance on complementary optical-SAR data, which is often degraded or unavailable in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces two novel modules: Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) for quality assessment and Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) for reliable fusion, leveraging learnable tokens and orthogonal constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets (SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0) validate QDFNet's robustness and superior performance in scenarios with modality corruption or missing data.

Conclusion: QDFNet successfully addresses key limitations in optical-SAR object detection with adaptive and quality-aware fusion, ensuring consistent performance improvements even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

*Md Abu Obaida Zishan,Annajiat Alim Rasel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SonoVision, a smartphone app for the visually impaired that uses sound cues to help locate objects, enhancing independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assist visually impaired individuals to locate everyday objects independently using a smartphone application.

Method: Utilizes a Flutter-based app integrated with the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection, combined with sinusoidal sound cues in earphones to indicate object positions.

Result: The app enables visually impaired users to locate objects using audio feedback, improving autonomy and reducing dependency.

Conclusion: SonoVision is a safe, offline, user-friendly tool aimed at empowering visually challenged individuals by providing efficient object location capabilities.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PGR$^2$M, a method that uses pose-guided residual refinement to improve text-based 3D motion generation and editing capabilities compared to previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing frameworks like CoMo that struggle with capturing fine-grained temporal dynamics and high-frequency motion details, which degrade reconstruction and controllability.

Method: PGR$^2$M utilizes a hybrid approach combining pose codes and residual codes through residual vector quantization (RVQ). It employs a novel pose-guided RVQ tokenizer and Transformers for both generation and refinement tasks.

Result: The method achieves improved Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for motion generation and editing tasks. User studies also validate its capacity for intuitive structure-preserving edits.

Conclusion: PGR$^2$M provides a significant improvement in motion fidelity, controllability, and semantic alignment over existing solutions, making advancements in 3D motion synthesis and editing.

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSON, a multimodal dataset designed to address issues in learning socially compliant navigation behaviors by offering structured reasoning and balanced action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social navigation models struggle with the lack of reasoning supervision and imbalanced action distributions, hindering their ability to perform safely and interpret human-like decisions.

Method: MUSON features a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation (perception, prediction, reasoning, action, explanation) and explicitly models static constraints with a refined, balanced action space.

Result: MUSON outperforms existing datasets (e.g., SNEI) by providing consistent reasoning and action annotations. State-of-the-art models achieve a decision accuracy of 0.8625 on MUSON.

Conclusion: MUSON is a robust and reusable benchmark for improving socially compliant navigation and enabling better modeling of dynamic pedestrian interactions and constraints.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical substations are critical but vulnerable parts of the grid. Identifying their components is essential to quantify vulnerability and prevent failures, but traditional methods are inefficient.

Method: Three computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) were trained and evaluated on a labeled dataset of US substation images for accuracy, precision, and efficiency.

Result: The strengths and limitations of each model were outlined, with comparisons identifying the most reliable model for large-scale autonomous mapping.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of machine learning models to map and analyze substation components, aiding in infrastructure protection and risk mitigation.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in measuring fast-moving shock waves, which include uneven propagation and unstable testing conditions.

Method: A polar coordinate system is utilized to encode events, adaptive region-of-interest is extracted, shock wave fronts are identified through slope analysis, and 3D reconstruction models are applied.

Result: The method achieves accurate measurement with errors as low as 0.06%, compared to pressure sensors and empirical formulas.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances the precision in measuring shock wave motion, showcasing its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage semi-supervised paradigm for infrared small object detection, addressing challenges like annotation costs and domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of annotation and limitations in existing methods for infrared small object detection drive the need for a semi-supervised approach.

Method: The authors introduce a Hierarchical MoE Adapter with neural operators, applying a two-stage paradigm: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation using the adapter to create an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM), and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer using pseudo labels for lightweight models.

Result: Experiments show the proposed paradigm achieves or surpasses the performance of fully supervised models, even with minimal annotations.

Conclusion: This approach effectively addresses data scarcity in infrared small object detection and is the first to use SAM as a teacher model in a semi-supervised setting.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a video representation learning method that captures dynamic 3-D scene consistency through a self-supervised framework.

Method: The method encodes video frames into Gaussian splats moving over time, imposing an inductive bias for video as projections of dynamic 3-D scenes. This approach allows tracking to naturally emerge during network pretraining.

Result: The approach delivers zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. With fine-tuning, it improves performance by 34.6% on Kinetics and 13.1% on Kubric datasets.

Conclusion: Using Gaussian-based encodings of videos enables significant advances in self-supervised video representation learning and tracking capabilities, validated via notable performance improvements on major benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Motivation: The need for precise detection of small and irregular objects on lunar surfaces for autonomous navigation and operation.

Method: SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter, Contrastive Alignment Module, Camera Auxiliary Training Branch, and Section-aware Coordinate Attention mechanism into the BEVFusion framework.

Result: Achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on nuScenes validation set and 90.93% mAP in simulated lunar environments, significantly outperforms the baseline.

Conclusion: SCAFusion, with minimal added computational cost, enhances object detection crucial for lunar exploration tasks.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration.

Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DreamOmni3, a unified approach for scribble-based generation and editing tasks, utilizing a combination of text, images, and sketches for creative flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-prompt-based generation and editing models often fail to address users' intended edit locations and detailed visual nuances, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: DreamOmni3 employs a novel data synthesis pipeline for seven distinct scribble-based tasks, alongside an innovative joint input mechanism that incorporates scribbled source images and simplifies processing with color-coding and shared encodings.

Result: DreamOmni3 establishes benchmarks for scribble-based editing and generation tasks and demonstrates outstanding experimental performance, promising practical applications.

Conclusion: DreamOmni3 bridges the gap in creative flexibility by enabling precise, user-intended edits while incorporating multimodal inputs; the models and code will be publicly available for advancing research.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: The paper presents CoAgent, a framework for coherent video generation by addressing coherence, visual consistency, and narrative flow challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models struggle with maintaining identity coherence, scene consistency, and temporal structure, leading to issues like identity drift and unstable structures in open-domain video generation.

Method: The proposed CoAgent framework includes a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline, with components like Storyboard Planner, Global Context Manager, Synthesis Module, Verifier Agent, and pacing-aware editor to improve narrative and visual consistency.

Result: CoAgent is shown to significantly enhance coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation through extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully tackles central challenges in video generation by improving entity-level memory, temporal rhythm, and vision-language reasoning.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SR-MCR, a framework enhancing reasoning robustness in multimodal large language models by integrating reliability cues and stabilizing training via novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs often struggle with unreliable reasoning, weak coherence, and inadequate visual grounding due to limited supervision focusing only on final answers.

Method: SR-MCR employs self-referential cues for reasoning alignment and introduces a critic-free GRPO objective with confidence-aware cooling for stable training.

Result: SR-MCR achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparably sized open-source models, attaining an average accuracy of 81.4% in visual benchmarks.

Conclusion: SR-MCR provides fine-grained, process-level guidance, significantly improving reasoning coherence and accuracy in multimodal LLMs, with validated contributions from its methodology.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas are highly aggressive cancers with complex diagnostic challenges including high imaging variability and inefficient segmentation/classification methods.

Method: The study introduces ReFRM3D, a radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network built on a 3D U-Net. It employs multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and extended residual skip mechanisms. Segmented regions are used to extract radiomics-based features for classification.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior segmentation performance on BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets with high Dice Similarity Coefficients for glioma components like whole tumor, enhancing tumor, and tumor core.

Conclusion: ReFRM3D significantly enhances glioma segmentation and classification efficiency, marking a step forward in brain tumor diagnostic techniques.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

*Marwan Taher,Ignacio Alzugaray,Kirill Mazur,Xin Kong,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces KV-Tracker, a method that enables real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and reconstruction of objects and scenes using monocular RGB videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view 3D geometry networks are too slow for real-time applications like pose tracking and scene reconstruction, necessitating a faster approach.

Method: The method involves using $π^3$ for keyframe mapping with bidirectional attention, caching key-value (KV) pairs of global self-attention blocks, and relying on this data for online tracking without need for retraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a speedup of up to 15× with high performance, achieving frame rates of ~27 FPS on datasets such as TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic, and OnePose.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker offers a model-agnostic solution for real-time multi-view 3D tasks, enabling fast and accurate tracking without drift or forgetting.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

*Bin Wang,Yang Xu,Huan Zhao,Hao Zhang,Zixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'PTalker', a framework enhancing personalized 3D talking head animations through style disentanglement and improved lip-synchronization using multi-modal alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture individual speaking styles effectively in speech-driven 3D talking head animations, limiting personalization and realism.

Method: PTalker uses style disentanglement from audio and motion sequences alongside a three-level alignment mechanism: spatial alignment via Graph Attention Networks, temporal alignment via cross-attention, and feature alignment using contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate PTalker's ability to generate realistic and stylized talking heads with improved accuracy in lip-synchronization and adaptation to individual speaking styles.

Conclusion: PTalker represents a significant advancement in lifelike, personalized 3D talking head animation, outperforming current approaches in synchronization accuracy and style representation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [181] [Enhancing Noise Resilience in Face Clustering via Sparse Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22612)
*Dafeng Zhang,Yongqi Song,Shizhuo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in face clustering using embeddings, proposing a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT) to improve similarity measurement and clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face clustering performance is hindered by ineffective similarity measurements and noisy data introduced by traditional methods like vanilla Transformers.

Method: The authors propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient and develop SDT—a Transformer-based model designed to minimize noise and emphasize relevant relationships.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MS-Celeb-1M show that the proposed method improves clustering reliability and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed Sparse Differential Transformer proves effective in enhancing clustering accuracy and robustness while addressing key challenges with traditional methods.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Motivation: Autoregressive Vision-Language Models face limitations in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic tasks due to sequential generation. This research aims to overcome these constraints using diffusion-based approaches.

Method: The study integrates diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) into Vision-Language Models (Dream-VL) and Vision-Language-Action models (Dream-VLA), employing continuous pre-training and parallel generation capabilities.

Result: Dream-VL achieves competitive and superior performance in visual planning benchmarks. Dream-VLA demonstrates high success rates in robotic control tasks, surpassing leading models like π_0 and GR00T-N1.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based backbones show significant advantages for visual planning and robotic control tasks, encouraging use in diverse applications. Dream-VL and Dream-VLA are open models available for community research.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

*Mohamad Alansari,Muzammal Naseer,Hasan Al Marzouqi,Naoufel Werghi,Sajid Javed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses memory design in SAM-based visual object tracking systems and proposes a unified framework to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore memory mechanisms in SAM-based object tracking and understand memory limitations and their application in new models like SAM3.

Method: The study analyzes SAM2 trackers, implements memory mechanisms in SAM3, and evaluates through benchmarks. A unified hybrid memory framework is proposed, distinguishing short-term and long-term memory.

Result: The proposed hybrid memory framework improves robustness in challenging scenarios for both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Conclusion: A modular and principled hybrid memory framework is effective for enhancing object tracking, with improved performance under occlusion and complex scenarios.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Envision, a diffusion-based framework to improve visual planning for embodied agents by addressing challenges in spatial drift and goal misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance visual planning for embodied agents, addressing the limitations of current forward predictive approaches which suffer from spatial drift and goal misalignment.

Method: The proposed method involves a two-stage framework: a Goal Imagery Model to synthesize goal images and an Env-Goal Video Model to interpolate trajectories from the start to the goal state using video diffusion.

Result: Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks show Envision outperforms baselines in goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation.

Conclusion: Envision provides superior visual planning capabilities, offering reliable guidance for robotic tasks via enhanced goal alignment and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) to enhance Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks using reinforcement learning with human feedback. A Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning strategy ensures stable training and suppresses reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models in capturing fine-grained distortions for ISR tasks, which can lead to reward hacking and misalignments in optimization objectives.

Method: The paper proposes FinPercep-RM for generating fine-grained perceptual degradation maps and introduces the FGR-30k dataset to train this model. It further combines this with a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning mechanism to stabilize ISR model training progressively.

Result: The model effectively mitigates reward hacking and improves both global perceptual quality and local realism in ISR tasks across reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: FinPercep-RM with the proposed learning strategy achieves superior results by improving quality assessments and stabilizing training, showing promise for broader ISR applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning models for estimating left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from echocardiogram videos, with 3D Inception models yielding the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual estimation of LVEF from echocardiograms is time-intensive and prone to variability, motivating deep learning approaches to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Various deep learning architectures, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models, were trained and evaluated using systematic modifications and fusion strategies on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset.

Result: Modified 3D Inception models achieved the best performance, with an RMSE of 6.79%, while smaller models showed better generalization and performance dependent on hyperparameter configurations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight 3D Inception architectures as effective for LVEF estimation and suggest training insights for broader medical video analysis applications.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Result: CLAdapter demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 10 datasets from diverse scientific domains including medical, industrial, and agricultural, among others.

Conclusion: CLAdapter has successfully adapted pre-trained models for data-limited scientific applications, bridging the gap between large-scale pre-trained data and task-specific requirements.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges.

Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of semantic alignment and prompt fidelity in recent text-to-image diffusion models, which often fail with complex prompts despite high visual quality.

Method: The paper introduces CritiFusion, comprising CritiCore for semantic feedback using vision-language and large language models, and SpecFusion for improving fine-grained detail through spectral domain refinement. It functions as a plug-in refinement stage without requiring additional training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CritiFusion improves human-aligned metrics, human preference scores, and aesthetic evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art text-to-image correspondence and visual quality.

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively enhances detail, realism, and prompt fidelity in text-to-image generation without requiring extra model training, making it a powerful plug-in tool for diffusion frameworks.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method called autoregressive flow matching (ARFM) for predicting complex motions over long horizons, showing improvements in human and robot motion predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion prediction models either operate on narrow distributions or fail to model complex motions despite advancements in video prediction scaling.

Method: The authors introduce ARFM, a probabilistic model, which uses autoregressive flow matching to predict continuous sequential data over long horizons and benchmarks it using diverse video datasets.

Result: The ARFM model effectively predicts complex human and robot motions, significantly improving the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ARFM offers a scalable approach to probabilistic motion prediction, enhancing both human and robot motion tracking and downstream task outcomes. Code and models are available for public use.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

*Salvador Rodriguez-Sanz,Monica Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal image registration method leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to overcome current challenges in registration accuracy, deformation complexity, and modality reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing nonrigid registration algorithms, such as their reliance on intensity correlation, performance degradation on unseen modalities, and trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity.

Method: Proposes an instance-specific method using Neural ODEs, integrating structural descriptors for modality-agnostic metrics, and variants of local mutual information and feature-based models to enhance registration performance.

Result: Achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results on various datasets, demonstrating robustness to explicit regularization, good performance on large/small deformations, multi-scale registration suitability, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural ODE-based method is robust, accurate, efficient, and extends the application of multimodal registration beyond current state-of-the-art capabilities.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

*Paul Dobre,Jackson Cooper,Xin Wang,Hongzhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCPainter, a framework combining 3D Gaussian Splat representations and diffusion-based generation for novel view synthesis (NVS) and realistic 3D asset insertion in driving simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide robust autonomous driving models with diverse, realistic training data, including long-tail driving scenarios, a unified framework for 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis is necessary.

Method: SCPainter integrates 3D Gaussian Splat representations and 3D scene point clouds, using a diffusion model to jointly achieve realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS.

Result: The framework was evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset and demonstrated the ability to generate diverse, high-quality driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The SCPainter approach successfully combines NVS and realistic 3D asset insertion, enhancing autonomous driving simulation for robust model training.

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) significantly improves cystic hygroma detection in first-trimester ultrasound images compared to the DenseNet-169 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting cystic hygroma, a high-risk prenatal condition, using automated methods due to the limitations of small labelled datasets in supervised deep learning.

Method: The authors used USF-MAE, a self-supervised pretrained model on 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, fine-tuning it for binary classification of normal and cystic hygroma cases. Model evaluation was done using the same dataset, preprocessing, and cross-validation protocol as a DenseNet-169 baseline.

Result: USF-MAE achieved superior performance with a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98, compared to the DenseNet-169 baseline (accuracy: 0.93, sensitivity: 0.92, specificity: 0.94, ROC-AUC: 0.94). Improvements were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Conclusion: USF-MAE improves the robustness and accuracy of cystic hygroma detection in early pregnancy, demonstrating potential for scalable prenatal ultrasound screening.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

*Yongzhen Hu,Yihui Yang,Haotong Lin,Yifan Wang,Junting Dong,Yifu Deng,Xinyu Zhu,Fan Jia,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Freetime FeatureGS, a novel method for 4D scene reconstruction that eliminates reliance on unstable video segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability of video-based segmentation in current 4D scene reconstruction methods, which affects the reliability of results.

Method: Freetime FeatureGS uses Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion to represent dynamic scenes. It incorporates a contrastive loss and a strategy for temporally ordered feature propagation.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in 4D scene reconstruction quality compared to recent methods.

Conclusion: Freetime FeatureGS is a more robust and accurate method for reconstructing decomposed 4D scenes, overcoming instability issues of previous approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Bo Huang,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive method for visual token pruning in Large Multimodal Models, focusing on scenarios with long contexts and multiple images. It reduces redundancy by leveraging intra-image and inter-image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing visual token pruning methods when dealing with long context and multi-image scenarios.

Method: Adaptive pruning method using intra-image diversity and inter-image variation for dynamic budget allocation, which involves content-aware token selection and Pareto selection for balancing diversity and text alignment.

Result: The adaptive pruning method achieves strong performance in handling long context scenarios while substantially reducing the number of visual tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in maintaining performance while optimizing token usage, addressing challenges in complex long context multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs face challenges in maintaining computational efficiency due to redundant token representations. Prior attempts at token reduction often ignore spatial continuity and local neighbor relationships.

Method: The paper introduces Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation, utilizing Hilbert curve reordering to preserve neighbor structures.

Conclusion: Emphasizing spatial continuity and neighbor relationships can optimize ViTs, offering new architectural insights for improving their efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

TL;DR: This study introduces an active learning algorithm using Fisher Information to optimize view selection, addressing semantics and dynamics for embodied agents. It outperforms random and heuristic methods in improving semantic segmentation and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve embodied agents' performance in tasks involving semantic and dynamic understanding by addressing data redundancy problems through smarter frame selection.

Method: The paper proposes an active learning algorithm leveraging Fisher Information to measure the informativeness of frames for both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks.

Result: Results show that the proposed method consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets.

Conclusion: Using an active learning strategy with Fisher Information provides a systematic and effective approach to selecting informative views for better scene understanding and dynamic modeling.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

*Zhicheng Liao,Baoliang Chen,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved quality grading model for AGIQA that addresses semantic inconsistencies in previous methods, resulting in better performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGIQA models exhibit semantic drift due to inconsistencies between text and image embedding correlations, leading to challenges in reliable quality assessment.

Method: The authors introduce an Arithmetic Graded Response Model (AGQG) which uses a two-branch module: one to estimate image quality abilities and another to construct difficulty levels in a controlled manner, achieving unimodal quality distributions.

Result: The proposed module enhances performance across various AGIQA frameworks and generalizes well for natural and screen content image quality assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed AGQG module effectively addresses semantic drift, demonstrates plug-and-play capabilities, and holds promise for advancing future IQA frameworks.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EPD-Solver, an accelerated ODE solver for diffusion models that addresses high sampling latency and quality issues by leveraging parallel gradient evaluations and advanced optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative performance but face challenges with high sampling latency and image quality degradation under lower latency due to accumulated truncation errors in existing solvers.

Method: The proposed EPD-Solver incorporates parallel gradient evaluations and leverages the Mean Value Theorem to approximate integral solutions accurately. It includes a two-stage optimization framework with initial parameter distillation and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning within the low-dimensional solver space. The solver also supports plugin functionality to improve existing ODE solvers.

Result: EPD-Solver demonstrates improved sampling quality and efficiency in diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks, while maintaining low latency through parallel computation.

Conclusion: EPD-Solver mitigates truncation errors and improves generative performance without compromising latency, offering a practical and flexible solution for accelerating diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods are prone to failures due to limitations in local search, especially under conditions like occlusions, viewpoint changes, and rapid movements.

Method: The authors propose VPTracker, which employs global tracking using MLLMs with a location-aware visual prompting mechanism to incorporate spatial priors, enabling region-level recognition and minimizing distractions.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant improvements in tracking stability and disambiguation in challenging scenarios, confirmed through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VPTracker successfully leverages MLLMs for robust, global vision-language tracking with enhanced stability and target identification, and the method bridges an important gap in the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of medical images is a key technology in medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis, providing structural visualization support for disease assessment and surgical planning. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

Motivation: Understand how open-vocabulary object detection models handle real-world low-quality image scenarios.

Method: Dataset creation simulating low-quality images and testing model performance under various degradation levels.

Result: Models like OWLv2 showed better resilience, while others like OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic struggled with high image degradation.

Conclusion: Open-vocabulary detection models vary in robustness; further development needed for handling extreme image conditions.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EgoReAct, an autoregressive framework for generating 3D-aligned human reaction motions based on egocentric video input. It develops the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing datasets like ViMo, which suffer from spatial inconsistency, and to develop a method that can produce realistic, spatially consistent, and causal reaction motions from egocentric video input.

Method: The authors construct the HRD dataset and propose EgoReAct. EgoReAct uses a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder for motion compression and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for generating reaction motions. The framework integrates 3D dynamic features, including metric depth and head dynamics, for enhanced spatial grounding.

Result: EgoReAct achieves higher realism, better spatial consistency, and improved generation efficiency compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining causality.

Conclusion: The paper proposes an innovative solution for modeling human reactions to egocentric video, addressing both data and methodological challenges. The researchers plan to release their code, models, and data for future development.

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DA360 sets a new benchmark for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation by addressing key challenges through architectural innovations and providing significant improvements.

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

*Chenyu Li,Danfeng Hong,Bing Zhang,Zhaojie Pan,Jocelyn Chanussot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), an interpretable approach to single-image super-resolution (SR), addressing nonlinearity, physical interactions, and uncertainties in degradation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SR methods using deep networks fail to capture and control degradation processes due to reliance on latent black-box modeling.

Method: Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, KANO employs B-spline functions to model spectral curves, optimizing shape parameters to capture key nonlinear features with transparency.

Result: KANO improves interpretability and accuracy in SR tasks by effectively modeling complex degradation mechanisms. Theoretical and experimental comparisons with MLPs validate its capabilities and limitations across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: KANO offers a structured, interpretable framework for SR, enhancing physical representation of degradation processes and potentially improving future SR techniques.

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

*Zirui Zhou,Junfeng Ni,Shujie Zhang,Yixin Chen,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCaR-3D, a framework for accurate 3D scene change detection, addressing issues of spatial inconsistency and state separation in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D change detection methods struggle with spatial inconsistencies and difficulty in separating pre- and post-change states, highlighting the need for improvement in these areas.

Method: SCaR-3D employs a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module, multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, and a continual scene reconstruction strategy to handle 3D change detection effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SCaR-3D achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, thanks to its robust framework.

Conclusion: SCaR-3D, supported by the CCS3D dataset, provides a reliable solution for 3D change detection, enhancing scene monitoring and reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

### [208] [A Minimal Solver for Relative Pose Estimation with Unknown Focal Length from Two Affine Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22833)
*Zhenbao Yu,Shirong Ye,Ronghe Jin,Shunkun Liang,Zibin Liu,Huiyun Zhang,Banglei Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for estimating relative pose and focal length with reduced degrees of freedom (DOF) using affine correspondences and vertical direction information from an IMU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an improved method to estimate relative pose and focal length in scenarios with unknown focal lengths, especially in applications like autonomous vehicles and smartphones, where IMUs provide vertical direction information.

Method: The authors derive constraint equations based on affine correspondences with a known vertical direction, reducing the problem to two parameters (focal length and relative rotation angle). They solve these using a polynomial eigenvalue method.

Result: Their method outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in both synthetic and real-world datasets for estimating relative pose and focal length.

Conclusion: The proposed solver effectively uses affine correspondences and IMU-provided vertical direction to deliver superior estimations of relative pose and focal length compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ByteLoom, a framework to overcome limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation by ensuring geometric consistency and reducing reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of existing HOI video generation methods, including poor cross-view consistency and the heavy reliance on detailed hand mesh annotations to address occlusions.

Method: The authors propose ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework utilizing Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) to ensure multi-view geometric consistency and precise 6-DoF object transformation. The training approach includes a curriculum design to enhance model capability and reduce hand mesh annotation dependency.

Result: ByteLoom shows improvements in preserving human identity, maintaining object's multi-view geometry consistency, and generating smooth motion and manipulation in HOI videos.

Conclusion: ByteLoom effectively addresses major limitations in HOI video generation, providing a robust and geometrically consistent solution with simplified human conditioning and reduced hand mesh annotation reliance.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lamps is a model pre-trained on chest radiographs using human anatomy perspectives, achieving robust and transferable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods fail to leverage anatomical consistency, coherence, and hierarchy in medical imaging, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Lamps utilizes these anatomical properties (consistency, coherence, hierarchy) as supervision signals for SSL on chest radiographs.

Result: Lamps demonstrated superior robustness, transferability, and clinical relevance across 10 datasets compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Lamps introduces a novel approach for medical imaging foundation models, aligning representations with human anatomy's structure.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

*Weiwei Li,Junzhuo Liu,Yuanyuan Ren,Yuchen Zheng,Yahao Liu,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-oriented pipeline to mitigate spurious correlations in deep learning models by identifying, neutralizing, and transforming spurious features, resulting in significantly improved worst-group accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often learn spurious correlations that are irrelevant to the task, leading to suboptimal generalization and biased predictions in real-world data.

Method: The proposed method identifies spurious features using their dispersed distribution in the feature space, neutralizes them via a grouping strategy, learns a feature transformation to eliminate them, and updates the classifier with this transformation for debiasing.

Result: Experiments show more than a 20% improvement in the worst-group accuracy compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively mitigates spurious correlations, achieving substantial gains in model fairness and robustness against biased features.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

*Ju-Hsuan Weng,Jia-Wei Liao,Cheng-Fu Chou,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses the shortcomings of concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models, introducing a multimodal evaluation framework (M-ErasureBench) and a novel module (IRECE) to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the risks of harmful or copyrighted content generation by these models, especially beyond text-prompt-based methods, by covering other critical input modalities.

Method: The paper develops M-ErasureBench for evaluating concept erasure across text, learned embeddings, and inverted latents; and introduces IRECE to enhance robustness through targeted concept localization and latent perturbation during denoising.

Result: Existing methods perform well on text prompts but fail significantly on embeddings and latents. IRECE improves robustness, reducing Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) by up to 40% in challenging scenarios while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench fills a gap in comprehensive testing for concept erasure across modalities, and IRECE offers a robust solution to safeguard generative models effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

*Hasan Faraz Khan,Noor Fatima,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal approach for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation combining visual and linguistic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation models lack semantic understanding and flexibility to adapt to user-defined objectives or new domains.

Method: SwinTF3D uses a transformer-based visual encoder and a compact text encoder, integrating them via an efficient fusion mechanism to understand natural-language prompts for segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset show SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SwinTF3D bridges visual perception with linguistic understanding, enabling adaptive, interpretable, and efficient text-driven 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

*Haosen Li,Wenshuo Chen,Shaofeng Liang,Lei Wang,Haozhe Jia,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a novel iterative refinement method for diffusion models that enhances performance by maintaining path stability on the data manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative refinement methods are promising for controlling diffusion models but are limited by the instability caused by Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which moves the sampling path off the data manifold.

Method: The authors propose GPS, which replaces CFG's extrapolation with manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring sampling path stability. They also introduce a dynamic guidance scheduling strategy aligned with coarse-to-fine generation.

Result: Experiments show GPS outperforms existing methods on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT, achieving higher perceptual quality measures and better prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Path stability is crucial for iterative refinement, and GPS offers a principled and robust framework to maintain it, demonstrating significant improvements in diffusion models' performance.

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pruning method for hash grid features in implicit neural fields for Gaussian splatting, improving storage efficiency and reducing bitrate without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The irregular and non-uniform 3D distribution of Gaussian splats causes significant storage and transmission inefficiencies due to redundant and invalid hash grid features.

Method: A hash grid feature pruning technique is proposed, which identifies and removes invalid features based on Gaussian splat input coordinates to optimize storage and transmission requirements.

Result: The approach achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline under Common Test Conditions (CTC) while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method effectively improves rate-distortion performance and reduces storage size without compromising the quality or accuracy of the model.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ColaVLA, a VLM-based framework for autonomous driving that addresses challenges in continuous control, latency, and causality for efficient and safe trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires generating safe, reliable trajectories from multimodal inputs. Existing approaches, either modular pipelines or end-to-end systems, face inefficiencies or lack interpretability. The motivation is to leverage VLMs for better generalization and reasoning in control tasks.

Method: ColaVLA is a framework combining a Cognitive Latent Reasoner that compresses scene understanding and a Hierarchical Parallel Planner that generates trajectories in one forward pass. These components ensure efficient reasoning and real-time trajectory generation.

Result: ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations, demonstrating efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.

Conclusion: ColaVLA resolves VLM-based planner challenges, achieving a balance of generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and safety in trajectory planning for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

TL;DR: DRMNet is proposed to detect tiny dense object clusters in high-resolution imagery using innovative methods like density-based spatial priors and local-global feature interaction, achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny, densely clustered objects in high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing methods fail to adapt computational focus toward these dense regions.

Method: DRMNet utilizes density maps as spatial priors through a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to guide the network, Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) for targeted feature interaction, and Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM) to refine multi-scale features using discrete cosine transform.

Result: DRMNet achieves superior detection performance, particularly in scenarios with dense object distribution and occlusion, as verified on AI-TOD and DTOD datasets.

Conclusion: DRMNet effectively addresses density concentration, computational inefficiencies, and feature degradation in detecting dense clusters of tiny objects, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing imagery analysis.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional object detectors face issues with class imbalance and label noise, motivating the need for a new approach that enhances closed-set detection performance.

Method: The method uses a lightweight parallel head to project features into CLIP embedding space, aligns them with class-specific text embeddings via contrastive loss, and applies this through joint training to various detection architectures.

Result: CLIP-Joint-Detect shows consistent and significant improvements in object detection on datasets like Pascal VOC and MS COCO while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with vision-language embeddings improves object detection performance across various architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Motivation: Increasing the perception capability of 4D mmWave radar for autonomous vehicles and robots, which is currently limited by its sparsity and lack of semantic richness.

Method: The method involves designing WRCFormer, which uses a Wavelet Attention Module for enhancing sparse radar signals, a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and a Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion mechanism to integrate radar and camera data sources efficiently.

Result: WRCFormer outperformed current methods on K-Radar benchmarks with a 2.4% improvement overall and 1.6% improvement in challenging sleet scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently addresses radar signal sparsity and semantic limitations by fusing radar and camera data, offering robust perception capabilities in various weather conditions.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

### [221] [YOLO-IOD: Towards Real Time Incremental Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22973)
*Shizhou Zhang,Xueqiang Lv,Yinghui Xing,Qirui Wu,Di Xu,Chen Zhao,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOLO-IOD, a real-time incremental object detection (IOD) framework based on YOLO-World, addressing catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve the limitations of real-time YOLO frameworks in incremental object detection and tackle catastrophic forgetting issues including foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation.

Method: YOLO-IOD utilizes a stage-wise fine-tuning process including three components: Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), Importance-based Kernel Selection (IKS), and Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD).

Result: Experiments on standard and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD outperforms existing methods, with reduced forgetting and enhanced detection performance.

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD effectively facilitates incremental learning in real-time YOLO frameworks, bridging the gap in IOD while ensuring efficient performance with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

*Chunyuan Chen,Yunuo Cai,Shujuan Li,Weiyun Liang,Bin Wang,Jing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReamCamo, an advanced framework for generating more realistic camouflaged images by addressing issues of semantic coherence and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged image generation methods lack adequate visual similarity and semantic consistency, impacting the quality of training data for camouflaged object detection.

Method: The framework introduces layout controls, multi-modal textual-visual conditions, and a novel metric to enhance the semantic relationship and camouflage quality between objects and backgrounds.

Result: ReamCamo generates realistic camouflaged images with improved semantic coherence and visual fidelity, verified via new camouflage quality metrics.

Conclusion: ReamCamo improves the realism and effectiveness of camouflaged image generation, benefiting tasks like camouflaged object detection through better training data.

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

*Huiming Yang,Linglin Liao,Fei Ding,Sibo Wang,Zijian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PoseStreamer, a framework for robust 6DoF pose estimation under high-speed and low-light conditions using event cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with high-speed moving objects due to motion blur in RGB cameras and suboptimal performance in event-camera contexts.

Method: PoseStreamer combines an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue for temporal consistency, Object-centric 2D Tracker for boosting 3D center recall, and Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement, along with a new dataset called MoCapCube6D.

Result: PoseStreamer outperforms existing solutions in accuracy for high-speed objects and generalizes well for unseen, moving objects.

Conclusion: PoseStreamer addresses key challenges in 6DoF pose estimation under challenging circumstances, proving effective and generalizable in benchmarking scenarios with high-speed motion.

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, SSA, addressing limitations in text-guided medical image segmentation by strengthening multimodal associations and introducing spatial constraints, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bottlenecks in current text-guided medical image segmentation methods, particularly their struggle with handling diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously and inability to capture positional constraints effectively.

Method: The proposed method, Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA), uses a symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to enhance associations between image regions and text. It also introduces composite directional guidance to incorporate spatial constraints using region-level masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SSA outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in segmentation of lesions characterized by spatial relations and constraints.

Conclusion: The SSA framework effectively enhances text-guided medical image segmentation, establishing stronger multimodal correspondences and spatial guidance, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel reverse personalization framework for face anonymization that achieves effective identity removal while preserving facial attributes and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing text-to-image diffusion models in removing or modifying identity-specific features, which either depend on pre-trained model representation or require excessive fine-tuning for personalization.

Method: The approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion for manipulating images without text prompts and incorporates an identity-guided conditioning branch to generalize beyond pre-trained identity data.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality for face anonymization.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a controllable and effective framework for anonymizing facial images, advancing over prior methods with improved flexibility, precision, and applicability.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

*Wenyuan Huang,Zhao Wang,Zhou Wei,Ting Huang,Fang Zhao,Jian Yang,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenGround introduces a zero-shot framework enhancing cognition-based reasoning for open-world 3D visual grounding and demonstrates competitive performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding methods are limited by reliance on pre-defined Object Lookup Tables, restricting flexibility in undefined or unforeseen target scenarios.

Method: OpenGround uses an Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module to dynamically augment Visual Language Models' cognition scope via human-like perception and reasoning, alongside a cognitive task chain.

Result: OpenGround achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer, competitive results on Nr3D, and a 17.6% improvement on the OpenTarget dataset containing over 7000 object-description pairs.

Conclusion: OpenGround effectively addresses limitations of traditional 3D visual grounding approaches and performs robustly in open-world scenarios by leveraging dynamic reasoning and expanded object cognition.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

### [228] [With Great Context Comes Great Prediction Power: Classifying Objects via Geo-Semantic Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23024)
*Ciprian Constantinescu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper emphasizes the importance of contextual information in object recognition and introduces a novel framework called Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG), leading to significantly improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional object recognition systems that ignore the important spatial, material, and co-occurrence context information in images.

Method: The authors create a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from monocular images, integrating depth estimation with unified panoptic and material segmentation. The graph captures objects and their relationships and uses a specialized graph-based classifier to incorporate object-specific, neighboring, and global scene features.

Result: Their context-aware model significantly outperforms existing methods. It achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, compared to 38.4% for context-agnostic models and 53.5% for fine-tuned ResNet, as well as outperforming a multimodal LLM that achieved 42.3%.

Conclusion: Explicitly using structured and interpretable contextual information substantially enhances object recognition performance, proving superior to state-of-the-art systems on COCO 2017 datasets.

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Co2S, a semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework designed to address pseudo-label drift using vision-language and self-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to alleviate the challenges of exhaustive annotation in remote sensing image segmentation and address issues like pseudo-label drift and error accumulation.

Method: A dual-student architecture using pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 models is proposed, employing an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism and a global-local feature fusion strategy for improved segmentation.

Result: Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Co2S across different scenarios and data partition protocols.

Conclusion: Co2S enhances semantic consistency and segmentation precision, outperforming existing methods in semi-supervised remote sensing segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework (LAM3C) that leverages unlabeled videos for 3D representation learning without using actual 3D sensors, outperforming prior methods in indoor segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting 3D scene scans is costly and labor-intensive, motivating exploration of alternative data sources like unlabeled videos for 3D representation learning.

Method: The authors introduce LAM3C, which uses video-generated point clouds derived from web-sourced room walkthrough videos (RoomTours dataset) and employs a noise-regularized loss for geometric and feature stability.

Result: LAM3C surpasses previous self-supervised 3D learning methods in indoor semantic and instance segmentation tasks despite not relying on real 3D scans.

Conclusion: Unlabeled videos are a promising and abundant resource for advancing 3D self-supervised learning effectively and affordably.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-BrowseComp, a benchmark for testing models' ability to perform agentic video reasoning by actively interrogating video timelines and cross-referencing with external web evidence, revealing a significant challenge for current AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks largely focus on static perception of curated video clips without requiring dynamic video timeline exploration, leaving a gap in evaluating open-ended, web-integrated video reasoning.

Method: The authors present Video-BrowseComp, a benchmark comprising 210 questions designed to assess an agent's ability to reason over video timelines while verifying information across the open web.

Result: State-of-the-art models such as GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) show poor performance, achieving only 15.24% accuracy, indicating their heavy reliance on text-based metadata and struggles in environments requiring detailed visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp advances video research benchmarks by shifting the focus from passive perception to active reasoning over dynamic video, highlighting current models' limitations and pushing for tools better suited to this challenge.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

*Brayden Miao,Zain Rehman,Xin Miao,Siming Liu,Jianjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a segmentation-guided chest X-ray (CXR) classification model using MedSAM for lung region extraction and evaluates its effect on multi-label abnormality detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automated CXR interpretation due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision, and to improve robustness and interpretability by integrating anatomical priors.

Method: A segmentation-guided pipeline is proposed where MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public dataset. It extracts lung regions for training and evaluating a deep convolutional network for multi-label abnormality classification.

Result: MedSAM effectively produces accurate lung masks across imaging conditions. Masking approaches (tight, loose) show a trade-off: loose masking enhances normal case detection while maintaining good abnormality classification, whereas tight masking improves training efficiency but reduces abnormality detection.

Conclusion: Lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior tailored to the backbone model and clinical objectives, rather than a universal solution for CXR classification.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

*Jian Wang,Sixing Rong,Jiarui Xing,Yuling Xu,Weide Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathoSyn is a framework for generating synthetic MRI images with high anatomical fidelity and realism, reformulating pathology as structured deviations on an anatomical base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current generative models (like global pixel domain focus or binary masks) that suffer from feature entanglement, leading to anatomical distortions or structural discontinuities.

Method: PathoSyn employs a two-step synthesis process: deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling using a novel Deviation-Space Diffusion Model with added seam-aware fusion and stabilization techniques.

Result: It outperforms existing methods (like holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned approaches) in perceptual realism and anatomical accuracy on tumor imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: PathoSyn is a mathematically robust framework enabling patient-specific synthetic MRI datasets for low-data regimes, supporting diagnostic algorithm development, disease progression modeling, and intervention planning.

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

### [234] [Domain-Shift Immunity in Deep Deformable Registration via Local Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23142)
*Mingzhen Shao,Sarang Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discovers that domain-shift resistance in deep deformable registration arises inherently due to reliance on local features rather than global appearance, presenting a novel universal framework called UniReg that achieves robustness even across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the assumed domain sensitivity of learning-based deformable image registration models, challenging the belief that large, diverse datasets are always necessary for robustness and explaining the mechanism behind inherent domain-shift immunity.

Method: The authors introduce UniReg, a model decoupling feature extraction and deformation estimation via fixed pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. It isolates domain-robust mechanisms in registration.

Result: UniReg, trained on a single dataset, achieves robust performance across domains, rivaling optimization-based methods in cross-domain and multi-modal registrational tasks.

Conclusion: Learning-based deformable registration gains robustness from reliance on local features that remain consistent across domains. The study advocates designs preserving domain-invariant local features, reshaping approaches to domain robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

*Jingyu Li,Xiaolong Zhao,Zhe Liu,Wenxiao Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoTeacher, a method aimed at improving semi-supervised 3D object detection by addressing gaps in sensitivity to geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semi-supervised 3D object detectors struggle with capturing object geometries due to the use of limited labeled data, which affects performance.

Method: The authors propose GeoTeacher, which includes a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module to enhance the student model's understanding of object geometry and a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy with a distance-decay mechanism to improve the diversity of geometric structures.

Result: Experiments on ONCE and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of GeoTeacher, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: GeoTeacher improves geometric understanding in student models under semi-supervised settings and can boost the performance of other semi-supervised 3D detection methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

*Fulin Shi,Wenyi Xiao,Bin Chen,Liang Din,Leilei Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEALER is a framework for fine-grained evaluation of text-to-image model alignments, emphasizing semantic element localization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fine-grained interpretability and human preference alignment in evaluating image-text correspondence, addressing the limitations of coarse-grained metrics and static QA pipelines.

Method: REVEALER adopts a 'grounding-reasoning-conclusion' approach with reinforcement-guided optimization (GRPO), enabling structured multimodal reasoning and element-level alignment evaluation.

Result: The proposed method outperformed proprietary models and supervised baselines in alignment tasks across four benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: REVEALER enhances the reliability of evaluating text-to-image models by enabling interpretable, fine-grained alignment judgments and efficient inference.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

*Yi Zhang,Yi Wang,Lei Yao,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework for improving 3D object detection using only RGB images by synergizing Gaussian and voxel representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based 3D detection aims to eliminate dependency on expensive depth sensors required by traditional methods using point clouds, providing a less resource-intensive alternative.

Method: The framework incorporates a dual-representation architecture that leverages continuous Gaussian modeling for fine surface details and discrete voxel structures for spatial geometry, combined via learnable cross-representation mechanisms.

Result: GVSynergy-Det outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging image-based indoor detection benchmarks like ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes without relying on dense 3D supervision.

Conclusion: The study presents a new strategy for leveraging complementary geometric information from Gaussian and voxel models, offering a significant improvement in image-based 3D detection accuracy without the need for depth or explicit geometry supervision.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified Driving World Model framework utilizing 3D Gaussian scene representation for enhanced scene understanding, multimodal generation capabilities, and textual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Driving World Models lack 3D scene understanding and fail to align textual information effectively with spatial data, limiting interpretability and reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces a framework using 3D Gaussian scene representation to align textual information early and employs a task-aware language-guided sampling strategy to refine 3D tokens. It also integrates dual-condition multimodal generation combining high-level language and low-level image conditions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance validated by studies on the nuScenes and NuInteract datasets.

Conclusion: The framework significantly advances 3D scene understanding and multimodal generation capabilities for Driving World Models, with plans for open-source code release.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forest mapping methodologies face accuracy limitations, prompting the integration of DL models and OBIA to enhance precision.

Method: Deep learning models (UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, ResNet50-Segnet) are implemented on Sentinel-2 imagery alongside OBIA techniques for mapping efficacy.

Conclusion: The method showcases improved forest mapping accuracy and the utility of accessible tools like QGIS, promoting environmental conservation efforts.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

*Jongoh Jeong,Youngjin Oh,Gyeongrae Nam,Jeongeun Lee,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of military target detection across diverse environments using cost-effective RGB-image data and synthetic datasets created with Unreal Engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithms for domain adaptive object detection focus on natural scenarios but fail to address the unique challenges of military domains with diverse and mixed environments.

Method: The authors propose generating photorealistic synthetic RGB data using Unreal Engine and conducting experiments to transfer knowledge from synthetic data to real-world military target datasets.

Result: The experiments reveal that domain adaptation methods with minimal supervision achieve better performance compared to unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: Despite advancements with minimal supervision in domain adaptation, challenges remain in fully optimizing military target detection for diverse, cross-domain tasks.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

*Changgyoon Oh,Jongoh Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving diffusion models for few-shot dense prediction tasks by adaptively selecting diffusion timesteps and consolidating their features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sub-optimal heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features in generative applications, which biases performance towards specific tasks.

Method: Proposed Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) modules, along with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, to optimize timestep features for few-shot dense prediction tasks.

Result: Empirical validation shows enhanced dense prediction performance using the learnable timestep consolidation approach on the challenging Taskonomy dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully improves dense prediction in few-shot scenarios and contributes to practical universal learning applications.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new road scene dataset, AVOID, designed to improve real-time detection of small road hazards in adverse conditions, providing benchmarks and ablation studies for relevant tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable detection of unexpected small road hazards under varying and adverse conditions in real-time remains a challenge due to limitations in existing road driving datasets.

Method: The authors created AVOID, a simulated dataset capturing road obstacles under diverse adverse conditions with associated semantic maps, LiDAR data, and waypoints. They benchmarked high-performing networks and conducted ablation studies on a multi-task network.

Result: The study benchmarks existing networks for obstacle detection and experiments with multi-task networks, providing insights into their performance on real-time visual perception tasks under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: AVOID improves the scope for real-time obstacle detection under challenging conditions and supports multiple visual perception tasks, making it a valuable contribution to autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-UAVBench, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-altitude UAV scenarios, revealing current model limitations and aiming to enhance robust UAV intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks do not address the unique challenges of low-altitude UAV scenarios, focusing instead on either specific tasks or broad domains, leaving a gap in evaluating general intelligence in UAV applications.

Method: The study introduces MM-UAVBench, a benchmark with 19 sub-tasks and over 5.7K annotated questions from UAV data, systematically evaluating perception, cognition, and planning capabilities in low-altitude scenarios.

Result: Experiments on 16 MLLMs demonstrate their struggle in low-altitude UAV scenarios due to challenges like spatial bias and multi-view understanding, highlighting critical limitations.

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench emphasizes the need for more robust, reliable models and encourages further research to address the challenges of UAV-related MLLM deployment.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Holi-DETR, a holistic detection model that improves fashion item detection using contextual information such as co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, and key-point relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion item detection is complicated due to challenges posed by diverse appearances and subcategory similarities. The paper aims to reduce these ambiguities by incorporating contextual information.

Method: The authors propose Holi-DETR, which integrates three types of contextual information (co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, and human body key-point relationships) into the architecture of the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its derivatives.

Result: The Holi-DETR model demonstrated improvements in average precision by 3.6 percentage points compared to the vanilla DETR and 1.1 percentage points compared to the more advanced Co-DETR.

Conclusion: By leveraging multiple types of contextual relationships, Holi-DETR significantly improves the detection of fashion items, highlighting the importance of holistic methods for fashion detection tasks.

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

TL;DR: UniMAGE proposes a novel unified AI framework for script drafting and key-shot design to assist non-experts in creating multi-shot films by unifying text and image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems treat script writing and key-shot design as separate processes, lacking the unified creative reasoning that a film director requires.

Method: UniMAGE employs a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture with a training paradigm called 'first interleaving, then disentangling,' allowing for combined script understanding and separation of tasks for better story logic and visual consistency.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing coherent scripts and consistent keyframe images.

Conclusion: UniMAGE bridges the gap between script and key-shot design within a unified model, significantly enhancing creative video production capabilities for general users.

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cost-effective strategy to enhance anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing by using a novel framework for generating synthetic defect images and a two-stage training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is the scarcity of real defect images in industrial manufacturing and the trade-off between cost-effective rule-based synthesis and realistic-but-expensive generative models.

Method: A framework leveraging a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and an image retrieval model is introduced. The retrieval model filters irrelevant outputs to enhance quality. Additionally, a two-stage training strategy is proposed, involving pre-training on rule-based data and fine-tuning with high-quality images.

Result: Experiments conducted on the MVTec AD dataset show that the approach improves anomaly detection performance while reducing costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances quality and cost in generating synthetic defect images, leading to better anomaly detection in industrial applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: SGPS method improves diffusion model-based inverse problem solving by correcting trajectory deviations and reducing error, needing fewer computational steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current iterative approaches for solving inverse problems with diffusion models require numerous steps due to accumulated errors, creating inefficiency.

Method: The paper introduces SGPS, which employs SURE gradient updates and PCA noise estimation to correct sampling trajectory deviations and mitigate noise-induced errors.

Result: SGPS achieves high-quality reconstructions in fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), outperforming existing methods in various inverse problems.

Conclusion: SGPS significantly improves accuracy and computational efficiency in inverse problem reconstruction compared to prevalent approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PEG-DRNet for detecting infrared gas leaks, utilizing novel modules for effective gas transport modeling, edge detection, and feature propagation across scales, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in detecting faint, small, semitransparent, and weak-boundary gas leaks critical for environmental safety and monitoring.

Method: The method involves designing PEG-DRNet with three key innovations: Gas Block for gas transport modeling, the AGPEO operator for edge detection, and CASR-PAN for content-adaptive feature propagation, emphasizing both local details and global context.

Result: PEG-DRNet achieved 29.8% overall AP, 84.3% AP50, and 25.3% small-object AP on the IIG dataset, outperforming CNN and Transformer-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PEG-DRNet balances accuracy and computational efficiency effectively and surpasses existing technologies in infrared gas leak detection on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

TL;DR: This paper presents a training-free, two-stage data pruning method to improve the efficiency and quality of training diffusion-based remote sensing generative models by intelligently selecting high-quality subsets of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of using large-scale remote sensing data for diffusion foundation models caused by redundancy, noise, and class imbalances, which hinder convergence and model performance.

Method: The proposed method is a two-stage data pruning approach. First, it uses an entropy-based criterion to remove low-information samples quickly. Then, it employs scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling, referencing RS scene classification datasets, to achieve fine-grained selection that balances uniformity and diversity in the dataset.

Result: The method enables significant data pruning (up to 85%) while improving training efficiency, convergence, and generation quality for diffusion models. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical and effective paradigm for creating remote sensing generative foundation models by optimizing the selection of training data, thereby improving downstream application results and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-source data in remote sensing and improve surface information accuracy for applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy for adaptive resolution control and Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism for cross-modal semantic consistency.

Result: Improves image captioning and cross-modal retrieval accuracy on RS-GPT4V dataset with better BLEU-4, CIDEr, and R@10 metrics compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, efficient approach for intelligent remote sensing interpretation, solidifying theoretical and technical foundations for multimodal remote sensing systems.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

### [251] [ViLaCD-R1: A Vision-Language Framework for Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23244)
*Xingwei Ma,Shiyang Feng,Bo Zhang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViLaCD-R1, a new framework for detecting changes in remote sensing imagery, which significantly improves semantic change detection and spatial accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for remote sensing change detection struggle with capturing high-level semantics and are prone to non-semantic perturbations. Current vision-language models improve semantics but suffer from poor spatial localization, boundary issues, and limited interpretability.

Method: The ViLaCD-R1 framework consists of two stages: a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) trained using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to produce a coarse change mask, and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD) for refined binary change detection.

Result: Experiments show ViLaCD-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, better semantic change recognition, improved localization, and suppresses non-semantic variations on multiple RSCD benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1 offers a robust and precise solution to overcome limitations in previous methods, particularly in semantic change recognition, fine spatial localization, and robustness to non-semantic changes.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

*Shin seong Kim,Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASemconsist presents a new framework for generating consistent character identities in text-to-image models across diverse prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results by balancing identity consistency and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the challenge of maintaining consistent character identity in sequential image generation while ensuring alignment with diverse textual prompts, which has been a trade-off in existing methods.

Method: ASemconsist modifies text embeddings for semantic control, utilizes padding embeddings as semantic containers based on FLUX analysis, employs an adaptive feature-sharing strategy for textual ambiguity, and introduces the Consistency Quality Score (CQS) for evaluation.

Result: The proposed framework achieves improved state-of-the-art performance in balancing identity consistency and prompt alignment in text-to-image models.

Conclusion: ASemconsist resolves the trade-off in text-to-image diffusion models and provides a new comprehensive metric for evaluating identity consistency and prompt alignment simultaneously, offering advancements in consistent sequential image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

*Masaya Takabe,Hiroshi Watanabe,Sujun Hong,Tomohiro Ikai,Zheming Fan,Ryo Ishimoto,Kakeru Sugimoto,Ruri Imichi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that enhances image representation by integrating segmentation priors to preserve edges and boundaries under compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of blurry or indistinct boundaries in 2D Gaussian Splatting methods caused by a lack of contour awareness when using fewer Gaussians.

Method: Incorporating object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation, constraining each Gaussian to specific segmentation regions, and introducing a warm-up training scheme.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved reconstruction quality around edges, particularly under high compression scenarios with fewer Gaussians, while maintaining fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: The Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework effectively resolves edge preservation issues in compressed image representations, enhancing visual quality without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

### [254] [Plug-and-Play Fidelity Optimization for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration via Cumulative Error Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23258)
*Tong Shao,Yusen Fu,Guoying Sun,Jingde Kong,Zhuotao Tian,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fidelity-optimization plugin called CEM for error correction methods in generated models, aimed at improving the fidelity of accelerated diffusion transformer-based image and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers generate high-quality content but their slow inference speed limits their practical applications. Existing acceleration methods come with computational errors that aren't effectively corrected by current fixed caching strategies.

Method: The paper proposes 'CEM', a plugin leveraging cumulative error minimization and predefined error sensitivity to optimize dynamic caching strategies using a dynamic programming algorithm. It integrates seamlessly with any error correction framework and introduces no extra computational cost.

Result: CEM significantly enhances generation fidelity across nine generative models, outperforming baseline methods including FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5, and Hunyuan.

Conclusion: CEM is a flexible, model-agnostic solution for improved acceleration and fidelity in generative models, adaptable to various acceleration budgets, and capable of broad generalization. It shows promise for accelerating diffusion models without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

*Xu Lin,Jinlong Peng,Zhenye Gan,Jiawen Zhu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces YOLO-Master, an advanced real-time object detection framework that employs instance-conditional adaptive computation for better resource allocation and detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional YOLO-like models utilize uniform computation for all inputs, leading to inefficient allocation of computational resources and reduced performance, especially on complex scenes.

Method: YOLO-Master incorporates an Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block where a lightweight dynamic routing network determines adaptive computation allocation based on scene complexity. Diverse experts specialize in different tasks to enhance resource efficiency.

Result: YOLO-Master demonstrates improved performance on five benchmarks, achieving 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency on MS COCO, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% AP and being 17.8% faster in inference.

Conclusion: YOLO-Master successfully optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and speed, especially excelling in dense scenes while retaining efficiency on simpler inputs for reliable real-time object detection.

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gestures and behavior-based emotions are intricate human behaviors, and recognizing them accurately could enhance interaction systems relying on video-based input.

Method: The study proposes two frameworks utilizing RGB and pose-based data representations, fused by Cross-Modal Token Fusion and InterFusion modules, leveraging models like MViTv2-S, 2s-AGCN, and SwinFace.

Result: Performance of the proposed method was evaluated on the iMiGUE dataset as part of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, achieving notable success including securing 2nd place in emotion prediction.

Conclusion: The frameworks integrate video and pose data effectively for micro-gesture and emotion prediction, indicating their potential for advancing tasks requiring nuanced human behavior modeling.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

Motivation: To assess the benefits of domain-specific tuning in multimodal models for medical imaging and to determine the effectiveness of MedGemma versus GPT-4.

Method: The study involved fine-tuning MedGemma using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and analyzing its diagnostic performance against GPT-4 through accuracy metrics, sensitivity evaluations, and confusion matrices.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4 in disease diagnosis with higher accuracy (80.37% for MedGemma vs 69.58% for GPT-4) and sensitivity in critical conditions like cancer and pneumonia.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning like LoRA is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing hallucinations in clinical applications, making MedGemma a promising tool in evidence-based medical reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce an emerging paradigm for medical imaging by interpreting scans through the lens of extensive clinical knowledge, offering a transformative approach to disease classification. This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD modeling approaches face challenges in automating the generation of accurate and editable models, coupled with limitations in handling sketch-based or annotated inputs in industrial contexts.

Method: The paper proposes the CME-CAD framework that combines Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT) and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL) to foster collaborative learning for generating precision CAD models.

Result: Their approach demonstrates improved accuracy, constraint compatibility, and editability in generated CAD models, supported by the introduction of the CADExpert benchmark tool with diverse annotated instances.

Conclusion: The CME-CAD paradigm and CADExpert benchmark offer advancements in automated CAD model generation, addressing both precision and scalability obstacles in industrial applications.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

### [259] [Visual Language Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies visual representation learning using a topological perspective, focusing on its structural and semantic organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding visual representation learning's structural implications for defining and organizing perceptual and semantic observations.

Method: A theoretical lens is applied, deriving consequences using the hypothesis that visual semantics require topological structures like a fiber bundle, with external supervision and model architecture requirements.

Result: The study contends that a semantic quotient space can't be derived solely through smooth transformations; instead, topological changes in representation supported by semantic supervision are essential.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a theoretical topological framework aligning with behavior in discriminative and multimodal models and connects to principles in statistical learning theory.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhanced methods for object counting that improve target object specification, accuracy, and efficiency by allowing descriptions of what not to count and utilizing automated pseudo-exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counting methods limit flexibility by requiring manual visual example annotation and cannot specify objects to exclude.

Method: The paper introduces text and visual specifications for exclusion, automated pseudo-exemplars for inference, and an extended counting model, CountGD++, integrated with LLMs.

Result: These innovations improve prompt flexibility, accuracy, and generalization across numerous datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The enhanced capabilities address key limitations, refining object counting methods with automatic annotation and exclusion, making them more effective and practical.

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly addressing issues like partial visibility, occlusion, and fragmented visual cues that hinder comprehensive spatial reasoning.

Method: The authors proposed a scalable multi-view data generation pipeline to create SpatialMosaic, which includes a dataset with 2M QA pairs and a benchmark SpatialMosaic-Bench with 1M QA pairs across six tasks. They also developed SpatialMosaicVLM, integrating 3D reconstruction as geometry encoders into vision-language models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpatialMosaic and SpatialMosaicVLM in improving spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view scenarios. The proposed data and tasks enhance model performance in fragmented visual cue settings.

Conclusion: The research introduces a scalable and robust approach for advancing spatial reasoning in VLMs using realistic datasets, benchmarks, and hybrid frameworks, effectively addressing key challenges in real-world multi-view scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing geometric constraints in matched pairs due to poor local geometric modeling and cross-stage optimization.

Method: Introduction of MGCA-Net, consisting of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module for adaptive attention and local/global relationship capture, and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus module for establishing geometric consistency.

Result: MGCA-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Conclusion: MGCA-Net improves robustness and accuracy in geometric constraint modeling, enabling reliable two-view correspondence learning with superior performance across tasks.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

*Yifei Li,Haoyuan He,Yu Zheng,Bingyao Yu,Wenzhao Zheng,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for robust, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) by introducing the NeXT-IMDL benchmark, which rigorously evaluates models' generalization capabilities beyond simplified cross-dataset testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current IMDL research, which often fails to generalize well across diverse AI-generated content, giving a misleading sense of progress due to oversimplified evaluation methods.

Method: The authors introduce NeXT-IMDL, a benchmark framework that evaluates IMDL models using cross-dimension protocols based on four dimensions: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. The approach aims to systematically test and diagnose models' generalization capabilities.

Result: Experiments on 11 models reveal that while current methods perform adequately within their original settings, they suffer critical performance degradation under NeXT-IMDL's rigorous evaluation protocols, highlighting significant generalization issues.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of developing robust IMDL models capable of handling diverse, real-world challenges. By providing the NeXT-IMDL benchmark and insights into current limitations, the paper seeks to steer future IMDL research towards achieving better generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

TL;DR: SoulX-LiveTalk introduces a 14B-parameter system for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation using advanced bidirectional attention and acceleration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome engineering challenges for real-time and infinite-duration avatar generation, addressing computational constraints and latency issues without sacrificing visual fidelity.

Method: They propose SoulX-LiveTalk with Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation and Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism alongside a full-stack inference suite for hybrid acceleration.

Result: SoulX-LiveTalk achieves sub-second start-up latency of 0.87s and real-time streaming at 32 FPS, delivering high-fidelity spatiotemporal coherence.

Conclusion: This work introduces a scalable and robust framework, setting a benchmark for real-time interactive digital human synthesis in terms of fidelity and responsiveness.

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

### [265] [SOFTooth: Semantics-Enhanced Order-Aware Fusion for Tooth Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23411)
*Xiaolan Li,Wanquan Liu,Pengcheng Li,Pengyu Jie,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth is a new method for 3D tooth instance segmentation that combines 2D boundary-aware semantics with 3D processing to overcome challenges such as boundary leakage and tooth identity inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to improve the accuracy of 3D tooth segmentation, which is challenging due to ambiguous boundaries, missing teeth, and uncommon anatomies like third molars. Existing 3D methods face issues such as boundary leakage and inconsistent tooth identities, while 2D methods are impractical for 3D workflows.

Method: The paper proposes SOFTooth, a 2D-3D fusion framework that uses 2D semantics from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) without requiring explicit 2D mask supervision. The method includes a point-wise residual gating module, center-guided mask refinement, and an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy to improve segmentation accuracy.

Result: SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and mean IoU on the 3DTeethSeg'22 dataset, particularly excelling in cases involving third molars, by effectively leveraging 2D semantics for 3D tooth segmentation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that 2D boundary-aware semantics can significantly enhance 3D tooth segmentation without additional fine-tuning of 2D models, addressing key challenges in the field and paving the way for improved clinical workflows.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

### [266] [Bridging Cognitive Gap: Hierarchical Description Learning for Artistic Image Aesthetics Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23413)
*Henglin Liu,Nisha Huang,Chang Liu,Jiangpeng Yan,Huijuan Huang,Jixuan Ying,Tong-Yee Lee,Pengfei Wan,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in aesthetic quality assessment using artistic images by introducing a large-scale dataset and an improved framework that combines aesthetic dimensions efficiently and processes textual descriptions with Long-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aesthetic quality assessment is important to develop human-aligned evaluation systems for AI-Generated Content but remains challenging due to complexity in visual perception, cognition, and emotion.

Method: The authors propose the RAD dataset (structured, large-scale, and low-cost generation) and ArtQuant framework (utilizing joint description generation and LLM decoders for better modeling of long-text semantics).

Result: ArtQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, reduces training epochs by 33%, and improves predictive accuracy in aesthetic assessment.

Conclusion: The paper contributes both a scalable dataset for aesthetic analysis and a framework minimizing semantic prediction entropy, offering tools to enhance research on human-aligned aesthetic assessment systems.

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

### [267] [DriveLaW:Unifying Planning and Video Generation in a Latent Driving World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23421)
*Tianze Xia,Yongkang Li,Lijun Zhou,Jingfeng Yao,Kaixin Xiong,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Kun Ma,Hangjun Ye,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriveLaW, a unified approach integrating video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems keep world prediction and motion planning as separate processes, limiting consistency and performance.

Method: DriveLaW uses a novel architecture combining 'DriveLaW-Video' for high-fidelity video forecasting and 'DriveLaW-Act' for diffusion-based motion planning, trained with a three-stage progressive strategy.

Result: DriveLaW achieves better results in video prediction (33.3% FID and 1.8% FVD improvements) and sets a record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Conclusion: DriveLaW demonstrates a unified framework's capability to improve both high-quality scenario prediction and reliable trajectory planning for autonomous driving.

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

### [268] [Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization via Stepwise Contrastive Policy-Pair Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23426)
*Dohyun Kim,Seungwoo Lyu,Seung Wook Kim,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO is a new method to improve generative quality and alignment in diffusion models by deriving supervision directly, reducing reliance on costly manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often fail to align outputs with detailed user intent and lack consistent aesthetic quality. Previous preference-based methods rely heavily on human-labeled datasets, which are inefficient and noisy.

Method: DDSPO introduces a preference optimization method that derives supervision signals directly across the denoising trajectory, using outputs from a pretrained reference model based on original and degraded prompts.

Result: The method significantly improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing methods while reducing supervision requirements.

Conclusion: DDSPO presents a practical and effective approach to augmenting generative models by optimizing preferences without the need for explicit reward models or human annotations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a benchmark called UncertSAM to stress-test SAM's segmentation in challenging conditions and explores the use of uncertainty quantification to improve model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of SAM and similar models, which struggle with segmentation tasks in shifted or challenging domains, by exploring the potential of uncertainty quantification to enhance robustness.

Method: The authors curated UncertSAM, a benchmark with eight datasets posing challenging segmentation conditions, evaluated lightweight uncertainty estimation methods, and assessed a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement technique.

Result: The evaluation revealed that a last-layer Laplace approximation effectively correlates uncertainty estimates with segmentation errors. Refinement methods showed limited but promising potential.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of integrating uncertainty estimation into foundation segmentation models for improved, domain-agnostic performance. The benchmark and code are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance. Our benchmark and code are made publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a real-time road surface monitoring system combining mobile camera data and acceleration data analyzed with deep learning and fuzzy logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance road surface monitoring for effective vehicle planning and active vehicle control systems, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that are costly and time-consuming.

Method: The system collects road surface data using a mobile phone camera and utilizes image-based deep learning algorithms like AlexNet, LeNet, VGG, and ResNet for classification. Acceleration data is also transformed into images and combined with camera data. Fuzzy logic is applied to account for weather and time variations.

Result: The proposed approach successfully classifies road surfaces into five categories (asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road) with over 95% accuracy. Comparisons between acceleration-based and image-based methods were made.

Conclusion: The integration of deep learning and fuzzy logic provides an efficient and highly accurate real-time road monitoring solution. This system can classify road surfaces based on camera and/or acceleration inputs under varying conditions.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealX3D, a real-world benchmark for 3D reconstruction and multi-view restoration under various physical degradations. It evaluates current methods and highlights their weaknesses in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction methods under realistic physical degradations and challenging real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors capture diverse physical corruptions (illumination, scattering, occlusion, blurring) at multiple levels using a standardized protocol. They provide high-resolution data, RAW images, depth scans, and derived 3D meshes, enabling rigorous evaluation of methods.

Result: Testing on RealX3D shows that both optimization-based and feed-forward approaches suffer significant quality reductions when faced with real-world physical degradation.

Conclusion: Current 3D reconstruction methods are highly fragile in real-world environments, emphasizing the need for more robust and adaptive solutions.

Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.

*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoFi-Dec, a training-free decoding framework improving visual grounding in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to reduce hallucination in their outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinated content that doesn't align with visual inputs, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. This paper aims to address this accuracy and reliability issue.

Method: CoFi-Dec combines generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. The framework utilizes multiple visual hypotheses formed via a text-to-image model and employs a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism to align predictions for consistent outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that CoFi-Dec significantly reduces hallucinations at both entity and semantic levels, outperforming other decoding strategies.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec enhances LVLM reliability and output fidelity without additional training, offering compatibility with various models. Its implementation is publicly accessible for further exploration.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve deterministic I2I translation by addressing challenges in high fidelity and faithfulness to ground truth images.

Method: The proposed model leverages the Brownian bridge dynamics and dual neural network-based approximators to ensure high image quality and negligible variance for deterministic I2I tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Dual-approx Bridge consistently outperforms existing stochastic and deterministic models on benchmark datasets regarding image quality and faithfulness to ground truth.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge is an effective and efficient solution for deterministic I2I translation tasks, with negligible output variance and better fidelity compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCI-Net for improving point cloud registration, focusing on better feature representation and robust registration through multi-domain context integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for point cloud registration struggle to capture implicit semantics and structural consistency due to their reliance on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies.

Method: MCI-Net includes a graph neighborhood aggregation module, progressive context interaction module for feature refinement, and a dynamic inlier selection method for optimizing registration accuracy.

Result: MCI-Net achieves a registration recall of 96.4% on 3DMatch, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets.

Conclusion: By aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains, MCI-Net enhances the quality of point cloud registration, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

*Shuyuan Lin,Hailiang Liao,Qiang Qi,Junjie Huang,Taotao Lai,Jian Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel CNN-based network (SC-Net) improves two-view correspondence learning tasks, enhancing accuracy in motion field generation and refinement, proven through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN backbones struggle with tailored global context aggregation and motion field oversmoothing in scenes with large disparity.

Method: Proposed SC-Net incorporates AFR module for position-awareness, BFA module for bilateral refinement, and PAR module for consistency in motion vectors recovery.

Result: SC-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Conclusion: SC-Net effectively addresses limitations of conventional CNN backbones, enhancing precision and robustness in correspondence learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

### [278] [TV-RAG: A Temporal-aware and Semantic Entropy-Weighted Framework for Long Video Retrieval and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23483)
*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang,Jun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-RAG is a training-free architecture designed to enhance reasoning in lengthy videos, addressing limitations in existing Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) by incorporating temporal alignment and entropy-guided semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Video Language Models struggle with long videos due to narrow temporal windows and inability to capture fine-grained semantic shifts. Standard text-based retrieval pipelines ignore temporal interdependence among multimedia features.

Method: TV-RAG introduces two mechanisms: (i) a time-decay retrieval module for multimedia context-aware ranking, and (ii) an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler for selecting representative frames with reduced redundancy. These mechanisms integrate temporal and semantic signals.

Result: TV-RAG consistently outperforms leading baselines across benchmarks like Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving long-video reasoning.

Conclusion: TV-RAG provides a lightweight upgrade for LVLMs without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. Its dual-level reasoning routines effectively address limitations in handling long-video scenarios.

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

*Mingyuan Jiu,Hailong Zhu,Wenchuan Wei,Hichem Sahbi,Rongrong Ji,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PanCAN, a novel approach for multi-label classification that effectively integrates multi-order and cross-scale context modeling, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to visual recognition often overlook cross-scale contextual interactions between objects, limiting their capability to fully understand complex scenes.

Method: PanCAN models multi-order neighborhood relationships at various scales using random walks combined with an attention mechanism and cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: PanCAN demonstrated competitive and superior performance across NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks, improving multi-label classification results.

Conclusion: PanCAN effectively addresses limitations in context modeling by leveraging multi-order and cross-scale features, marking a significant advancement in multi-label classification.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

TL;DR: IdentityStory is a framework for generating consistent human-centric stories with multiple characters while maintaining facial and identity consistency across images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in human-centric story generation, such as preserving detailed face consistency and coordinating multiple characters in sequential images.

Method: The method involves two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery for cohesive character identity extraction and Re-denoising Identity Injection for identity-preserving image generation.

Result: Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark show that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, especially in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations.

Conclusion: IdentityStory effectively improves human-centric story generation, enabling consistent identity maintenance across sequential images and applications like infinite-length stories and dynamic character compositions.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

### [281] [Iterative Inference-time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23532)
*Hexin Zhang,Dong Li,Jie Huang,Bingzhou Wang,Xueyang Fu,Zhengjun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAFS, a training-free framework tackling the trade-off between perceiving high-frequency detail and maintaining low-frequency structural accuracy in image super-resolution diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image super-resolution models face challenges in balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity. Traditional inference-time scaling methods fail to optimally resolve this trade-off.

Method: The paper proposes Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a framework using iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion to balance high-frequency and low-frequency elements in images.

Result: Experiments show that IAFS improves perceptual detail and structural accuracy, outperforming prior inference-time scaling approaches in various models.

Conclusion: IAFS is an effective method for overcoming the perception-fidelity conflict in diffusion-based super-resolution, achieving better trade-offs and more accurate image reconstructions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyMS introduces a training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization by ensuring text alignment, identity preservation, and layout control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-subject customization, such as missing subjects or conflicts, and improve scalability and efficiency in layout-guided image synthesis.

Method: AnyMS uses a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism and pre-trained image adapters to harmonize text prompts, subject images, and layout constraints during image generation.

Result: Extensive experiments prove AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art results, enabling complex compositions and scalability for layouts with numerous subjects.

Conclusion: AnyMS provides a scalable, efficient, and training-free solution for multi-subject customization, overcoming key limitations of existing approaches and offering high-quality results.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFound is an advanced multimodal model designed to improve pathological diagnosis by mimicking clinical workflows, incorporating evidence-seeking inference, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in static inference paradigms of current pathological models and improve diagnostic accuracy through dynamic and evidence-seeking workflows.

Method: PathFound combines pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to support evidence-seeking inference and refine diagnoses.

Result: PathFound consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance in diverse clinical scenarios and effectively identifying subtle pathological features.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking workflows, as implemented in PathFound, are highly effective for computational pathology and align more closely with real-world diagnostic practices.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

### [284] [PurifyGen: A Risk-Discrimination and Semantic-Purification Model for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23546)
*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PurifyGen, a training-free solution for enhancing the safety of text-to-image (T2I) generation by purifying prompts through dual-space transformation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional safety methods like text blacklisting and content classification in T2I generation, which are prone to circumvention and require extensive resources.

Method: A novel method called PurifyGen is introduced, which evaluates the safety of prompt tokens using complementary semantic distances and applies a dual-space transformation to remove harmful semantics while emphasizing safe ones, without altering the model's original weights.

Result: PurifyGen demonstrated superior performance in reducing unsafe content across five datasets, proving its robustness and competitiveness with training-dependent methods.

Conclusion: PurifyGen offers a theoretically grounded, plug-and-play solution for safer T2I generation that generalizes well to unseen prompts and models, outperforming existing methods in both safety and flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

TL;DR: RxnBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding chemical reactions from scientific PDFs, revealing a need for improved reasoning and visual processing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how well MLLMs can comprehend and process the unique graphical and textual formats in chemical literature.

Method: Developed a benchmark, RxnBench, comprising Single-Figure QA (SF-QA) and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), designed to test models' capabilities in visual perception, reasoning, and cross-modal integration using curated reaction schemes and scientific articles.

Result: MLLMs were found proficient in extracting explicit text but struggled with deep chemical reasoning, achieving less than 50% accuracy on the more challenging FD-QA task.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop domain-specific visual encoders and enhanced reasoning engines to enable MLLMs to function as autonomous AI chemists.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the benefits of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, proven effective in understanding tasks, to generation tasks in Multimodal Large Language Models, which lacks generalization and adaptation.

Method: The authors propose ThinkGen, a framework with a decoupled architecture combining pretrained MLLM for instruction synthesis and Diffusion Transformer for image generation. They introduce a SepGRPO-based training method for alternating reinforcement learning between modules.

Result: ThinkGen demonstrates outstanding performance in a variety of generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkGen offers a novel think-driven visual generation framework that effectively utilizes CoT reasoning for generalization across diverse datasets, providing a robust solution for generative scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

Motivation: The rapid growth of imaging devices and the vast amount of image data generated daily demand efficient and accurate image denoising techniques.

Method: The authors propose Haar-tSVD, which uses t-SVD combined with Haar transform for denoising. It operates as a parallelizable plug-and-play model without requiring local basis learning, with adaptive noise estimation for robustness.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of Haar-tSVD on various image denoising datasets, balancing speed and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD is an efficient and effective denoising algorithm that leverages theoretical connections between PCA and Haar transforms, establishing its utility for practical noise removal scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing reactive defense methods that struggle with multimodal safety risks from evolving generative models.

Method: ProGuard uses a modality-balanced dataset with 87K samples annotated for a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, trained through reinforcement learning with a synonym-bank-based reward for concise risk reasoning.

Result: ProGuard achieves strong results: comparable binary safety classification performance with large models, improved unsafe content categorization, and notable advancements in OOD risk detection (+52.6%) and description (+64.8%).

Conclusion: ProGuard effectively addresses multimodal safety risks proactively, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating significant OOD risk moderation capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on developing real-time multimodal (text, image, audio) interactive video generation through improved distillation techniques, enabling reduced latency and high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models require bidirectional attention over all video frames, which hinders real-time interaction. Current distillation approaches focus on text-to-video, limiting efficiency and natural interaction. This paper aims to address these limitations by enabling real-time, multimodal video generation.

Method: The study improves distillation techniques, optimizing inputs, initialization, and on-policy schedules. It integrates these improvements into a model that is paired with audio language models and advanced video inference techniques, creating a real-time multimodal avatar system called LiveTalk.

Result: The proposed model achieves the visual quality of full-step diffusion models with 20x less inference cost and latency on tasks like avatar video generation, significantly improving response speed.

Conclusion: The LiveTalk system demonstrates state-of-the-art multi-turn video coherence and content quality, enabling seamless human-AI interaction with real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations of vision-language models (VLMs) in fine-grained perception by introducing the TWIN dataset and task, improving perceptual precision and performance on fine-grained benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack fine-grained visual perception due to training on general recognition tasks, which reinforces visual biases and overlooks subtle details.

Method: The paper proposes the TWIN dataset with 561,000 image-pair queries for nuanced object recognition and also introduces the FGVQA benchmark suite for evaluating fine-grained visual understanding.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN leads to a 19.3% performance improvement on the FGVQA benchmark without loss on general VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: TWIN represents a scalable and practical addition to open-source datasets, significantly advancing the perceptual abilities of VLMs for better fine-grained recognition across various domains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

Method: The authors propose three contributions: 1) Develop an augmented NIR dataset, 2) Create a two-stage detection pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0 to reduce false positives, and 3) Introduce Patched-YOLO for better small-object detection in RGB images.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate superior performance in night-time fire detection and improved object detection accuracy compared to prior techniques.

Conclusion: The advancements presented address key challenges in fire detection by improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives from artificial lights in challenging imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

### [292] [Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597)
*Janani Annur Thiruvengadam,Kiran Mayee Nabigaru,Anusha Kovi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study tackles the challenge of detecting pancreatic tumors given their subtle and varied manifestations, presenting a Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework that employs advanced segmentation, feature extraction, and classification techniques, achieving a high accuracy of 96.23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting pancreatic neoplasm early is challenging due to minimal tumor contrast, wide anatomical variations in CT scans, and the need for a system that enhances subtle visual cues and generalizes well on multimodal imaging data.

Method: The study proposes an SRFA framework involving preprocessing, segmentation via MAGRes-UNet, DenseNet-121 for hierarchical feature extraction, a hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy, and classification using a hybrid model coupling Vision Transformer with EfficientNet-B3. Dual optimization via SSA and GWO is employed for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: The developed model achieved outstanding performance with 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity, outperforming traditional CNNs and transformer-based models.

Conclusion: The SRFA framework shows strong potential as a reliable tool for early detection of pancreatic tumors, demonstrating superior accuracy and performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

*Shu Pu,Boya Zeng,Kaichen Zhou,Mengyu Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an evaluation framework to analyze memorization behaviors in 3D generative models and suggests strategies to reduce memorization while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether 3D generative models memorize training shapes, potentially leading to data leakage and reduced diversity in synthesized results. Addressing this problem would enhance 3D model reliability and diversity.

Method: The authors propose a framework to quantify memorization in existing and new 3D generative models, coupled with controlled experiments using the Vecset diffusion model.

Result: Memorization is influenced by data modality, diversity, conditioning mechanisms, modeling designs, guidance scales, Vecset lengths, and rotation augmentation. It peaks under certain conditions but can be mitigated effectively.

Conclusion: The paper provides empirical insights into memorization, along with practical strategies to reduce it without affecting the quality of generated 3D shapes.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module tailored for end-to-end perception in autonomous driving. HAT refines object alignment using adaptive multi-hypothesis decoding, improving temporal detectors, trackers, accuracy, and collision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimal motion alignment across frames caused by variation in motion states and object features for autonomous driving systems.

Method: HAT employs multi-explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware proposals. It additionally uses multi-hypothesis decoding combining semantic and motion cues to offer optimal temporal alignment for objects without direct supervision.

Result: HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers on datasets like nuScenes, achieving state-of-the-art tracking results and enhanced AD performance with increased accuracy and reduced collision rates.

Conclusion: HAT provides robust and efficient object alignment for AD, improving perception and planning, especially under challenging conditions where semantics are unreliable.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

*Keda Tao,Wenjie Du,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAgent introduces an active perception model that improves fine-grained audio-visual reasoning and multimodal alignment via dynamic planning and tool orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current omnimodal large language models struggle with fine-grained cross-modal understanding and multimodal alignment.

Method: OmniAgent employs dynamic planning, audio-guided perception, and tool orchestration to focus perceptual attention on task-relevant cues.

Result: OmniAgent demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming other leading models by 10%-20% on audio-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper shifts the paradigm from passive multimodal response generation to active multimodal inquiry, enhancing audio-visual understanding.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

### [296] [IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667)
*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IDT, a transformer-based framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition, overcoming view consistency issues and achieving better decomposition results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of achieving view-consistency in multi-view intrinsic image decomposition, which is fundamental for visual understanding.

Method: IDT (Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer) uses a transformer-based attention mechanism to process multiple input images in a single feed-forward pass, grounded in a physically modeled image decomposition into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading.

Result: IDT demonstrated superior results in decomposing images into cleaner reflectance, coherent shading, and well-isolated specular components, with improved multi-view consistency on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: IDT offers a robust solution for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition, combining interpretability, controllability, and better cross-view consistency than existing methods.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

### [297] [Diffusion Knows Transparency: Repurposing Video Diffusion for Transparent Object Depth and Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23705)
*Shaocong Xu,Songlin Wei,Qizhe Wei,Zheng Geng,Hong Li,Licheng Shen,Qianpu Sun,Shu Han,Bin Ma,Bohan Li,Chongjie Ye,Yuhang Zheng,Nan Wang,Saining Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method leveraging video diffusion models to address difficulties in perceiving transparent objects, achieving state-of-the-art results in depth and video normal estimation for transparency-rich scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of effective perception of transparent objects, which traditional systems struggle with due to optical complexities such as refraction and reflection.

Method: The authors create a synthetic video dataset (TransPhy3D) and employ video diffusion models with lightweight LoRA adapters. RGB, depth, and normals are rendered using Blender and ray tracing tools. Their model, DKT, is trained with these datasets for translating video depth and normal estimations.

Result: The model demonstrates zero-shot state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real benchmarks (e.g., ClearPose, DREDS), achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency. It also enhances grasping success rates for translucent, reflective, and diffuse surfaces.

Conclusion: The study argues that diffusion models have an inherent understanding of transparency and can be efficiently repurposed for robust, label-free perception in manipulation tasks involving transparent objects.

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Stream-DiffVSR, a fast and causally conditioned diffusion-based video super-resolution method optimized for low-latency online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video super-resolution methods provide strong perceptual quality but are impractical for latency-sensitive scenarios due to reliance on future frames and slow denoising processes.

Method: Stream-DiffVSR employs a causally conditioned framework using a distilled denoiser for quick inference, Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) for motion-aligned cues, and a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) for enhanced details and coherence.

Result: Stream-DiffVSR achieves a processing time of 0.328 seconds per 720p frame on RTX4090, offers improved perceptual quality compared to SOTA online methods, and reduces latency by over 130 times compared to prior diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR sets a new benchmark for low-latency diffusion-based VSR, making it suitable for practical online deployment scenarios with significant reduction in initial delay and latency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

*Ruifan Chu,Anbang Wang,Xiuxiu Bai,Shuai Liu,Xiaoshe Dong*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing GPU kernel performance for high-performance computing by using a method that avoids expensive full application builds and runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels in high-performance computing is challenging due to the cost and difficulty of expert manual tuning, as well as inefficiencies in current large language model (LLM) approaches.

Method: The framework extracts hotspot kernels, autonomously completes them into minimal executable programs, and then iteratively optimizes and evaluates these kernels outside the full application. Error repair and performance pattern inheritance are employed for optimization.

Result: The framework yielded significant speedups: 5.05x on NVIDIA GPUs (PolyBench), 7.77x on DCU (PolyBench), 1.77x on AMD APP SDK, and 1.25x on large-scale supercomputing application kernels.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical, cost-effective solution for optimizing GPU kernels with cross-platform portability and no source dependencies, exceeding prior LLM optimization results.

Abstract: In high-performance computing, hotspot GPU kernels are primary bottlenecks, and expert manual tuning is costly and hard to port. Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation. We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization. The approach requires no full-source dependencies, offers cross-platform portability, and enables practical, low-cost GPU kernel optimization.

*Yongjie Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), optimizing distributed system hashing by improving load balance and efficiency, with reduced lookup cost and lower system churn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in load balance and system efficiency in distributed systems caused by traditional ring-based and multi-probe consistent hashing methods.

Method: LRH combines a token ring structure with cache-local HRW within neighboring physical nodes (C candidates). It employs binary search and precomputed offsets to locate keys and choose winners, reducing computational costs.

Result: LRH achieves better load balance (reducing Max/Avg load to 1.0947), faster lookup speeds (~6.8x faster than multi-probe hashing), and efficient churn management under system changes.

Conclusion: Local Rendezvous Hashing provides a scalable and efficient hashing method that improves load balance and lookup speeds while minimizing system churn, making it suitable for dynamic distributed systems.

Abstract: Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.

*Eddy Truyen,Wouter Joosen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to optimize CPU and memory resource allocation for microservices during the Release phase of the DevOps lifecycle, showing that different approaches suit different goals such as reducing cost or improving precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficiently explored optimization of resource configurations during the Release phase in DevOps, highlighting inefficiencies when relying solely on auto-scaling mechanisms that adjust resources during operations.

Method: The authors utilize an existing offline performance optimization framework and evaluate it with the TeaStore microservice application. Different optimization algorithms are compared statistically, focusing on trade-offs between sampling costs, optimization outcomes, and appropriate application scenarios.

Result: Findings suggest that upfront factor screening is effective for reducing the search space and optimizing resource configuration within a limited sampling budget. Without such screening, Bayesian optimization performs better when aiming for near-optimal configurations.

Conclusion: Optimizing CPU and memory allocation in the Release phase can significantly enhance resource utilization for microservices. The choice of optimization approach should depend on the objectives, such as cost-efficiency or proximity to optimal resource use.

Abstract: This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GPU-Virt-Bench, a benchmarking framework for assessing GPU virtualization systems across various metrics like performance, isolation, memory behavior, and error recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for efficient GPU resource sharing in multi-tenant environments, driven by the rise of AI and LLM workloads, yet existing solutions like MIG are hardware-restricted and lack standardized benchmarks for alternatives.

Method: A benchmarking framework, GPU-Virt-Bench, was developed to evaluate GPU virtualization systems using 56 metrics covering aspects such as overhead, quality, memory bandwidth, and multi-GPU performance.

Result: GPU-Virt-Bench successfully benchmarks both software alternatives (HAMi-core, BUD-FCSP) and hardware baselines (simulated MIG), revealing key differences that influence resource deployment decisions.

Conclusion: GPU-Virt-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation tool, enabling informed decision-making in GPU resource sharing across diverse systems, ensuring better isolation and performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of GPU-accelerated workloads, particularly in artificial intelligence and large language model (LLM) inference, has created unprecedented demand for efficient GPU resource sharing in cloud and container environments. While NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology provides hardware-level isolation, its availability is limited to high-end datacenter GPUs. Software-based virtualization solutions such as HAMi-core and BUD-FCSP offer alternatives for broader GPU families but lack standardized evaluation methodologies. We present GPU-Virt-Bench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework that evaluates GPU virtualization systems across 56 performance metrics organized into 10 categories. Our framework measures overhead, isolation quality, LLM-specific performance, memory bandwidth, cache behavior, PCIe throughput, multi-GPU communication, scheduling efficiency, memory fragmentation, and error recovery. GPU-Virt-Bench enables systematic comparison between software virtualization approaches and ideal MIG behavior, providing actionable insights for practitioners deploying GPU resources in multi-tenant environments. We demonstrate the framework's utility through evaluation of HAMi-core, BUD-FCSP, and simulated MIG baselines, revealing performance characteristics critical for production deployment decisions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new user interaction paradigm, emphasizing user sovereignty and memory decoupling within the Agentic Web era. This reduces data lock-in and cognitive overload via Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues like data lock-in and cognitive overload in the transitioning web ecosystem and provide a more efficient interaction framework.

Method: Introduces the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA) with an orthogonal decoupling design for storage, computation, and interaction, coupled with the Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism for governance.

Result: Demonstrates a 27-35% reduction in token consumption, a 72-88% cognitive load reduction compared to standard systems, and improved Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

Conclusion: The SoDA framework is pivotal for efficient, decentralized, and low-friction interaction in the new Agentic Web landscape.

Abstract: As the internet evolves from the mobile App-dominated Attention Economy to the Intent-Interconnection of the Agentic Web era, existing interaction modes fail to address the escalating challenges of data lock-in and cognitive overload. Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These results demonstrate that the SoDA is the essential interaction infrastructure for building an efficient, low-friction, and decentralized Agentic Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices faces challenges due to high parameter counts and computational demands.

Method: A combination of structured model pruning and multi-objective optimization is employed to adapt network capacity to diverse device constraints.

Result: Using MVCNN for 3D object recognition, the approach reduces inference latency by 1.2x to 5.0x and ensures user-specified accuracy and memory footprint bounds.

Conclusion: View-adaptive compression effectively balances performance and resource constraints, enabling practical deployment of complex vision models on edge devices.

Abstract: Deep distributed networks (DNNs) have become central to modern computer vision, yet their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains hindered by substantial parameter counts and computational demands. Here, we present an approach to the efficient deployment of distributed DNNs that jointly respects hardware limitations and preserves task performance. Our method integrates a structured model pruning with a multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to heterogeneous device constraints. We demonstrate this framework using Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN), a state-of-the-art architecture for 3D object recognition, by quantifying the contribution of individual views to classification accuracy and allocating pruning budgets, respectively. Experimental results show that the resulting models satisfy user-specified bounds on accuracy and memory footprint while reducing inference latency by factors ranging from 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms. These findings suggest that performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

*Amur Saqib Pal,Muhammad Mohsin Ghaffar,Faisal Shafait,Christian Weis,Norbert Wehn*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces HLS4PC, a parameterizable FPGA-based acceleration framework for 3D point cloud processing that improves efficiency and delivers significantly higher throughput than counterparts on GPUs and CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured nature of 3D point cloud data causes inefficiencies like high memory and computational demands, leading to underutilization of resources on traditional GPUs, which hampers real-time performance in applications requiring safety.

Method: Introduced HLS4PC, an FPGA acceleration framework utilizing parallelization and algorithmic optimizations, including hardware-aware compression techniques to generate a lightweight model, PointMLP-Lite.

Result: PointMLP-Lite retains accuracy with reduced complexity (4x reduction, only 2% accuracy drop) and achieves 3.56x, 2.3x, and 22x throughput improvements over prior FPGA, GPU, and CPU implementations, respectively.

Conclusion: HLS4PC offers significant computational and energy efficiency gains for 3D point cloud processing, making it suitable for real-time tasks in safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Point-based 3D point cloud models employ computation and memory intensive mapping functions alongside NN layers for classification/segmentation, and are executed on server-grade GPUs. The sparse, and unstructured nature of 3D point cloud data leads to high memory and computational demand, hindering real-time performance in safety critical applications due to GPU under-utilization. To address this challenge, we present HLS4PC, a parameterizable HLS framework for FPGA acceleration. Our approach leverages FPGA parallelization and algorithmic optimizations to enable efficient fixed-point implementations of both mapping and NN functions. We explore several hardware-aware compression techniques on a state-of-the-art PointMLP-Elite model, including replacing FPS with URS, parameter quantization, layer fusion, and input-points pruning, yielding PointMLP-Lite, a 4x less complex variant with only 2% accuracy drop on ModelNet40. Secondly, we demonstrate that the FPGA acceleration of the PointMLP-Lite results in 3.56x higher throughput than previous works. Furthermore, our implementation achieves 2.3x and 22x higher throughput compared to the GPU and CPU implementations, respectively.

### [306] [HybridFlow: Adaptive Task Scheduling for Fast and Token-Efficient LLM Inference in Edge-Cloud Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22137)
*Jiangwen Dong,Jiayu Li,Wanyu Lin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HybridFlow is an inference framework designed for efficient edge-cloud collaborative reasoning in LLMs, reducing latency and token consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of inference latency and token inefficiencies when using large language models on resource-limited edge devices.

Method: Proposes HybridFlow with two stages: dynamic task decomposition & parallel execution, and resource-aware subtask routing to optimize edge-cloud collaboration.

Result: Evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows HybridFlow reduces inference time and token usage while keeping accuracy competitive.

Conclusion: HybridFlow is an effective solution for improving real-time collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud systems in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and problem-solving abilities, yet their substantial inference latency and token consumption pose major challenges for real-time deployment on resource-limited edge devices. Recent efforts toward edge-cloud collaboration have attempted to mitigate this issue, but most existing methods adopt coarse-grained task allocation strategies-assigning entire queries either to the edge or the cloud. Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states. Comprehensive evaluations on GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME, and LiveBench-Reasoning demonstrate that HybridFlow effectively reduces end-to-end inference time and overall token usage while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Cleave introduces a decentralized training framework for foundation models utilizing edge devices to rival cloud-based performance while addressing challenges like scalability, device limitations, and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to democratize the development of foundation models by utilizing edge devices for training, addressing existing limitations such as high costs, limited scalability, and inefficiency in current methods.

Method: Cleave employs a selective hybrid tensor parallelism method combined with a parameter server-centric training framework. It optimizes device selection and workload distribution through a cost optimization model and tackles challenges of scalability and dynamism across edge devices.

Result: Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training performance, supports 8x more devices than existing methods, achieves up to 10x faster per-batch training time, and is 100x faster in recovery from device failures than prior approaches.

Conclusion: Cleave enables efficient and scalable training of large foundation models using edge devices, demonstrating that edge-based approaches can viably rival centralized cloud-based training.

Abstract: The ecosystem behind foundation model development today is highly centralized and limited to large-scale cloud data center operators: training foundation models is costly, needing immense compute resources. Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.
  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.
  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework for deploying multi-agent systems powered by large language models on serverless GPU platforms, achieving 85% latency reduction and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of multi-agent systems on serverless GPU infrastructures faces challenges due to workload heterogeneity, varying computational demands, and cost concerns.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic GPU resource allocation framework with an O(N) complexity algorithm that allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum requirements.

Result: Simulations show that the proposed adaptive framework outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies in terms of latency reduction, cost, and GPU utilization.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, cost-efficient solution for deploying multi-agent AI systems using serverless GPU resources, maintaining quality of service through dynamic resource adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex reasoning tasks through collaborative intelligence. However, efficiently deploying these systems on serverless GPU platforms presents significant resource allocation challenges due to heterogeneous agent workloads, varying computational demands, and the need for cost-effective scaling. This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.

### [309] [TL: Automatic End-to-End Compiler of Tile-Based Languages for Spatial Dataflow Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22168)
*Wei Li,Zhenyu Bai,Heru Wang,Pranav Dangi,Zhiqiang Zhang,Cheng Tan,Huiying Lan,Weng-Fai Wong,Tulika Mitra*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'TL,' a compiler framework for efficiently mapping tile-based programs like Triton kernels to spatial dataflow accelerators, enabling higher performance and programmability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial dataflow accelerators improve efficiency by reducing global memory bottlenecks, but their limited programmability restricts adoption due to the difficulty of mapping workloads effectively onto hardware.

Method: The TL framework addresses workload mapping challenges through a hardware representation model that captures architecture-specific details (e.g., interconnects, memory, compute), enabling optimizations across diverse dataflow architectures. It integrates with the MLIR ecosystem.

Result: TL successfully handles workload distribution across spatially distributed cores, exploiting on-chip networks and distributed memories for increased data reuse and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: TL represents a scalable end-to-end framework that makes spatial dataflow accelerators more programmable, unlocking their potential for wider adoption and enhanced energy- and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Spatial dataflow accelerators are a promising direction for next-generation computer systems because they can reduce the memory bottlenecks of traditional von Neumann machines such as CPUs and GPUs. They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets. TL is built on the MLIR ecosystem and defines a generic entry point for different front-ends and an end point for different back-ends.

TL;DR: MPK is a compiler and runtime that boosts multi-GPU model inference into a single high-performance megakernel, cutting inference latency up to 1.7x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in multi-GPU inference systems by creating a more optimized and streamlined execution process.

Method: MPK utilizes SM-level graph representation for GPU optimization and integrates a compiler for optimized task generation and a decentralized runtime for single mega-kernel execution.

Result: MPK reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 1.7x compared to existing systems, nearing hardware limits for performance.

Conclusion: MPK offers a major leap in multi-GPU inference efficiency through innovative compiler and runtime integration with minimal developer effort, and its source code is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Mirage Persistent Kernel (MPK), the first compiler and runtime system that automatically transforms multi-GPU model inference into a single high-performance megakernel. MPK introduces an SM-level graph representation that captures data dependencies at the granularity of individual streaming multiprocessors (SMs), enabling cross-operator software pipelining, fine-grained kernel overlap, and other previously infeasible GPU optimizations. The MPK compiler lowers tensor programs into highly optimized SM-level task graphs and generates optimized CUDA implementations for all tasks, while the MPK in-kernel parallel runtime executes these tasks within a single mega-kernel using decentralized scheduling across SMs. Together, these components provide end-to-end kernel fusion with minimal developer effort, while preserving the flexibility of existing programming models. Our evaluation shows that MPK significantly outperforms existing kernel-per-operator LLM serving systems by reducing end-to-end inference latency by up to 1.7x, pushing LLM inference performance close to hardware limits. MPK is publicly available at https://github.com/mirage-project/mirage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in executing complex workflows on supercomputers, requiring expertise in handling computational tasks and ensuring reproducibility.

Method: The study presents AiiDAlab, a platform designed for intuitive web-based interaction with computational workflows, underpinned by the AiiDA engine for simulation provenance.

Result: AiiDAlab has expanded its application areas to quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and experimental data analysis, facilitating ease of use, integration with ELNs, and adherence to FAIR principles.

Conclusion: By simplifying research processes and improving accessibility, AiiDAlab supports diverse scientific fields and educational initiatives, enabling reproducible and data-centric research.

Abstract: With the availability of ever-increasing computational capabilities, robust and automated research workflows are essential to enable and facilitate the execution and orchestration of large numbers of interdependent simulations in supercomputer facilities. However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).

*Muhammad Zeeshan Karamat,Sadman Saif,Christiana Chamon Garcia*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BitFlipScope, a framework to identify and recover from bit-flip faults in large language models, ensuring resilience and trustworthy deployment in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to bit-flip faults caused by hardware degradation, radiation, or attacks like Rowhammer, which lead to unpredictable or dangerous behavior. Fault localization is essential to diagnose and address these issues efficiently without full retraining.

Method: BitFlipScope employs two strategies: (1) Differential analysis using a clean reference model to detect and localize faults through anomalous evaluations. (2) Residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer faults directly from the corrupted model in the absence of a reference.

Result: The framework effectively identifies fault-impacted regions and supports lightweight model recovery, eliminating the need for fine-tuning or full retraining.

Conclusion: BitFlipScope enhances fault diagnosis and recovery for LLMs, enabling trustworthy and resilient deployment in environments prone to hardware faults and adversarial threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in practical and safety-critical settings are increasingly susceptible to bit-flip faults caused by hardware degradation, cosmic radiation, or deliberate fault-injection attacks such as Rowhammer. These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing powerful yet underused mobile devices, like iOS phones, to improve machine learning processes in weaker compute environments locally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning setups rely on powerful compute systems or expensive cloud resources, which limits the application in restricted environments. There is a need to leverage alternative, accessible systems to achieve computational efficiency locally.

Method: The authors propose a proof-of-concept system that leverages pipeline parallelism on iOS devices to conduct modest model training, batch inference, and tool usage for agentic large-resource models, addressing limitations like memory and thermal management.

Result: The system demonstrates successful acceleration in computational tasks using iOS devices, making them viable for local machine learning applications in restricted environments.

Conclusion: Mobile devices, particularly iOS phones, can contribute considerably to local machine learning setups when properly implemented, offering new opportunities for resource-constrained computing conditions.

Abstract: Practical utilization of large-scale machine learning requires a powerful compute setup, a necessity which poses a significant barrier to engagement with such artificial intelligence in more restricted system environments. While cloud computing offers a solution to weaker local environments, certain situations like training involving private or sensitive data, physical environments not available through the cloud, or higher anticipated usage costs, necessitate computing locally. We explore the potential to improve weaker local compute systems at zero additional cost by taking advantage of ubiquitous yet underutilized resources: mobile phones. Specifically, recent iOS phones are equipped with surprisingly powerful processors, but they also face limitations like memory constraints, thermal throttling, and OS sandboxing. We present a proof-of-concept system demonstrating a novel approach to harness an iOS device via distributed pipeline parallelism, achieving significant benefits in a lesser compute environment by accelerating modest model training, batch inference, and agentic LRM tool-usage. We discuss practical use-cases, limitations, and directions for future work. The findings of this paper highlight the potential for the improving commonplace mobile devices to provide greater contributions to machine learning.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MatKV, a method to optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language model (LLM) inference by precomputing and storing key-value vectors, significantly reducing time and power consumption during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference in LLM-based generative AI now dominates cost and power consumption, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The prefill phase in RAG is energy-intensive and time-consuming, prompting a need for efficiency.

Method: MatKV precomputes and materializes key-value vectors of RAG objects in flash storage, reuses them during inference, and allows capabilities like decoding text while loading materialized KVs into GPUs using low-end GPUs.

Result: Experimental results confirm that MatKV reduces inference time and power consumption by 50% without major accuracy loss in RAG workloads. Additional optimizations in latency and decoding hardware usage are demonstrated.

Conclusion: MatKV provides cost-effective and power-efficient LLM inference, making generative AI applications more accessible and scalable across diverse tasks and hardware.

Abstract: We observe two major trends in LLM-based generative AI: (1) inference is becoming the dominant factor in terms of cost and power consumption, surpassing training, and (2) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is becoming prevalent. When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programmability on GPUs remains a challenge for high-performance computations in open-source contexts, especially for efficiently accelerating computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Method: The study uses portable programming models and unified memory features to port OPENFOAM entirely onto GPUs. Performance is evaluated through numerical tests on LUMI and Leonardo clusters using advanced GPUs.

Result: Performance tests show strong scalability (65% efficiency on up to 8M cells/GPU), weak scalability (75-85% efficiency on 20 GPUs), and energy reduction of up to 82%. One A100 GPU matches the computing capability of 200-300 Intel cores under high workloads.

Conclusion: SPUMA significantly improves scalability, performance, and energy efficiency of CFD simulations using GPUs, demonstrating its suitability for hybrid HPC systems.

Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) on hybrid clusters represents a significant opportunity for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), especially when modern accelerators are utilized effectively. However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU). Finally, energy consumption is reduced by up to 82% compared to analogous simulations executed on CPUs.

Result: Analytical models demonstrate sub-second response times, scalability for large PMU deployments, and reliable operation with integrated security and privacy mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture serves as a robust solution for efficient, scalable, and secure PMU data processing in next-generation smart grids.

Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) generate high-frequency, time-synchronized data essential for real-time power grid monitoring, yet the growing scale of PMU deployments creates significant challenges in latency, scalability, and reliability.

This paper presents a scalable cloud-native architecture for intelligent PMU data processing that integrates artificial intelligence with edge and cloud computing. The proposed framework employs distributed stream processing, containerized microservices, and elastic resource orchestration to enable low-latency ingestion, real-time anomaly detection, and advanced analytics. Machine learning models for time-series analysis are incorporated to enhance grid observability and predictive capabilities. Analytical models are developed to evaluate system latency, throughput, and reliability, showing that the architecture can achieve sub-second response times while scaling to large PMU deployments. Security and privacy mechanisms are embedded to support deployment in critical infrastructure environments. The proposed approach provides a robust and flexible foundation for next-generation smart grid analytics.

*Rui Li,Zhaoning Zhang,Libo Zhang,Huaimin Wang,Xiang Fu,Zhiquan Lai*

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in speculative decoding (SD) for LLM inference, introducing "Nightjar"—an adaptive algorithm optimizing speculative lengths to improve throughput and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods fail to adapt to varying request loads, compromising efficiency and creating bottlenecks in real-world serving environments.

Method: The paper proposes a learning-based algorithm (Nightjar) that dynamically adjusts speculative length based on batch sizes and load, with the ability to disable SD when it provides no benefit.

Result: Nightjar achieves up to 14.8% higher throughput and 20.2% lower latency compared to traditional speculative decoding methods in LLM inference.

Conclusion: Nightjar significantly enhances efficiency and real-time capabilities of LLM inference by dynamically optimizing speculative decoding according to system demand.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates LLM inference by verifying draft tokens in parallel. However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Current SD implementations use a fixed speculative length, failing to adapt to dynamic request rates and creating a significant performance bottleneck in real-world serving scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RobustRL introduces a comprehensive fault-tolerant system for RL post-training, focusing on role-based fault isolation and efficient recovery, resulting in improved training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective fault-tolerant systems for RL post-training that can handle both training and inference workloads without entirely restarting processes.

Method: The system applies a three-step process: Detect (role-aware monitoring), Restart (non-disruptive recovery and isolated replacement for roles), and Reconnect (dynamic communication for weight synchronization).

Result: In tests on a 256-GPU cluster, RobustRL achieved an Effective Training Time Ratio (ETTR) of over 80%, far surpassing ByteRobust's 60%, with up to 17.4% faster training time.

Conclusion: RobustRL demonstrates that role-based fault isolation and efficient recovery practices significantly improve fault tolerance and performance in RL post-training at scale.

Abstract: RL post-training for LLMs has been widely scaled to enhance reasoning and tool-using capabilities. However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.
  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \textit{Reconnect}. We replace static collective communication with dynamic, UCX-based (Unified Communication X) point-to-point communication, enabling immediate weight synchronization between recovered roles. In an RL training task on a 256-GPU cluster with Qwen3-8B-Math workload under 10\% failure injection frequency, RobustRL can achieve an ETTR of over 80\% compared with the 60\% in ByteRobust and achieves 8.4\%-17.4\% faster in end-to-end training time.

*Pawissanutt Lertpongrujikorn*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) as a unified paradigm for cloud-native development, addressing fragmentation in serverless computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between serverless promises of simplified deployment and practical challenges of fragmentation in cloud computing tools.

Method: Empirical studies including interviews with developers (total of 161 stakeholders), along with prototypes such as Oparaca and EdgeWeaver to demonstrate OaaS capabilities.

Result: OaaS achieves improved scalability, declarative management of requirements, faster task completion, reduced coding complexity, and a commercialization pathway validated for SMEs/startups.

Conclusion: OaaS simplifies cloud infrastructure complexities, empowers innovation, and offers scalable solutions for cloud-native platforms.

Abstract: Cloud computing has fundamentally transformed application development, yet a gap remains between the serverless promise of simplified deployment and its practical realization due to fragmentation across function runtimes, state management, and orchestration. This dissertation addresses this gap through empirical validation and technical innovation, establishing the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) paradigm as a unified approach to cloud-native development. Grounded in evidence from three studies - practitioner interviews (21 participants), a human study on developer experience (39 participants), and NSF I-Corps customer discovery (101 interviews across 86 organizations) - this work demonstrates that infrastructure complexity taxes productivity, with practitioners prioritizing automation and maintainability over cost optimization. The dissertation makes five major contributions: (1) the OaaS paradigm unifies resource, state, and workflow management via the Oparaca prototype, demonstrating negligible overhead and state-of-the-art scalability; (2) SLA-driven OaaS enables declarative management of non-functional requirements like availability, consistency, and latency; (3) OaaS-IoT with EdgeWeaver extends the paradigm to the edge-cloud continuum, achieving 31% faster task completion and a 44.5% reduction in lines of code compared to traditional FaaS; (4) commercialization validation establishes a pathway targeting technology SMEs and startups; and (5) an empirical methodology for grounding technical research in validated practitioner needs. By consolidating fragmented abstractions and automating performance optimization, OaaS establishes a foundation for cloud-native platforms that hide infrastructure complexity and empower developers to focus on innovation.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces RollArc, a distributed system that optimizes training for agentic RL scenarios by maximizing hardware usage and reducing training time, using disaggregated infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in agentic RL training, caused by heterogeneous workloads and the challenges of using disaggregated infrastructure, including synchronization overhead and resource underutilization.

Method: RollArc employs three principles: hardware-affinity workload mapping to match tasks with the best-fit GPUs, fine-grained asynchrony to eliminate resource bottlenecks, and statefulness-aware computation to utilize serverless systems for scaling stateless tasks.

Result: RollArc demonstrated a 1.35-2.05x reduction in training time compared to traditional methods and showed scalability by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model on a 3,000-GPU Alibaba cluster.

Conclusion: RollArc proves effective in improving throughput, reducing training time, and ensuring scalability and robustness for agentic RL training on disaggregated infrastructures.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform autonomous decision-making and long-term planning. Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.
  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\(\times\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines. We also evaluate RollArc by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model for Qoder product on an Alibaba cluster with more than 3,000 GPUs, further demonstrating RollArc scalability and robustness.

*Mona Moghadampanah,Adib Rezaei Shahmirzadi,Farhana Amin,Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates energy inefficiencies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifying energy overheads and bottlenecks in their inference process while proposing optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the unexplored energy trade-offs and inefficiencies in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which incorporate additional modalities beyond text, increasing computational and energy demands.

Method: The study introduces a detailed stage-level energy consumption analysis of MLLM inference, including vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages, using four representative models on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. GPU power traces and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) are employed to assess inefficiencies and propose optimizations.

Result: Energy overheads for MLLMs compared to text-only LLMs range from 17% to 94%. The bottlenecks vary across architectures, originating from vision encoders or visual token sequence scaling. GPU underutilization during execution is identified, and input complexity impacts energy scaling behaviors.

Conclusion: The findings highlight inefficiencies in current MLLMs and suggest practical improvements, including stage-wise DVFS, to reduce energy consumption effectively while maintaining performance, guiding more energy-efficient system designs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are built on text-only LLMs by incorporating additional modalities, enabling multimodal understanding and a broader range of applications. However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact. Together, these findings offer practical insights and concrete guidance for designing more energy-efficient multimodal LLM serving systems.

*Ertza Warraich,Ali Imran,Annus Zulfiqar,Shay Vargaftik,Sonia Fahmy,Muhammad Shahbaz*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: OptiNIC is a domain-specific RDMA transport designed to address latency bottlenecks in distributed ML workloads by allowing best-effort transport and out-of-order delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address latency issues in distributed ML workloads that scale poorly due to strict reliability and delivery guarantees in existing RDMA systems.

Method: OptiNIC introduces a best-effort, out-of-order RDMA transport with adaptive timeouts for forward progress and delegates loss recovery to the ML pipeline using techniques like Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding.

Result: OptiNIC achieved 2x improvement in time-to-accuracy, 1.6x throughput increase, and significant reductions in latency, BRAM usage, and NIC faults across public cloud setups.

Conclusion: OptiNIC provides an efficient RDMA transport optimized for distributed ML workloads, improving performance significantly and addressing tail latency issues.

Abstract: As distributed machine learning (ML) workloads scale to thousands of GPUs connected by high-speed interconnects, tail latency in collective communication has become a major bottleneck. Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.
  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).
  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab). OptiNIC also lowers 99th-percentile latency by 3.5x, cuts BRAM usage by 2.7x, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults-delivering a resilient, tail-optimized RDMA transport purpose-built for distributed ML workloads.

*Panlong Wu,Yifei Zhong,Danyang Chen,Ting Wang,Fangxin Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Argus is a framework focusing on efficient task offloading for LLMs in dynamic, heterogeneous environments by incorporating token-length prediction and optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for LLM inference do not adequately address the variability in response generation time or the challenges imposed by heterogeneous edge-cloud systems with varying output token lengths.

Method: Argus introduces a Length-Aware Semantics module to predict token lengths and a Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization module with an Iterative Offloading Algorithm to optimize task distribution effectively.

Result: Argus demonstrates robust and efficient performance for LLM inference in experimental and theoretical evaluations in dynamic, heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: Argus offers a significant improvement in task offloading for distributed LLM inference by addressing variability and dynamic factors, ensuring better efficiency and quality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into real-world applications, yet their autoregressive architectures introduce significant inference time variability, especially when deployed across heterogeneous edge-cloud systems. Existing solutions largely neglect the dynamic, stochastic, and heterogeneous nature of such environments, often ignoring the impact of variable output token lengths and device diversity. In this work, we present Argus, the first token-aware distributed edge-cloud LLM inference framework that conducts efficient task offloading. Argus features a Length-Aware Semantics (LAS) module, which predicts output token lengths for incoming prompts using a fine-tuned language model with token-length-sensitive feature modulation, enabling precise estimation. Building on this, our Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization (LOO) module formulates long-term Quality-of-Experience optimization that explicitly considers both LLM prefilling and decoding costs. We introduce a novel Iterative Offloading Algorithm with Damping and Congestion Control (IODCC) to effectively solve the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem under time-varying constraints. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that Argus achieves robust performance and superior efficiency in highly dynamic, heterogeneous settings.

Motivation: Motivated by concerns about data privacy, operational sovereignty, and rising costs with cloud-based solutions.

Method: Benchmarks a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model on a consumer-grade server with an NVIDIA GPU.

Result: The on-premises setup achieved performance comparable to cloud services in terms of efficiency and reasoning capabilities, even under concurrent user loads.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that SMBs can deploy cost-effective and private large language models on emerging consumer hardware, mitigating privacy and cost issues.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by a reliance on cloud-based, proprietary systems, raising significant concerns regarding data privacy, operational sovereignty, and escalating costs. This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying a high-performance, private LLM inference server at a cost accessible to Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to scale Bitcoin as a universal Medium of Exchange (MoE) by addressing its throughput limitations.

Method: Bitcoin-IPC creates Layer-2 subnets using the Proof-of-Stake model linked to Bitcoin L1, leveraging SegWit for efficient communication and value transfer.

Result: Bitcoin-IPC achieves a 23x reduction in transaction costs and boosts monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps.

Conclusion: Bitcoin-IPC effectively scales Bitcoin by using Layer-2 PoS chains while maintaining settlement and security via Bitcoin L1.

Abstract: We introduce Bitcoin-IPC, a software stack and protocol that scales Bitcoin towards helping it become the universal Medium of Exchange (MoE) by enabling the permissionless creation of fully programmable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-2 chains, called subnets, whose stake is denominated in L1 BTC. Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security.
  Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of implementing structured, effective self-adaptation in microservices using control loops, ensuring consistency, planning, and modularity.

Method: The study examines architectural methods like the cloud-native Operator pattern and legacy techniques to integrate self-adaptive logic while evaluating their trade-offs.

Result: The authors analyze the balance between fine-grained adaptation and system-wide control, suggesting adaptability strategies can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture.

Conclusion: Combining diverse approaches offers a novel and modular solution for achieving self-adaptiveness in microservices like the TeaStore case study.

Abstract: The Adaptable TeaStore specification provides a microservice-based case study for implementing self-adaptation through a control loop.  We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met),  and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic).  In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.

TL;DR: KernelEvolve is a kernel coding framework designed to optimize deep learning recommendation model performance across heterogeneous hardware, automating kernel generation and enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware heterogeneity in training and inference for deep learning recommendation models (DLRM).

Method: KernelEvolve uses an agentic kernel framework to automate kernel generation and optimize recommendation models across diverse hardware. It employs graph-based search with selection policies and adapts dynamically using retrieval-augmented prompts.

Result: KernelEvolve achieved 100% correctness on the KernelBench suite and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across diverse hardware. It reduced kernel development time from weeks to hours and improved performance over PyTorch baselines.

Conclusion: KernelEvolve enhances performance efficiency in DLRM training and inference, significantly reduces development time, and simplifies the programmability for new AI hardware, making it highly effective for heterogeneous AI systems at scale.

Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.

*Yongyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pruning framework to improve Graph Neural Network (GNN) robustness by identifying and removing fragile elements in the graph based on adversarial robustness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are susceptible to perturbations and adversarial attacks in their graph structure and node features, which can compromise their performance.

Method: The framework utilizes robustness scores to selectively prune edges that degrade model reliability, thereby improving graph representation.

Result: The approach was tested on three GNN architectures and showed significant improvement in defense capability under high perturbations.

Conclusion: The pruning framework effectively enhances GNN robustness against adversarial attacks, yielding cleaner and more reliable graph representations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.

*Hans Jarett J. Ong,Brian Godwin S. Lim,Dominic Dayta,Renzo Roel P. Tan,Kazushi Ikeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCA, a new causal autoencoder model, operationalizes the Additive Noise Model (ANM) for unsupervised latent causal discovery, leveraging deterministic WAE and ANM Layer to improve identifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised representation learning currently struggles to capture causal dependencies due to identifiability challenges without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong biases.

Method: LANCA uses a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder combined with a differentiable ANM Layer, transforming residual independence into an optimization objective and employing ANM as an inductive bias.

Result: LANCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets like Pendulum, Flow, and CANDLE, showing improved robustness to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: LANCA contributes to latent causal discovery by operationalizing the ANM constraint effectively, addressing component-wise indeterminacy, and demonstrating superior empirical performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoliReward, a framework for improving video Reward Models (RMs) with high-quality data and advanced architectural designs, validated by benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in developing reward models for video generation, especially noisy data, insufficient architectural exploration, and reward hacking vulnerabilities.

Method: SoliReward gathers single-item binary annotations, uses a cross-prompt pairing strategy, employs a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism for feature aggregation, and modifies the BT loss to handle win-tie scenarios.

Result: The proposed framework showed improved RM evaluation metrics and enhanced efficacy of post-training alignment for video generation models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SoliReward enhances video RM development and addresses key limitations, improving both direct evaluation metrics and video generation alignment outcomes.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of video generation models with human preferences is a critical goal. Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples. Our approach is validated on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, demonstrating improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and in the efficacy of post-training on video generation models. Code and benchmark will be publicly available.

TL;DR: TIDES is a novel LLM-based framework designed for urban wireless traffic prediction, combining spatial-temporal features and efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction for intelligent resource management in next-generation wireless networks.

Method: TIDES integrates clustering for capturing regional traffic patterns, prompt engineering for numerical to language model adaptation, and a novel DeepSeek module for spatial alignment via cross-domain attention.

Result: TIDES outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy and robustness, based on extensive real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is critical for scalable, adaptive network management in future 6G systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness.

### [333] [Latent Sculpting for Zero-Shot Generalization: A Manifold Learning Approach to Out-of-Distribution Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22179)
*Rajeeb Thapa Chhetri,Zhixiong Chen,Saurab Thapa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents "Latent Sculpting," a two-stage deep learning method that addresses "Generalization Collapse" in high-dimensional tabular data, achieving strong results on detecting unseen anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised deep learning models perform poorly on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data due to lack of structural constraints in their latent space.

Method: The authors propose Latent Sculpting, a two-stage framework: 1) A hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer model trained with Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to create a dense, hyperspherical manifold, and 2) A Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) model trained on this structured manifold for density estimation.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed baselines on the CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, achieving 0.87 F1-Score on zero-shot anomaly detection and an 88.89% detection rate in critical scenarios.

Conclusion: Decoupling manifold structure learning from density estimation enhances generalization capabilities and offers a scalable solution for anomaly detection in complex data streams.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is "Generalization Collapse": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively "sculpt" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on "Infiltration" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.

*Vishnu Mohan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for tennis strategy optimization, achieving high win rates and efficiency but revealing a defensive bias in the learned policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of sequential decision-making in tennis strategy optimization, including hierarchical scoring, stochastic nature, long-term credit assignment, and opponent adaptation.

Method: A tennis simulation environment integrated with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) using curriculum learning to manage opponent difficulty over training.

Result: The trained RL agent achieved win rates of 98-100% against balanced opponents, good serve and return efficiencies, and maintained performance against harder opponents. Ablation studies confirmed the necessity of the dueling architecture and curriculum learning.

Conclusion: While the RL framework achieves strong performance, it demonstrates a defensive bias, underlining challenges in reward design for realistic sports simulations and indicating areas for methodological improvement.

Abstract: Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

*Jiahao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how regularization methods like L2 Regularization and Dropout affect the frequency bias in convolutional neural networks and introduces novel tools to quantify this impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding regarding how regularization techniques influence CNNs in terms of feature frequency selection and their spectral biases.

Method: The authors introduce the Visual Diagnostic Framework to track weight frequency dynamics and a new metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to measure low-pass filtering effects. They investigate the aliasing problem in small CNN kernels through discrete radial profiling and validate findings with ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10.

Result: L2 regularization significantly suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by more than three times compared to unregularized models. L2 models maintain better robustness (>6%) against image blurring but are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: Regularization imposes a spectral inductive bias favoring low-frequency structures, offering a deepened signal-processing perspective on generalization and robustness in CNNs.

Abstract: Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (Weight Decay) and Dropout are fundamental to training deep neural networks, yet their underlying physical mechanisms regarding feature frequency selection remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the "low-pass filtering" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean clinical and demographic data for longitudinal outcome prediction, especially in functional brain imaging studies.

Method: A novel GNN-TF model is introduced that integrates tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data using a graph neural network and a transformer-based temporal fusion approach. It leverages longitudinal resting-state fMRI data and temporal order for predictive modeling.

Result: The GNN-TF model demonstrates superior predictive performance in forecasting future tobacco usage compared to a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The GNN-TF model is an effective and comprehensive tool for integrating multimodal longitudinal data, making it valuable for clinical outcome prediction in functional brain imaging studies.

Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

### [339] [Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS): A Homeostatic Framework for Adaptive Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22200)
*Dhruv Tiwari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS) as a bio-inspired framework to enhance autonomy in AI agents, addressing limitations of traditional reward-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address fragility in AI agents operating in open-ended environments, where they struggle to explore, adapt to changes, and require extensive manual tuning.

Method: EILS replaces traditional heuristics with bio-inspired internal feedback modeled as continuous appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence to dynamically adjust optimization landscapes.

Result: The proposed framework hypothesizes that EILS agents can surpass standard baselines concerning sample efficiency and adaptability in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: EILS offers a unified and dynamic alternative to static reward functions, promising improved robustness and adaptability for AI agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this "extrinsic maximization" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.

### [340] [Transformer Reconstructed with Dynamic Value Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22212)
*Xiaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) approach, improving transformer efficiency by dynamically assigning values to queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a core limitation in transformers: the use of a static value for all queries within a head, which is inefficient and redundant.

Method: The proposed method dynamically assigns values to each query, removing the need for multiple heads and the feed-forward network, thereby simplifying the structure.

Result: Experiments show that the Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) reduces training time by 37.6% compared to the original transformer while boosting learning capability.

Conclusion: DVA offers a more efficient and effective transformer design, proving that a single-head approach can outperform the original multi-head attention system.

Abstract: Since transformer was firstly published in 2017, several works have been proposed to optimize it. However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.

### [341] [On the Existence and Behaviour of Secondary Attention Sinks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22213)
*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Louis Mahon,Wayne Luk,Anton Isopoussu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of attention sinks, particularly secondary sinks, in transformer models, characterizing their emergence, persistence, and impact on attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research identified primary attention sinks but lacked insight into secondary sinks, which appear under different conditions and impact the attention mechanisms at various layers.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments across 11 model families, analyze secondary sink formations, their properties, and impacts, and establish their link to specific middle-layer MLP modules.

Result: Secondary sinks are formed by middle-layer MLPs aligning vectors with primary sinks, exhibit consistent sink locations in large-scale models, and have variable persistence influencing attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Secondary attention sinks significantly impact model behavior, providing key insights into attention distribution mechanisms, especially in larger models, and uncovering structured sink levels that vary by model size.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

### [342] [Interpretable and Adaptive Node Classification on Heterophilic Graphs via Combinatorial Scoring and Hybrid Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22221)
*Soroush Vahidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for node classification using a combinatorial inference approach instead of deep message passing, offering robust performance on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural networks struggle with heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes belong to different classes, necessitating a better adaptive and interpretable method for classification.

Method: The authors designed a combinatorial inference framework with an additive scoring function integrating class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and label compatibility, with transparent hyperparameters to adapt between homophilic and heterophilic settings. It optionally integrates combinatorial predictions into a neural model for refinement.

Result: Their framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNNs on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks while being more interpretable, tunable, and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances interpretability and performance in heterophilic graph settings, maintaining efficient and leakage-free evaluation using training data.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a neural architecture for learning functions with singular or fractional power behavior, achieving significant improvements over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the limitations of traditional fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) in approximating singular or fractional power behaviors in functions, which commonly arise in physics applications.

Method: The method involves replacing fixed activations in neural networks with learnable fractional power bases, inspired by classical approximation theory, and proving its universal approximation capability using the Müntz-Szász theorem.

Result: MSN demonstrates superior approximation capabilities, achieving lower errors than traditional MLPs on singular function regression tasks and physics-informed applications, with learned exponents that align with the solution structure.

Conclusion: The results highlight the efficacy of theory-inspired architectural design for tackling challenging function approximation tasks, particularly in scientifically-driven contexts.

Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\{μ_k, λ_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.

Result: TabPFN outperformed other models in predicting mycotoxin levels. Weather history in the 90-day pre-harvest period and seed moisture content were identified as the most influential predictors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning, particularly with TabPFN, is effective in addressing multi-response tasks like mycotoxin prediction, potentially improving precision farming and food safety management.

Abstract: Mycotoxin contamination poses a significant risk to cereal crop quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity. Accurate prediction of mycotoxin levels can support early intervention strategies and reduce economic losses. This study investigates the use of neural networks and transfer learning models to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response prediction task. Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGAIN is a framework for accurate and transparent network traffic analysis leveraging traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional traffic analysis systems, which include high false positives, lack of trustworthiness, and poor interpretability, in modern heterogeneous network traffic.

Method: ReGAIN employs a three-step framework: summarizing traffic into natural-language summaries, embedding them in a vector database, and using a hierarchical retrieval pipeline with advanced filters, sampling, and re-ranking to ensure evidence-backed reasoning by LLMs.

Result: The system showed accuracy levels between 95.95% and 98.82% when analyzing ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traffic in a real-world dataset. Its performance surpassed traditional rule-based and machine learning systems, validated by dataset ground truths and expert assessment.

Conclusion: ReGAIN provides not only superior analytical performance but also clear explainability, outperforming conventional monitoring systems while ensuring trustworthy, evidence-based network traffic insights.

Abstract: Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates hyperparameter tuning impacts on training stability and proposes a unified parameterisation approach for scaling axes, enabling efficient transfer and optimisation of hyperparameters across varied model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for stabilizing training and boosting performance, particularly in large-scale models. Current transfer methods across model sizes need refinement, especially for scaling in various dimensions.

Method: The paper introduces Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation to unify scaling in width, depth, batch-size, and training duration. It explores per-module hyperparameter optimisation while solving empirical challenges with practical guidelines.

Result: Experiments show notable training speed improvements in Large Language Models by successfully transferring and optimising per-module hyperparameters.

Conclusion: With proper parameterisation methods, hyperparameter transfer and optimisation are achievable even in complex, high-dimensional setups, offering tangible benefits like faster training for modern models.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact training stability and final performance of large-scale models. Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.

Result: The DiRL-8B-Instruct model trained using this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematics among dLLMs and outperforms Qwen2.5 series models on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: By introducing DiRL and DiPO, the study provides an efficient post-training framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based language models, showcasing improved computational efficiency and task performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

*Omar Alsaqa,Linh Thi Hoang,Muhammed Fatih Balin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLISS is a sampling strategy for GNNs that dynamically selects important nodes for improved scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling GNNs to large graphs while overcoming computational and memory bottlenecks.

Method: BLISS uses multi-armed bandits to adaptively sample informative nodes for processing in GNN layers.

Result: BLISS achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-batch training while improving scalability.

Conclusion: BLISS offers a dynamic and versatile sampling strategy for GNNs, enhancing efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.

### [349] [Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22238)
*Byung-Kwan Lee,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Masters,' a framework to efficiently distill knowledge from large vision-language models into smaller ones using mask-progressive reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision-language models are highly effective but challenging to deploy on mobile or edge devices due to their size, necessitating compact models with capability.

Method: The method uses a mask-progressive reinforcement learning framework to distill knowledge. It masks less relevant teacher weights, gradually restoring them, and refines the process with offline reinforcement learning and dual rewards.

Result: The approach allows efficient distillation, enabling smaller models to learn rich representations and achieve high performance without excessive computational requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes limitations in knowledge distillation, allowing compact vision-language models to attain strong performance efficiently.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

### [350] [Causality-Inspired Safe Residual Correction for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22428)
*Jianxiang Xie,Yuncheng Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces CRC, a framework ensuring safe residual correction for multivariate forecasting models. It avoids degrading reliable predictions using a causality-inspired encoder and safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability of modern forecasting models like Transformers and GNNs by addressing systematic errors and ensuring predictions do not degrade during deployment.

Method: Proposes CRC, employing a causality-inspired encoder to separate self- and cross-variable dynamics and a hybrid corrector for residual errors, governed by a strict safety mechanism.

Result: CRC improves accuracy across various datasets and models, with high non-degradation rates supported by ablation studies.

Conclusion: CRC is a reliable correction framework that enhances forecasting accuracy without risking performance degradation, suited for safe deployment scenarios.

Abstract: While modern multivariate forecasters such as Transformers and GNNs achieve strong benchmark performance, they often suffer from systematic errors at specific variables or horizons and, critically, lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment. Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also "help in the wrong way" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.
  To address this critical "safety gap," we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.
  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.

### [351] [EvoXplain: When Machine Learning Models Agree on Predictions but Disagree on Why -- Measuring Mechanistic Multiplicity Across Training Runs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22240)
*Chama Bensmail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoXplain identifies variability in model explanations by examining their stability across repeated training, focusing on whether models share consistent explanatory mechanisms despite achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked question of whether models with high predictive accuracy rely on similar or diverging explanatory mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that assesses the stability of model explanations by treating them as samples from the stochastic optimization process. It evaluates if these explanations cluster into coherent groups or exhibit multimodality.

Result: Using the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets with Logistic Regression and Random Forests, the study reveals that high-accuracy models often produce explanations that are not stable and can show distinct explanatory modes.

Conclusion: EvoXplain does not aim to choose the best explanation but offers a way to visualize and quantify explanatory instability, highlighting the need to reframe interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated training rather than focusing on single models.

Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.

### [352] [The Bayesian Geometry of Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22471)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Bayesian wind tunnels," controlled environments to verify transformers' Bayesian reasoning rigorously, demonstrating their superiority over MLPs and explaining their inference mechanisms geometrically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously verify Bayesian reasoning in transformers, an aspect challenging to validate due to the complexity of natural data and the potential conflation of reasoning with memorization.

Method: The authors crafted "Bayesian wind tunnels," controlled environments with known posterior distributions and no possibility of memorization, to investigate Bayesian reasoning mechanisms in small transformers with geometric diagnostics.

Result: Small transformers reproduced Bayesian posteriors with high accuracy ($10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit), while capacity-matched MLPs failed significantly. They identified mechanisms like residual streams as belief substrates, feed-forward networks for posterior updates, and attention for routing information.

Conclusion: Transformers' hierarchical attention supports Bayesian inference through geometric design, affirming the necessity of attention mechanisms in contrast to flat architectures. The proposed framework links verifiable models to reasoning in larger language models.

Abstract: Transformers often appear to perform Bayesian reasoning in context, but verifying this rigorously has been impossible: natural data lack analytic posteriors, and large models conflate reasoning with memorization. We address this by constructing \emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.
  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \emph{frame-precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures. Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for mechanistically connecting small, verifiable systems to reasoning phenomena observed in large language models.

*Abdul Malik Al Mardhouf Al Saadi,Amrita Basak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a meta-learning framework for predicting bead geometry in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) processes, demonstrating high generalization and performance across various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of bead geometry in L-DED processes is challenging due to the scarcity and variability of experimental datasets across different materials and settings.

Method: A cross-dataset knowledge transfer approach is used through meta-learning, specifically leveraging the MAML and Reptile algorithms to adapt to new deposition conditions with minimal data.

Result: MAML and Reptile outperform conventional neural networks, achieving strong generalization and accurate bead height predictions with R-squared values up to 0.9 and mean absolute errors of 0.03-0.08 mm.

Conclusion: Meta-learning effectively transfers knowledge and enhances predictive accuracy in heterogeneous L-DED scenarios, enabling reliable performance even under limited data conditions.

Abstract: Accurate bead geometry prediction in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) is often hindered by the scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets collected under different materials, machine configurations, and process parameters. To address this challenge, a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model based on meta-learning for predicting deposited track geometry in L-DED is proposed. Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.

### [354] [On Admissible Rank-based Input Normalization Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22587)
*Taeyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores rank-based normalization and identifies structural weaknesses in existing methods, proposing new axioms for designing stable operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based normalization is widely used for its robustness, but lacks formal guarantees on stability under scaling or transformations.

Method: Introduced three axioms ensuring invariance/stability properties, derived structural criteria for valid operators, and empirically validated their proposed operator.

Result: Proved theoretical constraints for rank-based operators and demonstrated their practical relevance by constructing and testing a minimal valid operator.

Conclusion: The study formalizes stability properties for rank-based normalization, resolving limitations in existing methods and improving operator design.

Abstract: Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.
  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.
  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

*Shaurya Gaur,Michel Vitale,Alessa Hering,Johan Kwisthout,Colin Jacobs,Lena Philipp,Fennie van der Graaf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates potential biases in AI models for lung cancer risk estimation and finds performance disparities between demographic groups, highlighting the need for fairness-focused research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of performance disparities in existing AI lung cancer risk estimation models when applied across diverse demographic groups.

Method: Employed the JustEFAB framework to analyze fairness and evaluate AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for Sybil and Venkadesh21 models using US NLST data.

Result: Observed significant disparities in model performance by demographic groups, including lower AUROC in men and lower sensitivity for Black participants, beyond the influence of clinical confounders.

Conclusion: Identified unfair biases in lung cancer AI models, emphasizing the necessity of improving model fairness and monitoring performance across underrepresented groups.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

### [356] [Understanding the Mechanisms of Fast Hyperparameter Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22768)
*Nikhil Ghosh,Denny Wu,Alberto Bietti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores scale-aware hyperparameters to optimize deep learning models by enabling effective hyperparameter transfer across different scales, thereby reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard hyperparameter optimization for deep learning models is becoming computationally prohibitive as model sizes grow. Scale-aware hyperparameters could offer a solution by allowing hyperparameters optimized for small models to be effectively transferred to larger models.

Method: The paper presents a conceptual framework defining 'fast transfer' of hyperparameters, performs theoretical and empirical analyses of transfer strategies, and investigates the mechanisms behind effective hyperparameter transfer, particularly under the Maximal Update Parameterization (μP).

Result: The study formalizes that fast transfer is critical for compute-efficient grid search and empirically demonstrates that decomposing optimization trajectories can explain observed fast transfer. Synthetic experiments show mixed results based on problem structure, validating the hypothesis in practical and theoretical settings.

Conclusion: Fast hyperparameter transfer is computationally efficient and critically relies on problem structure. The decomposition of optimization trajectories provides an explanatory framework for understanding its success, and the study confirms this through empirical and theoretical investigations.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep learning models has rendered standard hyperparameter (HP) optimization prohibitively expensive. A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

*Bhaktipriya Radharapu,Eshika Saxena,Kenneth Li,Chenxi Whitehouse,Adina Williams,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for LLM-based judges that is computationally efficient, outperforming existing methods in calibration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the growing need to obtain calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently for LLM-based judges used in critical industry applications.

Method: The method involves training linear probes with a Brier score-based loss using reasoning judges' hidden states and avoiding additional model retraining.

Result: The results show that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing techniques, use approximately 10x less computational cost, and generalize well to unseen domains, though conservative estimates underperform on easier datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers an interpretable, scalable, and efficient uncertainty estimation solution for LLM judges, particularly beneficial for safety-focused applications.

Abstract: As LLM-based judges become integral to industry applications, obtaining well-calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently has become critical for production deployment. However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.

### [358] [The Affine Divergence: Aligning Activation Updates Beyond Normalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22247)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses mismatches in activation updates during gradient descent, offering new normalization insights and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the gap between idealized and actual activation updates during optimization, and provide a principled approach to normalization.

Method: Analyzes sample-wise scaling issues across layers and derives new normalization techniques, including "PatchNorm," grounded in first principles.

Result: New activation normalization approaches outperform conventional normalizers in various tests.

Conclusion: Presents theoretical and empirical advancements in activation optimization, proposing a reframe of normalization and novel mechanisms for model design.

Abstract: A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, "PatchNorm", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.

*Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the discrepancy between surrogate and target losses in machine learning, deriving bounds that guarantee strong performance metrics (H-consistency) and offering a comprehensive framework applicable to various scenarios including binary and multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in aligning surrogate loss functions with target performance loss in machine learning, which often arises due to computational or differentiability constraints.

Method: The paper derives H-consistency bounds for binary and multi-class classification tasks under different settings (e.g., adversarial, smooth surrogates). These bounds are analyzed for convex and comp-sum losses, extending a universal framework for guiding surrogate selection.

Result: Tight H-consistency bounds are established for both binary and multi-class classification. New insights into the feasibility of these bounds and the derivation of robust learning algorithms for adversarial settings are introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed H-consistency framework offers stronger performance guarantees and insights into surrogate selection, contributing to better alignment of surrogate and target losses in machine learning.

Abstract: In machine learning, the loss functions optimized during training often differ from the target loss that defines task performance due to computational intractability or lack of differentiability. We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.
  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.
  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.

TL;DR: A neural network is trained on synthetic rocket flight data from simulations to predict aerodynamic parameters for real flights, showing promising accuracy without real training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting rocket flight performance is challenging due to difficulties in measuring aerodynamic parameters and limitations of traditional or data-driven methods.

Method: A neural network is trained on 10,000 synthetic flight simulations, learning to predict drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from rocket data and apogee measurements.

Result: Achieved a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction on 8 real flights, outperforming baseline methods like OpenRocket.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows effective sim-to-real transfer for accurate and cost-efficient amateur rocket flight prediction, with publicly available implementation for broader use.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of model rocket flight performance requires estimating aerodynamic parameters that are difficult to measure directly. Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and adoption in the amateur rocketry community.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in large language models (LLMs) by proposing learning with multiple-expert deferral and abstention, offering new surrogate loss functions and strong consistency guarantees in classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle issues in LLMs like hallucinations and high inference costs, leveraging multiple expert systems can balance efficiency and reliability.

Method: The paper presents novel surrogate losses with provable guarantees for learning with abstention and multi-expert deferral in both classification and regression contexts, covering single-stage and two-stage strategies.

Result: New algorithms demonstrate superior performance on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. They also introduce a regression deferral framework, showing empirical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for leveraging multi-expert deferral and abstention, offering effective tools for addressing critical LLM challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face critical challenges: hallucinations and high inference costs. Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.
  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.
  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.
  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves unsupervised human motion segmentation using subspace clustering enhanced by temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from frames with large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods for human motion segmentation ignore temporal semantics, and this paper aims to enhance clustering by utilizing TVS derived from frames using LLM.

Method: The approach extracts TVS using LLM to evaluate motion continuity across frames, integrates it into subspace clustering with temporal regularizers, and applies feedback optimization for clustering results.

Result: The proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark human motion datasets, showing significant improvement in segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLM-derived temporal vision semantics improves subspace clustering for motion segmentation by introducing temporal constraints and feedback.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

*Pascal Passigan,Kevin zhu,Angelina Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework leveraging a heterogeneous graph and graph attention networks to predict gene expression changes caused by drugs, outperforming machine learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how drugs perturb gene expressions, surpassing the limitations of existing models focused on link prediction and binary drug-disease associations.

Method: The authors construct a merged biomedical graph integrating PrimeKG++ and LINCS L1000 nodes, employing multimodal embeddings and training a graph attention network (GAT) to predict delta expression profiles for landmark genes.

Result: The framework outperformed MLP baselines in predicting differential gene expression profiles and demonstrated the significance of edges provided by biomedical KGs through ablation experiments.

Conclusion: This study advances mechanistic drug modeling by shifting focus from binary drug-disease tasks to analyzing transcriptomic effects, enhancing drug intervention understanding.

Abstract: Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.

### [364] [Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23075)
*Yingru Li,Jiacai Liu,Jiawei Xu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces new bounds to address approximation errors in policy gradient methods for large language models, focusing on long-horizon tasks. It proposes a novel method called Trust Region Masking (TRM) to ensure guaranteed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods for large language models face challenges with surrogate objective approximation errors due to rollout policy divergence from true policies. Traditional bounds on these errors are ineffective for tasks with long sequences, necessitating tighter bounds and better solutions.

Method: The paper derives two new bounds (Pinsker-Marginal and Mixed) that scale better with sequence length, incorporating maximum token-level KL divergence as a key factor. It introduces Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes sequences violating the trust region during gradient computation.

Result: The proposed TRM method ensures non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees, particularly for long-horizon tasks, by addressing sequence-level approximation errors effectively.

Conclusion: This study provides tighter bounds on approximation errors and introduces TRM as a practical solution for controlling error in long-horizon reinforcement learning tasks involving large language models.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. When $π_{\text{roll}} \ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAATNet, which combines pre-training and fine-tuning for efficient and scalable link prediction using graph neural networks and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for link prediction struggle with large-scale sparse graphs and lack generalization in transfer learning across different datasets.

Method: The proposed GAATNet leverages distant neighbor embeddings in a self-attention module for capturing global features and uses a self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency.

Result: GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance on seven public datasets, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: GAATNet provides a robust and generalized solution for link prediction, effectively integrating graph neural networks and transfer learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought revolutionary advancements to the field of link prediction (LP), providing powerful tools for mining potential relationships in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks. This study provides a general and scalable solution for LP tasks to effectively integrate GNNs with transfer learning.

### [366] [Taming the Tail: Stable LLM Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23087)
*Yingru Li,Jiawei Xu,Jiacai Liu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Tianle Cai,Ge Zhang,Qian Liu,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses a mismatch in token probability distributions between inference and training in reinforcement learning for large language models, introducing a vocabulary pruning approach to resolve the mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the fundamental training-inference mismatch where inference engines and training systems produce differing token probabilities, destabilizing reinforcement learning for LLMs.

Method: The method involves dynamically pruning a "safe" vocabulary that excludes low-probability tokens (extreme tail), effectively trading bias from token mismatches for bounded optimization bias during reinforcement learning.

Result: The proposed pruning method achieves stable training and systematically reduces the gradient estimation issues caused by mismatched token probabilities.

Conclusion: The paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that vocabulary pruning can stabilize reinforcement learning for LLMs by mitigating mismatches without requiring post-hoc corrections. It bounds potential optimization bias introduced by this approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

*Daniil Burakov,Ivan Petrov,Dmitrii Khelimskii,Ivan Bessonov,Mikhail Lazarev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study developed a predictive model for cardiac death after PCI using real and synthetic patient data, improving minority-class prediction through data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the prediction of long-term mortality after PCI by addressing class imbalance and identifying key factors influencing cardiac death.

Method: Analyzed 2,044 real patients undergoing PCI, added 500 synthetic samples to address class imbalance, applied machine learning models, and evaluated feature importance through permutation methods and an additional experiment.

Result: Data augmentation enhanced minority-class recall and probability quality with minimal loss in AUROC. Features like Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease were critical.

Conclusion: Straightforward data augmentation can improve prediction performance and robustness in imbalanced clinical datasets, emphasizing the need for reporting probability quality and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Patient status, angiographic and procedural characteristics encode crucial signals for predicting long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.

*Paul M. Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines conditions under which generative and vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated predictions across sample inputs, critical in biomedicine. It provides finite-sample uniform convergence bounds and discusses their practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for uniformly accurate and well-calibrated model predictions in biomedical contexts, especially in rare conditions or specific subgroups, where overall metrics may miss critical errors.

Method: The authors study uniform generalization under structural assumptions in VLM classifiers. They derive finite-sample uniform convergence bounds under smooth dependence on low-dimensional representations using classical statistical tools.

Result: Finite-sample uniform convergence bounds have been established for accuracy and calibration functionals, varying with intrinsic dimensions. Spectrum-dependent bounds explain how eigenvalue decay governs sample requirements for reliability.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for biomedical modeling: current data sizes might suffice for uniform reliability in predictions, but average calibration metrics can overlook worst-case errors.

Abstract: Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.
  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.
  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.

### [369] [The Physics Constraint Paradox: When Removing Explicit Constraints Improves Physics-Informed Data for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22261)
*Rahul D Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of individual physics constraints in a grating coupler spectrum generator. It uncovers a paradox where explicit energy conservation enforcement is redundant, and highlights how Fabry-Perot oscillations affect bandwidth variability and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in physics-constrained data generation for machine learning, especially in domains with limited real data, and to identify which physical constraints are necessary rather than relying on over-constrained models.

Method: A systematic ablation study on a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to spectral responses. The study selectively removes specific physical constraints to evaluate their impact.

Result: Explicit energy conservation enforcement was found to be mathematically redundant, Fabry-Perot oscillations majorly influenced bandwidth variability, and conventional noise pipelines introduced small unphysical absorption values. High-throughput data generation at 200 samples per second was achieved, improving downstream machine learning predictions when specific constraints were removed.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of understanding and selectively applying physics constraints in data generation processes, improving machine learning accuracy and providing guidance for designing datasets in physics-informed domains.

Abstract: Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimization challenges of generalized metrics in class-imbalanced scenarios and proposes principled algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve evaluation metrics for class-imbalanced problems, overcoming existing computational and statistical limitations of current methods.

Method: Reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive problem and introduces a framework for designing $H$-consistent surrogate loss functions with finite-sample bounds.

Result: Proposes and implements METRO algorithms, showing theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness through experiments compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a robust and theoretically sound approach to optimizing generalized metrics in imbalanced data applications and outperform current baselines.

Abstract: In applications with significant class imbalance or asymmetric costs, metrics such as the $F_β$-measure, AM measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and weighted accuracy offer more suitable evaluation criteria than standard binary classification loss. However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees. We report the results of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods compared to prior baselines.

TL;DR: This paper presents Valori, a deterministic AI memory system using fixed-point arithmetic to enforce identical memory states and results across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems suffer from non-determinism due to floating-point arithmetic, challenging replayability and auditing in regulated environments.

Method: Valori utilizes fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) to establish deterministic memory as a replayable state machine, assuring uniformity in memory and search results.

Result: Non-determinism was shown to arise in memory operations before indexing, and Valori successfully guarantees deterministic memory outcomes across platforms.

Conclusion: Deterministic memory, as exemplified by Valori, is vital for enhancing trustworthiness and auditability in AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: PNNs present promising opportunities for accelerating machine learning by leveraging the unique benefits of photonic circuits. However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures. By addressing key computational bottlenecks, LuxIA facilitates broader adoption and accelerates innovation in AI hardware through photonic technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance the capability of LLMs in processing dynamic graphs and analyzing temporal motifs, which are crucial for understanding graph dynamics and anomalies.

Method: The authors propose LLMTM, a benchmark with six tasks across nine motif types. They evaluate nine LLMs with tailored prompting techniques and develop a tool-augmented LLM agent. A structure-aware dispatcher is also introduced to balance accuracy and cost.

Result: Experiment results show the effectiveness of the tool-augmented LLM agent in achieving high accuracy on temporal motif tasks, while the structure-aware dispatcher optimizes query distribution, reducing costs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs for analyzing temporal motifs in dynamic graphs, highlighting the benefit of integrating advanced tools and dispatchers for efficient and accurate processing.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical data-driven framework (SoDip) to address reproducibility issues in Radiation-Induced Grafting for polymer functionalization by accounting for variations in base film morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility limitations in Radiation-Induced Grafting (RIG) arise due to unreported variability in film morphology, affecting monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and leading to performance inconsistencies.

Method: The authors propose SoDip, a framework integrating text modeling (DeepSeek-R1), multimodal feature modeling (TabNet and XGBoost), Gaussian Process Regression with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models, and Bayesian Optimization to address synthesis challenges.

Result: SoDip demonstrated ~33% improvement in predictive performance over GPR during cross-validation, providing calibrated confidence intervals and identifying low-reproducibility zones.

Conclusion: This work establishes that data-driven frameworks like SoDip can mitigate challenges in reproducibility and enable morphology-aware design in RIG.

Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

*Yi-Han Wang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LightONS, a variant of the Online Newton Step algorithm, reducing computational costs while maintaining optimal regret bounds. It answers an open problem regarding stochastic eXp-concave optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiencies of Online Newton Step (ONS) in online and stochastic eXp-concave optimization scenarios, particularly focusing on runtime challenges posed by Mahalanobis projections.

Method: A variant algorithm, LightONS, employs domain-conversion techniques and a hysteresis mechanism to delay computationally expensive steps until necessary.

Result: LightONS reduces runtime significantly to $O(d^2 T + d^ω√(T log T))$ while maintaining optimal regret of $O(d log T)$, and achieves $	ilde{O}(d^3/ε)$ runtime for stochastic optimization, solving the COLT'13 open problem.

Conclusion: LightONS provides an efficient, practical replacement for ONS, retaining its optimal properties while offering broader applicability in adaptive regret, bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

Abstract: Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.
  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\sqrt{T \log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

*Nathan Buskulic,Luca Calatroni,Lorenzo Rosasco,Silvia Villa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines blind inverse problems using Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs), providing theoretical insights, practical equivalences, and numerical validations for learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind inverse problems are challenging as the forward operator is unknown, and current data-driven solutions, though effective, lack interpretability and theoretical guarantees, necessitating a more rigorous framework.

Method: The paper uses Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs) to analyze blind inverse problems, deriving theoretical results, finite-sample error bounds, and equivalences with Tikhonov-regularized formulations based on signal and noise distributions.

Result: The study provides closed-form solutions for optimal estimators, proves convergence under source conditions, derives error bounds that account for operator randomness, and confirms theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The research offers a rigorous theoretical framework for blind inverse problems using LMMSEs, emphasizing convergence, practical insights, and validation of learned estimators, enhancing both interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

*Guokan Chen,Yao Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced method called DBAW-PIKAN to overcome challenges in Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for multi-scale or high-frequency problems, achieving higher accuracy and convergence without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PINNs struggle with stiffness in gradient flow and spectral bias for complex scenarios like multi-scale or high-frequency problems, which limit their predictive power.

Method: Introduces the DBAW-PIKAN architecture combining Kolmogorov-Arnold network (using learnable B-splines) with a dynamic, adaptive weighting strategy to address PINN shortcomings.

Result: DBAW-PIKAN significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy by an order of magnitude in solving equations like Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz, compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: DBAW-PIKAN successfully enhances PINNs by mitigating gradient-related failures, offering superior accuracy and generalization in solving challenging numerical benchmarks.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant advancements in scientific computing by integrating fundamental physical principles with advanced data-driven techniques. However, when dealing with problems characterized by multi-scale or high-frequency features, PINNs encounter persistent and severe challenges related to stiffness in gradient flow and spectral bias, which significantly limit their predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN), designed to mitigate such gradient-related failure modes and overcome the bottlenecks in function representation. The core of DBAW-PIKAN combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture, based on learnable B-splines, with an adaptive weighting strategy that incorporates a dynamic decay upper bound. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. A series of numerical benchmarks, including the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations, demonstrate the significant advantages of DBAW-PIKAN in enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance.

*Zikun Guoa,Adeyinka. P. Adedigbaa,Rammohan Mallipeddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new GAN-based method to generate synthetic appliance data for load monitoring, improving model efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the scarcity of labeled datasets for non-intrusive load monitoring, while addressing existing GAN-based method limitations.

Method: A hybrid GAN framework that uses clustering for intermittent appliances and LSTM-based generators for continuous appliances.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods in realism, diversity, and training stability, as demonstrated on the UVIC dataset.

Conclusion: The Cluster Aggregated GAN improves synthetic load generation for energy research by being interpretable, stable, and scalable.

Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.

*Renping Zhou,Zanlin Ni,Tianyi Chen,Zeyu Liu,Yang Yue,Yulin Wang,Yuxuan Wang,Jingshu Liu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses a discrepancy between training and inference in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), introducing Co-GRPO to optimize both stages holistically, resulting in better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the mismatch between the simplified training procedure of MDMs and their more complex inference process governed by token decoding schedules, which limits optimization and quality during inference.

Method: The paper introduces Co-GRPO, a reformulation of MDM generation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), optimizing both model and inference schedules cooperatively using Group Relative Policy Optimization without backpropagation through multi-step processes.

Result: Co-GRPO improves the alignment between training and inference and achieves substantial enhancements in generation quality across four benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench).

Conclusion: The approach bridges a critical gap between training and inference in MDMs, showcasing better alignment and improved capabilities in vision, language, and cross-modal generation tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [380] [ML Compass: Navigating Capability, Cost, and Compliance Trade-offs in AI Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23487)
*Vassilis Digalakis,Ramayya Krishnan,Gonzalo Martin Fernandez,Agni Orfanoudaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ML Compass, a framework for AI model selection considering utility, costs, and compliance, showing it often differs from capability-only rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between AI model leaderboard capabilities and real-world deployment decisions, influenced by costs, application outcomes, and compliance requirements.

Method: The paper proposes ML Compass, a system-level multi-step approach for selecting models that includes: extracting internal measures, estimating frontiers, learning task-specific utility functions, and making recommendations based on trade-offs.

Result: Validation via two case studies (general conversational and healthcare settings) demonstrates that ML Compass generates deployment-aware model rankings that differ from capability-focused ones, better optimizing for given constraints.

Conclusion: Model selection needs to consider deployment constraints beyond raw capability, and ML Compass highlights trade-offs and shapes better-informed decision-making for real-world AI applications.

Abstract: We study how organizations should select among competing AI models when user utility, deployment costs, and compliance requirements jointly matter. Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a distributed self-supervised learning approach that extracts latent knowledge from interdependent data without raw data sharing, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unlock hidden relationships and latent structures in distributed interdependent data sources without the need for centralized data exchange.

Method: The method involves a self-supervised learning paradigm called Osmotic Learning, which synthesizes compact data representations through a process inspired by osmosis and enables decentralized clustering of correlated data groups.

Result: The results demonstrate that OSM-L achieves over 0.99 accuracy in aligning local data representations while preserving the contextual integrity of structured datasets.

Conclusion: OSM-L successfully uncovers contextual patterns in distributed data through information diffusion and alignment, highlighting its potential for decentralized applications that prioritize data privacy.

Abstract: Data within a specific context gains deeper significance beyond its isolated interpretation. In distributed systems, interdependent data sources reveal hidden relationships and latent structures, representing valuable information for many applications. This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm designed to uncover higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data. The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism. Experimental results confirm OSM-L's convergence and representation capabilities on structured datasets, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity.

*Arunkumar V,Nivethitha S,Sharan Srinivas,Gangadharan G. R*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of algorithmic managerial oversight on gig workers' performance and wellbeing. Nonlinear patterns emerge in worker responses based on transparency of oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether person-centered management principles can thrive in algorithm-driven work environments and explore gig worker responses to algorithmic oversight.

Method: Authors applied a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model using survey data from 464 gig workers, capturing non-linear effects.

Result: Supportive HR practices enhance worker wellbeing. Algorithmic oversight induces nonmonotonic outcomes where unclear rules weaken performance, but transparent oversight improves control effectiveness.

Conclusion: Transparency and clear rules make algorithmic oversight more effective; the study provides practical design insights for platforms and advances methodological approaches.

Abstract: A central question for the future of work is whether person centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles. Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the foundational problem of distribution shifts, which limits the reliability, general usability, and societal trust in ML systems, even as AI models surpass human capability in specific domains.

Method: The study categorizes distribution shifts into perturbation, domain, and modality shifts, and addresses solutions by focusing on improving robustness, explainability, and adaptability for these scenarios.

Result: The findings offer insights and solutions aimed at enhancing the robustness, versatility, and responsibility of ML systems, focusing on critical aspects like efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

Conclusion: The work contributes by proposing solutions for trustworthy ML under distribution shifts, ensuring these systems are reliable, versatile, and socially dependable.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been a foundational topic in artificial intelligence (AI), providing both theoretical groundwork and practical tools for its exciting advancements. From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

*Zihao Zhou,Shusen Yang,Fangyuan Zhao,Xuebin Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses unfairness in graph federated learning caused by imbalanced overlapping subgraphs across clients and proposes a novel algorithm, FairGFL, to enhance fairness and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of fairness in graph federated learning with imbalanced overlapping data among clients, a concern largely unexplored despite its potential to harm equitable outcomes.

Method: The authors propose FairGFL, which uses a weighted aggregation approach for fairness, privacy-preserving estimation of overlapping ratios, and a regularizer integrated into the federated loss function to improve fairness and utility tradeoff.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark graph datasets show that FairGFL outperforms baseline algorithms in both fairness and model utility.

Conclusion: FairGFL effectively addresses fairness issues in graph federated learning while maintaining high model performance, demonstrating significant improvements over previous methods.

Abstract: Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.

*Qingyue Cao,Bo Jin,Changwei Gong,Xin Tong,Wenzheng Li,Xiaodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN) for graph anomaly detection, addressing challenges in handling heterogeneous graph data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection techniques struggle with disguised anomalies in heterogeneous graph data, leading to issues such as over-smoothing and lack of adaptivity.

Method: The MHSA-GNN dynamically generates instance-specific filters using a hypernetwork that relies on spectral fingerprints. It incorporates a dual regularization strategy, combining teacher-student contrastive learning and Barlow Twins diversity loss to enhance robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets reveal that MHSA-GNN preserves high-frequency signals and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective at detecting graph anomalies, offering adaptability and robustness even in challenging heterogeneous scenarios.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection technology has broad applications in financial fraud and risk control. However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Splitwise, a novel framework for fine-grained adaptive partitioning of large language models (LLMs) across edge and cloud environments to enhance latency, energy efficiency, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power, and previous solutions such as static partitions or cloud-only inference have significant limitations under bandwidth fluctuations or cost considerations.

Method: The authors propose a Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for adaptive partitioning. Instead of partitioning entire layers, Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into finer structures and uses hierarchical DRL policies with Lyapunov optimization to minimize latency, energy, and accuracy degradation. Partition checkpoints are also used to ensure robustness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Splitwise significantly reduces latency (1.4x-2.8x) and energy consumption (up to 41%) compared to existing methods, while also lowering the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, all without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Splitwise provides a robust and efficient solution for deploying LLMs across edge and cloud systems, addressing challenges like fluctuating bandwidth and resource constraints, making it a practical choice for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.

*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models ignore warnings in training data, reproducing warned-against behavior at high rates. The root cause lies in overlapping feature activations for describing and performing the behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand why warning-framed data does not prevent language models from reproducing harmful behavior and to explore potential solutions.

Method: The authors used sparse autoencoder analysis to investigate overlaps in latent feature activations for warning and exploitation contexts. Experimental comparisons and feature ablation were conducted to isolate effects.

Result: Models exposed to warnings reproduced flagged content (76.7% rate), comparable to when content was given directly (83.3%). Key latent features showed similar activation patterns across contexts.

Conclusion: Current models prioritize statistical co-occurrence over contextual meaning, limiting their ability to interpret and act on warnings. Training-time adjustments may address this limitation.

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

### [388] [Le Cam Distortion: A Decision-Theoretic Framework for Robust Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23617)
*Deniz Akdemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies the limitations of traditional Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods due to their approach of forcing feature invariance, which can cause negative transfer. Instead, the authors propose a decision-theoretic framework using Le Cam's theory to enable risk-controlled transfer without source degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of distribution shift in real-world machine learning, where traditional UDA approaches may fail, leading to catastrophic outcomes in safety-critical applications due to information destruction.

Method: The proposed method leverages Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments to replace symmetric feature invariance with directional simulability. It introduces Le Cam Distortion, based on the Deficiency Distance metric, as a measure to bound transfer risk while preserving simulability.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed existing approaches across multiple experiments: achieving near-perfect frequency estimation in genomics, maintaining source utility in image classification, and enabling safe policy transfer in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Le Cam Distortion offers a rigorous, risk-controlled approach for transfer learning, particularly suited for domains demanding high reliability, such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture and shows its advantages in addressing issues like expert imbalance and computational constraints in traditional MoE setups using quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve limitations in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as expert imbalance and inefficiencies in routing mechanisms, leveraging Quantum Machine Learning capabilities.

Method: Ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) with classical experts. Quantum Router utilizes quantum feature maps and wave interference for efficient high-dimensional decision-making.

Result: The Quantum Router outperforms classical routers on complex datasets (e.g., Two Moons) by effectively untangling non-linear separable data and achieves better parameter efficiency. It is also robust to simulated quantum noise.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced routers offer significant advantages for complex decision boundaries, showing potential for NISQ hardware applications in privacy-preserving and adaptive systems.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling deep learning models, yet it is fundamentally limited by challenges such as expert imbalance and the computational complexity of classical routing mechanisms. This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively "untangling" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for targeted interventions, improving the safety of the US 158 corridor, and demonstrate the utility of advanced modeling techniques in rural highway safety analysis.

Abstract: This study extends previous hotspot and Chi-Square analysis by Sawyer \cite{sawyer2025hotspot} by integrating advanced statistical analysis, machine learning, and spatial modeling techniques to analyze five years (2019--2023) of traffic accident data from an 8.4-mile stretch of US 158 in Currituck County, NC. Building upon foundational statistical work, we apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), Negative Binomial Regression, Random Forest classification, and Highway Safety Manual (HSM) Safety Performance Function (SPF) comparisons to identify comprehensive temporal and spatial crash patterns. A Random Forest classifier predicts injury severity with 67\% accuracy, outperforming HSM SPF. Spatial clustering is confirmed via Moran's I test ($I = 0.32$, $p < 0.001$), and KDE analysis reveals hotspots near major intersections, validating and extending earlier hotspot identification methods. These results support targeted interventions to improve traffic safety on this vital transportation corridor. Our objective is to provide actionable insights for improving safety on US 158 while contributing to the broader understanding of rural highway safety analysis through methodological advancement beyond basic statistical techniques.

*Francesco Piatti,Thomas Cass,William F. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining random features and controlled differential equations (CDEs) for time-series learning, resulting in fast and efficient models with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a training-efficient and scalable approach for learning time-series data by leveraging random features and continuous-time modeling with CDEs.

Method: The framework uses large randomly parameterized CDEs coupled with a trainable linear readout layer. Two variants, RF-CDEs and R-RDEs, respectively apply random Fourier features and log-signatures to enhance temporal interactions.

Result: Both models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art results across various time-series benchmarks, validating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach offers an efficient alternative to explicit signature computations, providing strong inductive biases with the efficiency of random features.

Abstract: We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.
  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.

*Sultan Amed,Chan Yu Hang,Sayantan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes PDx, an MLOps-driven decision system for credit risk forecasting using dynamic model lifecycle management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many credit risk models lack the ability to adapt to changing borrower behavior, leading to performance degradation and difficulties in transitioning ML models to production environments.

Method: PDx uses an MLOps pipeline for continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation via a champion-challenger framework for dynamic model updates.

Result: Empirical analysis reveals decision tree-based models outperform others but need frequent updates, while linear models and neural networks degrade faster. Effectiveness validated with datasets from various lending contexts.

Conclusion: PDx mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, ensuring adaptability and scalability for credit risk forecasting in rapidly changing environments.

Abstract: This paper presents PDx, an adaptive, machine learning operations (MLOps) driven decision system for forecasting credit risk using probability of default (PD) modeling in digital lending. While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMBoost is a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework leveraging intermediate states of LLMs to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance ensemble learning of LLMs by utilizing intermediate states, addressing limitations of black-box approaches.

Method: Introduces cross-model attention, progressive chain training, and near-parallel inference mechanisms for boosting.

Result: Achieves consistent accuracy improvements and reduced inference latency on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LLMBoost effectively improves LLM ensemble performance by leveraging internal states, enabling hierarchical knowledge transfer and efficiency.

Abstract: Ensemble learning of LLMs has emerged as a promising alternative to enhance performance, but existing approaches typically treat models as black boxes, combining the inputs or final outputs while overlooking the rich internal representations and interactions across models.In this work, we introduce LLMBoost, a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework that breaks this barrier by explicitly leveraging intermediate states of LLMs. Inspired by the boosting paradigm, LLMBoost incorporates three key innovations. First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.

### [394] [Optimistic Feasible Search for Closed-Loop Fair Threshold Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22313)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses closed-loop decision-making under fairness constraints with feedback effects. It introduces the Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS) algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness using benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fair decision-making systems often face challenges from feedback effects, leading to non-stationary data and potential disparities. Addressing these issues in a constrained setting is crucial.

Method: The study proposes OFS, a grid-based algorithm utilizing confidence bounds to select thresholds under fairness and service constraints in a closed-loop system.

Result: OFS outperforms baseline methods in achieving higher rewards and smaller constraint violations using synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, including German Credit and COMPAS data.

Conclusion: OFS proves to be an effective and interpretable solution for learning feasible threshold policies while adhering to fairness constraints in closed-loop environments.

Abstract: Closed-loop decision-making systems (e.g., lending, screening, or recidivism risk assessment) often operate under fairness and service constraints while inducing feedback effects: decisions change who appears in the future, yielding non-stationary data and potentially amplifying disparities. We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.
  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.
  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LangPrecip introduces a language-aware multimodal approach to enhance short-term precipitation nowcasting by integrating textual and radar data, achieving significant improvements in forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of uncertain spatiotemporal forecasting in short-term precipitation nowcasting, particularly for extreme weather events, where existing methods relying heavily on visual conditioning fail to constrain motion adequately.

Method: The authors propose LangPrecip, a framework that integrates meteorological text as semantic motion constraints in a Rectified Flow paradigm, coupling textual and radar information effectively in latent space. They also develop a dataset, LangPrecip-160k, with paired radar sequences and motion descriptions.

Result: Experiments on Swedish and MRMS datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in forecasting accuracy, including a 60% and 19% gain in heavy-rainfall CSI at an 80-minute prediction lead time.

Conclusion: The integration of linguistic data as spatiotemporal constraints enhances precipitation nowcasting models, addressing motion ambiguity and improving accuracy for extreme weather events.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events. Existing generative approaches rely primarily on visual conditioning, leaving future motion weakly constrained and ambiguous. We propose a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework(LangPrecip) that treats meteorological text as a semantic motion constraint on precipitation evolution. By formulating nowcasting as a semantically constrained trajectory generation problem under the Rectified Flow paradigm, our method enables efficient and physically consistent integration of textual and radar information in latent space.We further introduce LangPrecip-160k, a large-scale multimodal dataset with 160k paired radar sequences and motion descriptions. Experiments on Swedish and MRMS datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 60 \% and 19\% gains in heavy-rainfall CSI at an 80-minute lead time.

### [396] [Decomposing Uncertainty in Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Why Entity Variance Is Not Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22318)
*Chorok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation in probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings related to relation-agnostic uncertainty, introduces a theoretical decomposition of uncertainty, and proposes a method (CAGP) combining complementary uncertainty signals to significantly improve out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing knowledge graph embeddings that provide relation-agnostic uncertainty estimates, which fail on novel relational contexts and lead to suboptimal performance in out-of-distribution detection.

Method: The authors formalize uncertainty decomposition into semantic uncertainty (from entity embedding variance) and structural uncertainty (from entity-relation co-occurrence) and propose a new method, CAGP, that combines these signals with learned weights.

Result: CAGP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection and reduces errors by 43% on selective prediction tasks. Empirical validation confirms its robustness across three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10).

Conclusion: Incorporating both semantic and structural uncertainty signals significantly outperforms relation-agnostic methods and resolves key limitations in existing probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings, offering a robust approach to out-of-distribution challenges.

Abstract: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

*Sravan Karthick T*

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel method, integrating macroeconomic data (Global M2 Liquidity) with the TimeXer model, achieving significant improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in Bitcoin price forecasting caused by extreme volatility and the limitations of traditional models. Exploring the integration of global liquidity data aims to improve predictive performance.

Method: The paper employs the TimeXer-Exog model, which incorporates Global M2 Liquidity as an exogenous variable with a 12-week lag, comparing it with LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and univariate TimeXer models.

Result: The proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves superior results with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.08e8 for a 70-day forecast, outperforming the baseline TimeXer by over 89%.

Conclusion: Incorporating global liquidity as an exogenous variable in deep learning models significantly enhances the stability and accuracy of long-term Bitcoin price forecasting.

Abstract: Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights how LoRA-based fine-tuning can degrade model capabilities and proposes a simple training tweak to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the negative effects of LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning on model capabilities despite being small-scale, and provide a solution.

Method: Introduce a regularized approximate replay approach that penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves pretraining-like data during training.

Result: The proposed approach maintains general knowledge while allowing adaptability to new tasks when applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: The suggested training modifications effectively prevent performance degradation while preserving model flexibility, with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, only modify a small subset of parameters, they can have a significant impact on the model. Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.

*Jiacheng Li,Jianchao Tan,Zhidong Yang,Feiye Huo,Yerui Sun,Yuchen Xie,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFA-LoRA enhances LoRA's expressive power by introducing non-linear transformations during training, enabling better parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA’s limitation lies in its reliance on linear adaptation, which restricts its expressive power and creates a gap compared to non-linear training. The motivation is to bridge this gap while maintaining the efficiency of LoRA.

Method: The paper introduces AFA-LoRA, which uses an annealed activation function that starts as non-linear and transitions to linear during training. This approach enhances representational power but maintains mergeability.

Result: The proposed AFA-LoRA method improves performance compared to LoRA and narrows the gap with full-parameter training in various tasks such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding.

Conclusion: AFA-LoRA enables non-linear expressivity in LoRA, enhancing its performance and practicality without losing its core benefits of efficiency and mergeability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflict between achieving high prediction accuracy and maintaining interpretability in OD flow prediction for GIS and urban analytics applications.

Method: AMBIT integrates classical physical mobility models like PPML gravity with gradient-boosted tree models as residual learners, leveraging SHAP analysis for interpretability. The framework is tested on NYC taxi OD data and includes diagnostics and error analysis.

Result: AMBIT approaches the accuracy of strong tree-based models while preserving interpretability. POI-anchored residuals improve robustness under spatial generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: AMBIT effectively balances accuracy and interpretability in OD flow prediction by augmenting physical models with tree-based residuals, aiding urban decision-making processes.

Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) flow prediction remains a core task in GIS and urban analytics, yet practical deployments face two conflicting needs: high accuracy and clear interpretability. This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization. We provide a reproducible pipeline, rich diagnostics, and spatial error analysis designed for urban decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLUE, a gradient-free method to unify pretrained specialist models into a generalized model suitable for new domains. It outperforms heuristic methods and matches or exceeds gradient-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing initialization methods for blending pretrained expert models rely on heuristics or computationally expensive backpropagation, which often leads to lower accuracy or inefficiencies.

Method: GLUE uses a gradient-free technique (SPSA) to determine the mixture coefficients for combining fixed experts, requiring only two forward passes per step.

Result: GLUE achieves up to 8.5% better accuracy than data-size weighting and 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. It matches or surpasses full-gradient methods within a 1.4% margin.

Conclusion: GLUE provides an efficient, accurate alternative to heuristic or full-gradient methods for initializing generalized models in new domains.

Abstract: In many deployed systems (multilingual ASR, cross-hospital imaging, region-specific perception), multiple pretrained specialist models coexist. Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.

Motivation: Address the performance limitations in dealing with class imbalance in multiclass classification by exploring collaborative optimization between imbalanced learning and model training.

Method: Designs a Boosting model incorporating a density factor, confidence factor, noise-resistant weight update mechanism, and a dynamic sampling strategy to achieve integrated optimization.

Result: Extensive tests on 20 public datasets show superior performance over eight current baseline models.

Conclusion: This model effectively bridges the gap between imbalanced learning and model training, advancing classification capabilities in imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Numerous studies attempt to mitigate classification bias caused by class imbalance. However, existing studies have yet to explore the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. This constraint hinders further performance improvements. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines. The code for the proposed model is available at: https://github.com/ChuantaoLi/DARG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable IoT threat detection framework addressing concept drift without frequent retraining, using latent-space alignment and graph neural network classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for IoT threat detection struggle with dynamic real-world traffic (concept drift) and require costly periodic retraining, which risks catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Train a classifier on latent-space representations of historical traffic and use an alignment model to map incoming data to this latent space before classification using graph neural networks.

Result: Experimental results on real-world IoT traffic datasets show robust detection performance under concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for deployment in dynamic IoT settings, enabling efficient and scalable threat detection while overcoming existing retraining challenges.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It proposes Partial-LoRA, a method that trains efficient sparse low-rank adapters, and demonstrates significant parameter reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH)—originally meant for over-parameterized neural networks—applies to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), especially given the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models.

Method: The authors analyze the presence of sparse subnetworks within LoRA that match dense adapter performance, and propose a novel method called Partial-LoRA. Partial-LoRA identifies and systematically trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces in the pretrained model.

Result: Experiments conducted on 8 vision tasks and 12 language tasks show that Partial-LoRA reduces trainable parameters by up to 87% while either maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: The study broadens the understanding of transfer learning, demonstrating that sparse subnetworks can achieve competitive performance in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation techniques for large pretrained models.

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse subnetworks ("winning tickets") capable of matching full model performance when trained from scratch. With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.

Result: The metadata-based approach improved accuracy by up to 7.14% and achieved a precision of 83.12%, while revealing that metadata signals alone are unreliable predictors of hallucinations. Prompting strategies were found to influence model behaviors but not overall accuracy.

Conclusion: While metadata-based correctness prediction shows promise, the explored methods are insufficiently robust for deployment in critical high-stakes scenarios, warranting further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and medical education, where the risk of generating factually incorrect (i.e., hallucinated) information is a major concern. While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.

*Hamed Damirchi,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Zhen Zhang,Javen Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for decomposing task vectors, separating shared and unique components, to improve precision in model behavior manipulation without unintended effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in adapting large pre-trained models to specific behaviors efficiently while avoiding interference between overlapping concepts during task vector manipulations.

Method: The authors propose decomposing task vectors into shared and unique components using invariant subspace identification across projections.

Result: The method improves multi-task merging in image classification, enhances style mixing in diffusion models, and reduces toxicity in language models effectively by leveraging the decomposed components.

Conclusion: Decomposing task vectors provides a principled framework to address limitations in model editing, allowing for more accurate and controlled manipulation of pre-trained model behaviors.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have transformed machine learning, yet adapting these models effectively to exhibit precise, concept-specific behaviors remains a significant challenge. Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.

### [407] [Towards Reliable Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22522)
*Jihang Wang,Dongcheng Zhao,Ruolin Chen,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in evaluating the adversarial robustness of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to vanishing gradients. The authors propose a novel framework and demonstrate its effectiveness with improved attack success under adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to accurately evaluate the adversarial robustness of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as current methods are prone to vanishing gradients and may overestimate robustness, leaving SNNs vulnerable.

Method: The authors propose the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG) for more accurate gradient estimation and Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD) for stable attacks under imprecise gradients. The ASSG adapts based on input distribution during attacks, and SA-PGD employs adaptive step sizes.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve attack success rates across various SNN architectures and adversarial training schemes, revealing overestimated robustness in current SNNs.

Conclusion: The research highlights the need for better adversarial training methods and presents a reliable framework to evaluate and improve SNN adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) utilize spike-based activations to mimic the brain's energy-efficient information processing. However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.

*Jaebin Lee,Hankook Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder framework for time-series forecasting addressing extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation tasks via a generalized architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the traditional focus on encoder design in time-series forecasting and address the uncoupled treatment of prediction and training through a holistic modeling approach.

Method: The approach involves a novel encoder-decoder architecture with latent bottleneck representations for encoding temporal dependencies and learnable queries for decoding relevant target information.

Result: TimePerceiver outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing its superiority in time-series forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: TimePerceiver's flexible, alignment-oriented design allows it to handle diverse forecasting objectives effectively, setting a new standard for unified forecasting frameworks.

Abstract: In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns of AVs in mixed traffic, with a focus on uncovering crash patterns across SAE Levels of automation.

Method: The study utilized a two-stage data mining framework comprising K-means clustering for crash segmentation and Association Rule Mining to identify relationships between crash factors.

Result: Four behavioral crash clusters were identified with detailed multivariate relationships between crash conditions uncovered using ARM.

Conclusion: Insights from this analysis inform AV developers and policymakers on enhancing safety measures and deployment strategies for Automated Vehicles.

Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AV) hold potential to reduce or eliminate human driving errors, enhance traffic safety, and support sustainable mobility. Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.

*Guikun Xu,Xiaohan Yi,Peilin Zhao,Yatao Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnFlow integrates flow matching with an energy model to improve low-energy conformer generation and ground-state identification, achieving superior performance over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in generating low-energy conformers and accurately identifying ground-state conformations, which are computationally expensive with traditional physics-based pipelines and fragmentary in learning-based methods.

Method: EnFlow combines flow matching with an energy-guided sampling strategy, explicitly learning an energy model and steering sampling toward low-energy regions via energy-gradient guidance.

Result: EnFlow improves metrics for conformer generation in few steps and reduces errors in ground-state predictions compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as validated on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed EnFlow method effectively unifies conformer generation and ground-state identification, showing high efficiency and accuracy across tested benchmarks.

Abstract: Generating low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground-state conformations from molecular graphs remain computationally demanding with physics-based pipelines. Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The PGRU model provides more accurate and efficient cryptocurrency price forecasting while requiring fewer inputs and less computational cost.

Abstract: According to the advent of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, many investments and businesses are now conducted online through cryptocurrencies. Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of forecasting the complex gold market due to its interrelation with economic and political components.

Method: An AI-based algorithm using two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for daily/monthly gold forecasts, integrated into a Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) network; optimized with Gray Wolf Optimization based on RMSE.

Result: The model achieved 171% return in live trading over three months and accurate predictions with MAE of $0.21 (daily) and $22.23 (monthly).

Conclusion: The proposed AI algorithm significantly improves gold price prediction and demonstrates promising application in financial forecasting and trading strategies.

Abstract: The global gold market, by its fundamentals, has long been home to many financial institutions, banks, governments, funds, and micro-investors. Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.

*Tomas Ortega,Chun-Yin Huang,Xiaoxiao Li,Hamid Jafarkhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the communication bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL) by introducing two novel frameworks, CAFe and CAFe-S, which enable efficient biased compression without violating user privacy or requiring client-side state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the communication constraints in FL caused by high uplink transmission costs, especially when dealing with asymmetric bandwidth limits, while preserving user privacy and ensuring convergence.

Method: The paper introduces two frameworks: CAFe, which utilizes globally aggregated updates as shared control variates, and CAFe-S, which uses server-guided updates generated with a private dataset for prediction. It builds upon Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) methods.

Result: The paper analytically proves CAFe's superiority compared to existing methods like DCGD under the non-convex regime, and also shows that CAFe-S improves convergence rates further when server data is representative. Experimental validation demonstrates their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Both CAFe and CAFe-S outperform existing biased compression schemes in FL, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution to communication bottlenecks with proven theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective TTS is proposed to refine outcomes across multiple pipeline stages rather than over time, addressing judge errors in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks often involve multi-stage processes with unverifiable rewards, making traditional iterative refinement prone to error accumulation.

Method: Selective TTS scales inference across pipeline stages and prunes low-quality outputs using stage-specific judges to stabilize the process.

Result: The authors demonstrated improvements in data visualization pipelines, achieving higher mean scores (from 61.64 to 65.86) and reduced variance.

Conclusion: Selective TTS improves processing in open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, offering a new direction for scalable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum generative models in analyzing compressed latent space data from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, an area previously unexplored.

Method: The researchers employed a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate CFD data. They compressed the data into a 7D latent space through a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Quantum models QCBM and QGAN, along with a classical LSTM model, were used for generative tasks.

Result: Quantum models outperformed the classical baseline (LSTM) in terms of producing samples closer to the true distribution, with QCBM achieving the best performance metrics.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility and superiority of quantum generative models for latent representations of CFD, establishing a pivotal foundation for further research on integrating quantum computing with fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of quantum generative models to learned latent space representations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized approaches to representation learning are underexplored despite their potential advantages in distributed settings.

Method: The study introduces an alternating projected gradient algorithm and evaluates its effectiveness in decentralized representation learning.

Result: The proposed method reduces communication complexity without compromising accuracy and demonstrates superior performance in certain decentralized scenarios.

Conclusion: Decentralized representation learning can outperform centralized approaches, especially under constrained communication networks.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments, aiming to extract common features from related tasks. While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the use of ultrametric $p$-adic numbers, an alternative to traditional real-number spaces, for hierarchically structured problems in machine learning.

Method: The authors establish foundational models and algorithms for applying $p$-adic spaces to classification, regression, and representation learning. They demonstrate its effectiveness using compact $p$-adic linear networks.

Result: The study successfully shows the utility of $p$-adic numbers for tasks like hierarchical representation learning, which is not feasible using traditional real-number fields.

Conclusion: $p$-adic numbers provide a new perspective for machine learning, offering unique advantages for hierarchical data, and pave the way for further exploration in this alternative mathematical framework.

Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.

Motivation: Develop predictive tools for power outages caused by rare but impactful extreme events to better understand community vulnerability and enhance preparedness.

Method: Using EAGLE-I data (2014–2024), weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal data, the paper evaluates four machine learning models (RF, SVM, AdaBoost, LSTM) on Michigan county-level data.

Result: The LSTM model showed the lowest prediction error, and the analysis highlighted that better economic conditions and infrastructure reduce outage occurrences.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates LSTM's efficacy in predicting power outages and reinforces the relationship between societal factors and outage risk.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address confusion caused by the plethora of deep learning models for time series forecasting and conflicting empirical results by identifying fundamental design principles.

Method: The paper analyzes key concepts like locality and globality in forecasting architectures, evaluates their impact, and introduces an auxiliary 'forecasting model card' for evaluation.

Result: The study shows that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures often match state-of-the-art performance and that overlooked implementation details affect empirical results significantly.

Conclusion: The paper encourages revisiting benchmark practices and focusing on foundational principles in forecasting model design, offering tools for clearer evaluation of architectures.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly popular in time series applications. However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.

Conclusion: FoldAct improves the alignment of large language models using RL over long horizons, stabilizing the training process while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models faces critical scalability challenges from unbounded context growth, leading to context folding methods that compress interaction history during task execution. However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \textbf{FoldAct}\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost. Our method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, addressing the non-stationary observation problem while improving training efficiency with 5.19$\times$ speedup.

### [421] [When Does Multi-Task Learning Fail? Quantifying Data Imbalance and Task Independence in Metal Alloy Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22740)
*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task learning (MTL) is tested on alloy property predictions, using 54,028 samples. Results show it worsens regression but enhances classification, advising its selective use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Multi-task learning (MTL) can improve prediction accuracy for related alloy material properties.

Method: The study implements MTL and single-task models to simultaneously predict electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability, comparing performance using regression and classification metrics.

Result: MTL decreases regression performance significantly (e.g., resistivity $R^2$ from 0.897 to 0.844), but improves classification outcomes (e.g., amorphous-forming ability F1 from 0.703 to 0.744). This difference is linked to negative transfer stemming from data imbalance.

Conclusion: MTL is suitable for improving classification tasks where recall is key but is less effective for precise regression tasks due to property independence and data imbalance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) assumes related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged for better predictions. We test this by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples. We compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL. Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence. Regression failure is attributed to negative transfer caused by severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples). We recommend independent models for precise regression, while reserving MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

*Rihong Qiu,Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Xin Gao,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents HEROSQL, a model for improving semantic validation in Text-to-SQL tasks by integrating hierarchical representations and generating fine-grained annotations for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in semantic validation for Text-to-SQL by capturing both global user intent and structural SQL details while improving semantic error detection.

Method: It introduces HEROSQL, using hierarchical SQL representations (Logical Plans and Abstract Syntax Trees) and a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN), along with an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy.

Result: HEROSQL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing an average improvement of 9.40% in AUPRC and 12.35% in AUROC for detecting semantic mismatches in Text-to-SQL.

Conclusion: HEROSQL enhances semantic error detection, improves feedback to language models, and boosts the reliability and interpretability of Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translates natural language questions into SQL statements grounded in a target database schema. Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.

*Chumeng Liang,Zhanyang Jin,Zahaib Akhtar,Mona Pereira,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphLogDebugger, a framework using dynamic graphs for debugging tabular logs, outperforming LLMs with simpler Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent models for analyzing tabular logs rely heavily on LLMs, which lack flexibility and scalability in processing text-enriched data.

Method: The framework converts tabular logs into dynamic graphs by representing objects/events as heterogeneous nodes and linking them with edges, enabling debugging with efficient dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets from computer systems and academic papers demonstrate that GraphLogDebugger performs better than LLMs in debugging tasks.

Conclusion: GraphLogDebugger offers a scalable and flexible tool that simplifies the debugging process of tabular logs while achieving superior results compared to heavy-load language models.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

TL;DR: The paper examines pricing strategies of revenue-maximizing third-party platforms under demand uncertainty, presenting an efficient algorithm for demand learning amidst supply-side noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in demand learning for revenue-maximizing platforms, especially under market conditions with limited data observability and noise.

Method: An algorithm with optimal regret bounds is developed, leveraging instrumental variables and a novel mathematical construction for robust demand estimation, even using deep neural networks.

Result: The approach achieves optimal regret under complex market conditions and demonstrates practical relevance through simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances demand learnability for strategic platforms, introducing novel mathematical tools and confirming real-world applicability.

Abstract: We study the pricing behavior of third-party platforms facing strategic agents. Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\Tilde{\cO}(\sqrt{T}\wedgeσ_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of demand, leading to a phase transition in regret. Technically, we show that non-i.i.d. actions can serve as instrumental variables for learning demand. We also propose a novel homeomorphic construction that allows us to establish estimation bounds without assuming star-shapedness, providing the first efficiency guarantee for learning demand with deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

### [425] [A Micro-Macro Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Childhood Obesity Risk Using NHANES and Environmental Determinants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22758)
*Eswarasanthosh Kumar Mamillapalli,Nishtha Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning framework integrating individual and environmental data to predict childhood obesity and identify disparities in obesity risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing childhood obesity as a public health challenge by understanding interactions between individual, household, and environmental risk factors.

Method: A micro-macro machine learning framework was created using NHANES individual-level data and macro-level environment features (food access, air quality, socioeconomic vulnerability). Models like XGBoost and others were trained, while a state-level environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was developed.

Result: XGBoost showed the best prediction performance. Geographic correlations between environmental burden and obesity risk were revealed, illustrating the feasibility of linking multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, multi-level modeling approach, valuable for public health interventions and data-driven analytics.

Abstract: Childhood obesity remains a major public health challenge in the United States, strongly influenced by a combination of individual-level, household-level, and environmental-level risk factors. Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM fine-tuning by combining imitation and reinforcement learning, addressing challenges in token-level learning and reward optimization.

Method: The framework derives a decomposition of the composite objective's gradient into Dense Gradient (token imitation) and Sparse Gradient (long-horizon optimization). It includes an efficient logit-level formula for computation.

Result: Offers an efficient and unified method for optimizing LLMs with both dense and sparse gradients.

Conclusion: The proposed framework streamlines LLM fine-tuning, leveraging efficient computing techniques for optimal performance.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning that integrates Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

*Xuyan Li,Jie Wang,Zheng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRExplainer, an explanation method for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) that is universal, efficient, and user-friendly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the lack of transparency and explainability in TGNNs, as existing methods have limited generality, inefficiency, and usability issues.

Method: The proposed GRExplainer uses node sequences for a unified feature representation, applies breadth-first search, temporal information for efficiency, and leverages an RNN-based generative model for user-friendly explanation generation.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets and three TGNN models demonstrate GRExplainer's superiority in generality, efficiency, and usability over existing methods.

Conclusion: GRExplainer addresses key limitations in TGNN explainability by providing a universal, efficient, and user-friendly solution adaptable to different TGNN formats.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

*Huan Song,Qingfei Zhao,Ting Long,Shuyu Tian,Hongjun An,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends neural scaling laws to account for "familial models," introducing granularity (G) as a new scaling variable alongside model size (N) and tokens (D).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current scaling laws focusing solely on dense model outputs and to optimize the training-deploy paradigm across heterogeneous edge-cloud hierarchies.

Method: The authors introduce a unified functional form L(N, D, G), employ an IsoFLOP experimental design, and run systematic experiments across model sizes, granularities, and tokens while isolating architectural impacts.

Result: Results show that the granularity penalty follows a small exponent power law, bridging fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures and validating flexible deployment without sacrificing compute efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings theoretically and practically support the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, ensuring deployment flexibility while maintaining computational optimality.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Schrödinger AI introduces a quantum mechanics-inspired framework for robust machine learning with three key components focusing on semantic wavefunction dynamics, spectral decomposition, and symbolic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning framework inspired by the principles of quantum mechanics.

Method: Proposes a three-component system: time-independent wave-energy solver, time-dependent dynamical solver for adaptive reasoning, and low-rank operator calculus for learning symbolic transformations.

Result: Demonstrates emergent semantic manifolds, adaptive reasoning in dynamic environments, and superior performance on modular arithmetic tasks with extrapolation.

Conclusion: Schrödinger AI provides a physics-driven alternative to conventional training methods, potentially redefining learning as navigating semantic energy landscapes.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Circuit-TR, an algorithm leveraging causal transportability for zero-shot compositional generalization and supervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in generalizing across unseen domains using causal transportability theory and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: A causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle to transport modules from source to target domain for prediction.

Result: Theoretical findings linking few-shot learnability to circuit complexity, supported by controlled simulations.

Conclusion: Circuit transportability can improve generalization and few-shot learning through structured causal approaches.

Abstract: Generalization across the domains is not possible without asserting a structure that constrains the unseen target domain w.r.t. the source domain. Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: VL-RouterBench introduces a systematic benchmark for evaluating vision-language routing models, covering 14 datasets, 17 models, and 10 routing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a systematic and reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) used in multimodal routing.

Method: VL-RouterBench is proposed as a benchmark based on raw inference and scoring logs. It evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, cost, and throughput. A ranking score is computed using the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy.

Result: The study evaluates 10 routing methods using VL-RouterBench and identifies a significant improvement in routability. However, current routers still lag behind an ideal Oracle, showing room for advancement.

Conclusion: VL-RouterBench provides a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation platform, highlighting areas for improvement in router architectures and encouraging better multimodal routing methods.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

TL;DR: The study examines COVID-19 transmission in China using tracking data, revealing regional differences and shifts in infection sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective public health interventions in mitigating COVID-19 by analyzing SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns.

Method: Data collection from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and social media, followed by NLP and manual analysis to construct transmission chains and analyze mobility data.

Result: Larger cities had more infections due to social activities. Most symptomatic individuals were hospitalized within 5 days, and infection sources shifted from travel-related to socially driven transmission.

Conclusion: Public health strategies should adapt to regional and temporal shifts in infection sources to effectively manage disease spread.

Abstract: A comprehensive retrospective analysis of public health interventions, such as large scale testing, quarantining, and contact tracing, can help identify mechanisms most effective in mitigating COVID-19. We investigate China based SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns (e.g., infection type and likely transmission source) using publicly released tracking data. We collect case reports from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and official local government social media, then apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission/tracking chains. We further analyze tracking data together with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify and visualize temporal and spatial spread dynamics. Results indicate substantial regional differences, with larger cities showing more infections, likely driven by social activities. Most symptomatic individuals (79\%) were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset, and those with confirmed-case contact sought admission in under 5 days. Infection sources also shifted over time: early cases were largely linked to travel to (or contact with travelers from) Hubei Province, while later transmission was increasingly associated with social activities.

TL;DR: This study introduces SNM-Net, a deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition to address signal drift and unknown interference challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E-nose systems struggle with signal drift and unknown gas interference during open-set gas recognition. Existing methods inadequately account for anisotropic feature distributions and intensity variability, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The proposed SNM-Net introduces geometric decoupling with cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization to project features onto a hypersphere, coupled with Mahalanobis distance scoring for adaptive decision boundaries. It's compatible with CNN, RNN, and Transformer architectures.

Result: Experiments using the Vergara dataset show that Transformer+SNM achieves a near-perfect AUROC of 0.9977 and detects unknown gases with 99.57% accuracy, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SNM-Net addresses the challenges in E-nose systems by offering high accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for industrial deployment in gas recognition applications.

Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based distillation framework for diffusion models to improve efficiency by optimizing steps through a reward-driven training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the slow sampling issue in diffusion models by creating an optimized approach that allows models to take longer, efficient steps rather than incremental ones.

Method: The method involves treating the distillation process as a reinforcement learning-driven policy optimization, where the student model learns using a reward signal based on alignment with the teacher model's outputs.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and reduced computational resources compared to existing distillation methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a more efficient, model-agnostic optimization paradigm for diffusion models, enhancing their performance while maintaining compatibility across different model types.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to train AI language models for generating research plans using reinforcement learning and self-grading with rubrics extracted from real papers, achieving improvements in plan quality and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current AI language models in generating coherent, constraint-abiding research plans, and to enable their effective use as co-scientists for research tasks.

Method: The approach extracts research goals and grading rubrics from a corpus of diverse research papers. It applies reinforcement learning with self-grading using a frozen grader model to assess and improve research plan generation without human supervision.

Result: Expert evaluation for machine learning research goals shows a 70% preference for the finetuned model's plans, with an 84% approval rate for extracted rubrics. Generalization tests across multiple domains, including medical research, show 12-22% relative improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed automated training approach highlights a practical step toward scaling and improving general-purpose AI co-scientists, with significant enhancement in plan generation quality and domain adaptability.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

### [436] [MoR: Mixture Of Representations For Mixed-Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22804)
*Bor-Yiing Su,Peter Dykas,Mike Chrzanowski,Jatin Chhugani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores a novel dynamic quantization framework in mixed-precision training called Mixture-of-Representations (MoR). It dynamically chooses between FP8 and BF16 for tensors, achieving state-of-the-art results and preserving model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mixed-precision training methods require the correct combination of strategies for success, and finding new ways to enhance both performance and quality is essential. This work seeks to improve robustness and efficiency in low precision training.

Method: The paper introduces the Mixture-of-Representations (MoR) framework, which dynamically analyzes tensor properties and selects optimal representations (FP8 or BF16) at per-tensor and sub-tensor levels. Algorithms under the framework are universal and applicable to diverse datasets and strategies.

Result: The study achieved state-of-the-art results, quantizing 98.38% of tensors to FP8 while maintaining model performance similar to prior approaches without requiring complex fine-grain strategies.

Conclusion: Dynamic, property-aware quantization, as implemented in the MoR framework, can significantly enhance low-precision training methods, offering robustness and flexibility in representation choices, and can complement emerging number formats like NVFP4.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training is a crucial technique for scaling deep learning models, but successful mixedprecision training requires identifying and applying the right combination of training methods. This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.

*Scott A. Martin,Noah Brenowitz,Dale Durran,Michael Pritchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces long-range distillation, a method using AI-generated synthetic data to train long-timestep probabilistic models for improved long-range weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address instability and limited training data issues in AI weather models for long-range forecasting, as errors accumulate over autoregressive rolling and reanalysis datasets offer insufficient climate variability samples.

Method: A long-timestep probabilistic student model is trained using synthetic climate data generated by a short-timestep autoregressive teacher model, leveraging over 10,000 years of simulated data.

Result: Distilled models outperform climatology and approach auto-regressive teacher skill, with comparable S2S forecast skill to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AI-generated synthetic training data can scale long-range forecasting skill, paving the way for improved weather prediction models.

Abstract: Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic "student" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive "teacher" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.

*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Student-Teacher paradigm with Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to improve Goal-Conditioned RL by dynamically prioritizing high-uncertainty goals, achieving notable success over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning suffers from sample inefficiency due to uniform goal selection in multi-goal settings.

Method: The method uses a Student-Teacher learning paradigm where the teacher prioritizes goals with high temporal variance in the Q-values, guiding the student to focus on uncertain but informative tasks.

Result: The approach surpasses state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods across 11 diverse tasks in robotic manipulation and maze navigation.

Conclusion: The Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum effectively accelerates and improves Goal-Conditioned RL, with a theoretical basis and wide applicability in RL frameworks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant success in solving single-goal tasks. However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.

*S. Dai,G. Sun,F. Li,X. Tang,Q. Wang,Y. Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Federated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC) to improve spectral clustering in decentralized environments, addressing the limitations of pseudo-labeling and heterogeneous client correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral clustering models are ineffective in decentralized settings and federated learning suffers from issues with unreliable pseudo-labels and inadequate handling of heterogeneous client relationships.

Method: The FMTC framework combines client-specific clustering models with a server-side tensorial correlation module using low-rank regularization, solved through a privacy-preserving distributed optimization algorithm.

Result: Experiments show that FMTC outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering methods across real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FMTC offers a robust solution for decentralized and heterogeneous client clustering in a privacy-preserving manner, enhancing performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetaCD, a meta-learning framework incorporating continual learning to enhance cognitive diagnosis, addressing challenges like data imbalance and adaptability to dynamic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of existing cognitive diagnosis methods, which struggle with long-tailed data distributions and dynamic changes in student data.

Method: The authors propose MetaCD, which utilizes meta-learning for optimal initialization and a parameter protection mechanism for continual learning. This approach handles data imbalance and provides adaptability to new tasks and skills.

Result: MetaCD shows improved accuracy and generalization compared to other methods, as evidenced by experiments conducted on five real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MetaCD effectively addresses cognitive diagnosis challenges, enhancing both the stability and plasticity of models across sequential and single tasks.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is an essential research topic in intelligent education, aimed at assessing the level of mastery of different skills by students. So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.

### [441] [Sat-EnQ: Satisficing Ensembles of Weak Q-Learners for Reliable and Compute-Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22910)
*Ünver Çiftçi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sat-EnQ, a framework that initially focuses on being 'good enough' before optimizing further, to enhance stability in Deep Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Q-learning algorithms are unstable, especially during early training, due to overestimation issues caused by the maximization operator.

Method: The framework employs a two-phase approach: Phase 1 trains lightweight Q-networks with a satisficing objective to limit value growth and reduce variability; Phase 2 distills and fine-tunes the ensemble into a larger Double DQN network.

Result: Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x reduction in variance, avoids catastrophic failures, sustains 79% performance under environmental noise, and reduces computational requirements by 2.5x compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretically and empirically validated method to make reinforcement learning more robust by first learning with constrained growth before aggressive optimization.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning algorithms remain notoriously unstable, especially during early training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors. Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles. Our results highlight a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning by embracing satisficing before optimization.

*Vincent Herrmann,Eric Alcaide,Michael Wand,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing Multiple Token Divergence (MTD) as a lightweight computational effort metric for language models, and employing Divergence Steering for decoding control to improve model output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity, and prior compressibility-based methods are invasive and unstable. Hence, a simpler approach to analyze computational effort is needed.

Method: MTD measures computational effort using KL divergence between a model's prediction outputs and an auxiliary shallow prediction head. It requires no extra training and uses pre-trained models. Divergence Steering leverages MTD for decoding control.

Result: Empirical tests show MTD effectively distinguishes complex tasks from simple ones and correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is linked to better mathematical reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: MTD is a practical tool for measuring and steering computational effort in language models, outperforming prior methods in stability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Measuring the in-context computational effort of language models is a key challenge, as metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity. Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning. MTD provides a practical, lightweight tool for analyzing and steering the computational dynamics of language models.

*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APO introduces an anchored framework leveraging Csiszar alpha-divergence to balance mode-covering and mode-seeking in reinforcement learning from human feedback, showing competitive performance and improved stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods suffer from either mode-covering (under-exploit high-reward modes) or mode-seeking (risk of mode collapse) challenges, requiring a balance.

Method: APO uses Csiszar alpha-divergence for continuous interpolation between forward and reverse KL behaviors within anchored geometry, with a dynamic alpha schedule based on reward and confidence.

Result: Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B show APO performs competitively with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining stability.

Conclusion: APO successfully integrates mode-covering and mode-seeking advantages, presenting a stable and effective framework for reinforcement learning alignment tasks.

Abstract: Two divergence regimes dominate modern alignment practice. Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of access to real-world longitudinal data on work-life balance and wellbeing due to privacy and logistical constraints, which hinders research, benchmarking, and education in areas like stress modeling and machine learning.

Method: FLOW synthesizes data using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation to model temporal dynamics across variables like stress, sleep, mood, activity, and weight for 1,000 individuals over two years.

Result: A publicly available, configurable dataset with daily resolution, accompanied by a data generation tool for experimentation under adjustable assumptions.

Conclusion: FLOW provides a resource for controlled experimentation and benchmarking while bypassing the challenges of obtaining sensitive human-centric data, though it's not meant to replace real-world datasets.

Abstract: Access to longitudinal, individual-level data on work-life balance and wellbeing is limited by privacy, ethical, and logistical constraints. This poses challenges for reproducible research, methodological benchmarking, and education in domains such as stress modeling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning.
  We introduce FLOW, a synthetic longitudinal dataset designed to model daily interactions between workload, lifestyle behaviors, and wellbeing. FLOW is generated using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation that produces coherent temporal dynamics across variables such as stress, sleep, mood, physical activity, and body weight. The dataset simulates 1{,}000 individuals over a two-year period with daily resolution and is released as a publicly available resource.
  In addition to the static dataset, we describe a configurable data generation tool that enables reproducible experimentation under adjustable behavioral and contextual assumptions. FLOW is intended as a controlled experimental environment rather than a proxy for observed human populations, supporting exploratory analysis, methodological development, and benchmarking where real-world data are inaccessible.

TL;DR: The study presents a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG-based sleep staging with improved detection for challenging stages like N1, achieving competitive accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies in existing automatic sleep staging methods, including class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and lack of interpretability.

Method: The paper introduces a framework integrating multi-scale feature extraction, temporal modeling, class-weighted loss functions, and data augmentation to enhance sleep staging performance for single-channel EEG.

Result: The proposed framework achieves high accuracy (89.72%) and F1-score (85.46%) overall, with significant improvements for N1 sleep stage detection (61.7% F1-score) compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The framework advances the performance and interpretability of automatic sleep staging using single-channel EEG signals, proving its practicality for clinical applications.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: This paper critiques the current trend in multimodal deep learning research, demonstrating that simpler models like SimBaMM perform comparably to more complex architectures under rigorous conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that increasing complexity in multimodal-specific deep learning methods inherently improves performance, and to promote rigor in evaluation.

Method: A large-scale empirical study reimplements and evaluates 19 multimodal methods across multiple datasets and conditions, introducing SimBaMM, a simple late-fusion Transformer architecture.

Result: Finds that SimBaMM performs comparably to complex models under standardized evaluation and often matches unimodal baselines, especially in smaller datasets.

Conclusion: Emphasizes methodological rigor over architectural complexity and presents a checklist for robust evaluations to advance the field of multimodal learning.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.

*Fuli Qiao,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for continual learning in LLMs by orthogonally initializing and merging LoRAs, addressing memory constraints and task interference issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, memory growth, and task interference in continual learning for LLMs.

Method: The authors use orthogonal basis extraction for initializing new tasks and a time-aware scaling mechanism to merge LoRA updates into a unified representation.

Result: The approach ensures constant memory complexity, reduces task interference, and improves performance compared to traditional LoRA merging techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and efficient for continual learning in LLMs, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive benchmarking experiments.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the accuracy loss in Federated Learning under Non-IID data through mechanistic interpretability, attributing the issue to circuit collapse caused by conflicting client updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover the internal reasons behind accuracy degradation in FL under Non-IID conditions, as traditional explanations leave the causes unclear.

Method: The researchers apply mechanistic interpretability using interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks to track and quantify circuit preservation across clients and communication rounds within the FL framework.

Result: The study provides the first mechanistic evidence showing Non-IID data causes divergence and degradation of structurally distinct local circuits in FL models.

Conclusion: The findings link statistical drift in FL to observable failures in mechanistic preservation and suggest avenues for developing targeted solutions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models on decentralized data, but its performance degrades significantly under Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data conditions. While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Multimodal Foundation Model (PI-MFM) to improve learning PDE solution operators by incorporating physics into training, significantly outperforming data-driven models, especially under data-limited conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal foundation models for solving PDEs are data-intensive and lack physical principles during training. This paper aims to create a more efficient and physics-compliant framework for learning PDE operators.

Method: The PI-MFM framework enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation by using symbolic PDE representations. It assembles PDE residual losses via vectorized derivative computation and uses unified physics-informed objectives.

Result: PI-MFM outperforms data-driven models on 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, especially under sparse data conditions. It also demonstrates robustness to noise and cost-effective strategies for precision and accuracy.

Conclusion: PI-MFM presents a scalable, efficient, and innovative approach to learning PDE solvers by integrating physics into multimodal foundation models. Its ability for efficient pretraining and adaptable fine-tuning sets a benchmark for practical PDE solutions.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical systems, and recent multimodal foundation models have shown promise for learning PDE solution operators across diverse equation families. However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Phase Gradient Flow (PGF) to improve memory efficiency and computational stability when performing gradient-based sensitivity analysis in Selective State Space Models, enabling genomic-scale modeling on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the memory constraints inherent in standard Autograd methods, which prevent large-scale (genomic-scale) modeling due to linear memory scaling in backpropagation.

Method: PGF reframes SSM dynamics using the Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE) method to achieve exact derivatives without explicitly constructing computational graphs, allowing for O(1) memory usage relative to sequence length.

Result: The method achieves a 94% reduction in peak VRAM usage, a 23x increase in throughput, and enables analysis of sequences up to 128,000 steps without memory failures, unlike standard methods.

Conclusion: PGF provides a scalable solution for performing gradient analysis on state-space models, bridging the gap between infinite-context theoretical methods and real-world hardware limitations, and unlocking genome-scale modeling on a single GPU.

Abstract: Selective State Space Models (SSMs) achieve linear-time inference, yet their gradient-based sensitivity analysis remains bottlenecked by O(L) memory scaling during backpropagation. This memory constraint precludes genomic-scale modeling (L > 10^5) on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce Phase Gradient Flow (PGF), a framework that computes exact analytical derivatives by operating directly in the state-space manifold, bypassing the need to materialize the intermediate computational graph. By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models. Our work enables chromosome-scale sensitivity analysis on a single GPU, bridging the gap between theoretical infinite-context models and practical hardware limitations.

*Boyang Zhang,Xiaobing Chen,Songyang Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Xiangwei Zhou,Mingxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLEX-MoE is a federated learning framework designed to address resource constraints and expert load imbalance in Mixture-of-Experts models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address two significant challenges in deploying Mixture-of-Experts models with federated learning: limited storage capacity on edge devices and the negative impact of non-IID data distributions on model performance.

Method: The proposed method introduces client-expert fitness scores for quantifying expert suitability for local datasets and employs an optimization-based algorithm to balance expert utilization while ensuring client-expert specialization.

Result: The proposed framework shows superior performance in experiments on three datasets and can maintain balanced expert utilization in varying resource-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: FLEX-MoE provides an effective solution to scalability and performance issues in federated learning by jointly optimizing expert assignments and utilization balancing while addressing device constraints and data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable neural networks through conditional computation. However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.

### [452] [Rethinking Fine-Tuning: Unlocking Hidden Capabilities in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23073)
*Mingyuan Zhang,Yue Bai,Yifan Wang,Yiyang Huang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT), achieving superior performance without altering the frozen backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for VLMs often update weights directly, missing opportunities to utilize pre-trained model structures effectively. The authors aim to explore structural reorganizations via a novel approach inspired by MFT.

Method: The study applies MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs, assigning learnable gating scores to reorganize internal subnetworks for task adaptation. This method is compared against PEFT approaches like LoRA.

Result: MFT consistently outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning, demonstrating high performance in task adaptation without updating backbone weights.

Conclusion: Reorganizing the connections within pre-trained models can achieve efficient and effective task adaptation, providing a compelling alternative to traditional weight-updating fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

### [453] [Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23076)
*Deyang Zheng,Tianyi Zhang,Wenming Zheng,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC) framework to capture higher-order multimodal dependencies that are crucial for affective computing. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in affective computing rely on pairwise alignment objectives that struggle to fully capture complex multimodal physiological responses, posing challenges due to subjective and scarce annotations.

Method: The paper proposes MFMC, a self-supervised learning framework based on Dual Total Correlation (DTC). It employs functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) to optimize multimodal interactions beyond pairwise contrasts.

Result: MFMC achieves improved performance across three benchmarks, including CEAP-360VR where subject-dependent accuracy increased from 78.9% to 86.8% and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1%, especially using EDA signals.

Conclusion: MFMC is robust in handling inter-subject variability and higher-order multimodal interactions, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods in affective computing.

Abstract: Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.
  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.
  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

*Yankang Li,Changsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SE-MLP model to efficiently predict penetration acceleration feature values, overcoming the computational demands of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a faster and more accurate method for predicting penetration acceleration feature values without the need for lengthy simulations and high computational costs.

Method: The authors propose the SE-MLP model, incorporating a channel attention mechanism and residual connections, to predict acceleration feature values from physical parameters efficiently.

Result: The SE-MLP outperforms traditional models like MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer in prediction accuracy, stability, and generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of its novel components.

Conclusion: SE-MLP provides a feasible, practical solution for generating prior feature values for penetration applications, validated through numerical simulations and range recovery tests.

Abstract: Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dedicated dataset for weak signal learning (WSL) and proposes a custom PDVFN model. The methods achieve improved performance in weak signals, high noise, and extreme imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extracting weak signals masked by noise and the lack of specialized datasets in fields like fault diagnosis and autonomous driving.

Method: The study constructs a dataset with 13,158 spectral samples characterized by low SNR and class imbalance. It also introduces a dual-view representation and a PDVFN model for better feature extraction.

Result: The proposed approach enhances accuracy and robustness in weak signal scenarios, particularly in low SNR and class imbalance conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: This research establishes a foundation for WSL tasks by offering a specialized dataset, a novel baseline model, and demonstrating effective strategies for weak signal scenarios.

Abstract: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the relatively unexplored field of decentralized representation learning and develop efficient methods for multi-task learning in data-scarce environments.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm based on decentralized projected gradient descent, focusing on multi-task linear regression with shared low-dimensional representations. They design an alternating gradient descent and minimization technique in a federated setting.

Result: The paper provides provable guarantees for sample and iteration complexities, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm is fast, communication-efficient, and validated against benchmark algorithms through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The developed decentralized learning algorithm effectively combines low-rank representation recovery and federated frameworks, offering both theoretical and numerical validation of its efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments to obtain a feature extractor or representation from various different yet related tasks. Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.

*Qingyu Yin,Yulun Wu,Zhennan Shen,Sunbowen Li,Zhilin Wang,Yanshu Li,Chak Tou Leong,Jiale Kang,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 12 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on math reasoning tasks. Alternatives to standard methods like LoRA outperform, while certain reduction techniques fail due to alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to identify optimal PEFT architectures for RLVR as current approaches like LoRA are suboptimal and lack a systematic evaluation for effectiveness in improving reasoning capabilities.

Method: The researchers conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 12 PEFT methodologies under RLVR using mathematical reasoning benchmarks, supported by ablations and scaling experiments.

Result: Results show that structural variants such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS outperform LoRA, while SVD-informed strategies suffer from spectral collapse, and extreme parameter reductions bottleneck reasoning.

Conclusion: This work encourages exploring better PEFT methods for RLVR and provides guidance for optimizing parameter-efficient techniques for improved reasoning in language models.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel peptide language model, HELM-BERT, leveraging the HELM representation, surpasses SMILES-based models in key tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular language models fail to adequately represent the complexity of therapeutic peptides, hindering advancements in drug development.

Method: HELM-BERT, a DeBERTa-based encoder model, is trained on the hierarchical HELM notation, utilizing a curated dataset of 39,079 peptides.

Result: HELM-BERT outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based models in predicting cyclic peptide membrane permeability and peptide-protein interactions.

Conclusion: HELM-based representations enable precise and data-efficient modeling for therapeutic peptides, addressing gaps in current molecular language models.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have emerged as a pivotal modality in modern drug discovery, occupying a chemically and topologically rich space. While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.

Methods: VCUS videos were acquired from 30 volunteers, which were split into still frames and cropped to a uniform size. Healthy and simulated VCP images were used as training data for vocal cord segmentation and VCP classification models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of modeling PDEs on large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries and to resolve the problem of Geometric Aliasing caused by dimensionality reduction in existing methods.

Method: PGOT introduces Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention), which uses a physics slicing-geometry injection mechanism and multi-scale geometric encodings to preserve geometric features efficiently. It dynamically chooses computational paths based on spatial features, ensuring precision and scalability.

Result: PGOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four standard benchmarks and demonstrates superior capability in large-scale industrial applications like airfoil and car design.

Conclusion: The proposed PGOT effectively addresses Geometric Aliasing while enabling adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling, offering an efficient and accurate tool for handling complex geometrical PDEs.

Abstract: While Transformers have demonstrated remarkable potential in modeling Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), modeling large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries remains a significant challenge. Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF) to improve efficiency and scalability in IoT-based Federated Learning, incorporating tensor operation approximation to reduce communication costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and scalability issues faced by Federated Learning in resource-constrained IoT edge devices, particularly during the training of deep neural networks.

Method: FedOLF freezes neural network layers in a defined order during training to reduce computation and memory requirements, while employing Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA) to cut down communication and energy costs.

Result: FedOLF significantly outperforms existing FL methods in terms of accuracy (0.3%-6.4% higher across different datasets) while demonstrating improved energy efficiency and reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: FedOLF provides an efficient and scalable solution for privacy-preserving Federated Learning in IoT environments, combining ordered layer freezing with tensor operation approximation for optimal performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PFed-Signal, a federated learning-based model to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by eliminating biased data in FAERS records using Euclidean distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current ADR prediction methods relying on statistical approaches (e.g. ROR and PRR) fail to address biases in FAERS data, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: PFed-Signal employs federated learning and Transformer-based ADR prediction. The process involves splitting the dataset, identifying biased data using Euclidean distance, and training a clean dataset for better prediction.

Result: The method outperforms traditional techniques in terms of ROR, PRR, accuracy (0.887), F1 score (0.890), recall rate (0.913), and AUC (0.957).

Conclusion: PFed-Signal provides a more accurate and reliable way to predict ADRs by addressing data bias, showcasing its potential as a superior alternative to traditional statistical methods.

Abstract: The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) predicted based on the biased records in FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) may mislead diagnosis online. Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the theoretical training dynamics of HC-PINNs and establishes a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework to analyze the impact of boundary functions on training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underlying training dynamics of HC-PINNs, specifically focusing on the impact of the boundary conditions enforced by the trial function ansatz, and addressing the limitations in heuristic design of boundary functions.

Method: The paper establishes a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, derives the kernel composition law, and performs spectral analysis to evaluate the training and optimization dynamics of HC-PINNs.

Result: The study shows that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ acts as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum and affecting training convergence. It identifies the effective rank of the residual kernel as a deterministic predictor of convergence and reveals issues like spectral collapse caused by conventional boundary functions.

Conclusion: The work transforms the design of boundary functions into a spectral optimization problem, offering a principled theoretical framework for HC-PINNs and advancing the use of geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored.
  Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape.
  A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law.
  This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel.
  Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers.
  It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction.
  Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding backpropagation mechanics in transformer architectures and to offer a manual approach for gaining deeper intuition.

Method: Extending lightweight, index-free backpropagation derivations to transformer layers, including embedding, multi-headed self-attention, layer normalization, and LoRA layers, supported by analytical gradient expressions and a minimalistic PyTorch GPT-like implementation.

Result: Explicit analytical gradient derivations for various transformer layers and demonstration of backpropagation mechanics using a minimalistic GPT-like PyTorch implementation.

Conclusion: Manually deriving backpropagation strengthens understanding of forward and backward passes in complex architectures, benefiting both intuition and theoretical understanding.

Abstract: This document is a follow-up to our previous paper dedicated to a vectorized derivation of backpropagation in CNNs. Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically?

### [466] [The Law of Multi-Model Collaboration: Scaling Limits of Model Ensembling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23340)
*Dakuan Lu,Jiaqi Zhang,Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a framework for scaling performance limits in LLM ensembles, showing improved results from model diversity and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional large language models (LLMs) are limited by performance bounds as individual models. The growing need to enhance their capabilities has led to interest in multi-model systems, but a theoretical framework for their scaling performance is missing.

Method: The paper proposes a scaling law for multi-model collaboration, utilizing a method-agnostic approach with an idealized integration oracle to derive performance limits based on aggregated parameter budgets. Experimental studies were conducted on ensemble systems.

Result: The study found that multi-model systems exhibit power-law scaling with better improvement trends and lower theoretical loss floors than single models. Heterogeneous model ensembles perform better than those using models from the same family.

Conclusion: Model collaboration and diversity are critical for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs, offering a pathway to surpass the intelligence limits of single models through collective multi-model systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.

*Hai Duong Nguyen,Xuan-The Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates and re-integrates morphological and rhythm features, improving ECG classification and addressing generalization and distribution shift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for ECG classification struggle with generalization across diverse acquisition settings due to entangled waveform morphology and rhythm dynamics, leading to sensitivity to distribution shifts.

Method: ECG-RAMBA separates morphological features using MiniRocket, global rhythm using HRV descriptors, and incorporates long-range contextual modeling through a bi-directional backbone. It introduces Power Mean pooling to enhance sensitivity to transient abnormalities during windowed inference.

Result: ECG-RAMBA achieved high classification performance on Chapman-Shaoxing dataset (macro ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85) and strong zero-shot transfer performance on external datasets like CPSC-2021 and PTB-XL. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of its distinct components.

Conclusion: The study showcases ECG-RAMBA as a robust solution for cross-domain ECG classification, emphasizing the significance of morphology separation, rhythm modeling, and context-aware fusion in improving generalization across heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ISOPO is a method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single step efficiently, offering an alternative to existing methods using multiple gradient steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing proximal policy methods that require multiple gradient steps to approximate natural policy gradients.

Method: ISOPO normalizes log-probability gradient in Fisher metric and uses microbatch advantages transformed through the neural tangent kernel, applied layer-wise with minimal computational cost.

Result: The proposed methods provide a straightforward and computationally efficient way to implement natural policy gradient approximation compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: ISOPO simplifies and enhances efficiency in natural policy gradient computation, offering practical benefits without significant computational burden.

Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimized low-bit quantization techniques enabling efficient deployment of openPangu-Embedded models with CoT reasoning modes on Ascend NPUs, achieving speed and memory improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of openPangu-Embedded models on Ascend NPUs faces challenges like memory and latency overhead due to extended reasoning traces from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms.

Method: The authors propose a unified low-bit inference framework, incorporating INT8 and W4A8 quantization to optimize openPangu-Embedded models' computations for the Atlas A2 hardware.

Result: Evaluation shows INT8 quantization preserves over 90% of FP16 accuracy with 1.5x speedup on Atlas A2, while W4A8 reduces memory usage with some accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Low-bit quantization allows efficient Chain-of-Thought reasoning for openPangu-Embedded models on Ascend NPUs, balancing performance, memory, and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Huawei's openPangu-Embedded-1B and openPangu-Embedded-7B, variants of the openPangu large language model, integrate three distinct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms, namely slow_think, auto_think, and no_think. While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.

*Xiao Ma,Mohammad Hasyim Taufik,Tariq Alkhalifah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a deep learning-based framework combining generative models with neural operators to efficiently build high-resolution velocity models for subsurface imaging, addressing conventional methods' computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional velocity model building methods are computationally intensive and slow, creating the need for efficient, high-resolution alternatives.

Method: The framework utilizes a neural operator for fast generation of reverse time migration (RTM) extended images and a generative model as a regularizer to refine the velocity model predictions.

Result: Experiments with synthetic and field data validated the approach's effectiveness in generating cleaner, higher resolution velocity models.

Conclusion: Combining generative models and neural operators offers a promising, efficient solution for high-resolution velocity model building, improving subsurface imaging capabilities.

Abstract: Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoLog, a framework for log anomaly detection using multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unimodal and multimodal approaches struggle with effectively utilizing log data modalities and their interactions.

Method: CoLog employs collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to handle interactions, alongside a modality adaptation layer for heterogeneity.

Result: CoLog achieves high-level anomaly detection performance, with 99.63% precision, 99.59% recall, and 99.61% F1 score across seven datasets.

Conclusion: CoLog provides a robust, unified framework for log anomaly detection with significant applicability in cybersecurity and system monitoring.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

TL;DR: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic networks. FgGSL, a frequency-guided structure learning approach, improves discriminatory power by constructing complementary graphs and using spectral encoders to learn features. It demonstrates superiority in various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of GNNs in learning discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes have weak label and feature similarity.

Method: FgGSL combines frequency information with task-driven topology learning by proposing a feature-driven masking function, label-based structural loss, and low/high-pass filter banks to infer and process graph structures.

Result: FgGSL outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods on six heterophilic benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in learning robust representations.

Conclusion: A frequency-based graph learning approach like FgGSL enhances discriminative abilities in heterophilic settings, securing a robust and superior performance across tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.

### [473] [Directly Constructing Low-Dimensional Solution Subspaces in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23410)
*Yusuf Kalyoncuoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to compress neural network classification heads by decoupling solution geometry from the high-dimensional optimization search space, achieving large compression factors with minimal impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art neural networks utilize high-dimensional widths not for representation but to tackle non-convex optimization challenges, making compact networks intractable.

Method: The authors introduce a constructive method to separate solution geometry from the ambient search space, enabling compression of classification heads and introducing Subspace-Native Distillation for stable training in reduced dimensions.

Result: Empirical tests on ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT show classification head compression by factors of 16 with negligible performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a pathway for compact student models to bypass high-dimensional optimization issues, aligning with the concept of 'Train Big, Deploy Small.'

Abstract: While it is well-established that the weight matrices and feature manifolds of deep neural networks exhibit a low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), current state-of-the-art models still rely on massive high-dimensional widths. This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.

TL;DR: STAMP is introduced as a novel framework for learning temporal dynamics in longitudinal medical datasets, addressing limitations in temporal awareness of Masked Autoencoding (MAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of temporal awareness in state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods like MAE for analyzing 3D medical datasets.

Method: The proposed method, STAMP, is a Siamese MAE framework that uses a stochastic process and variational inference to encode temporal information based on the time differences between input medical scans.

Result: STAMP showed superior performance over existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models in predicting disease progression for Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease using OCT and MRI datasets.

Conclusion: STAMP effectively captures non-deterministic temporal dynamics in diseases by leveraging stochastic temporal encoding, proving its efficacy over existing methods in disease progression tasks.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face issues like representation collapse and unstable gradients despite scaling capacity. The motivation was to develop a method that mitigates these challenges while improving efficiency.

Method: DSC uses a state-dependent, sparse expansion of shared basis vectors, employing Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation and introducing compositional rank-K approximations to reduce parameter complexity and memory usage.

Result: DSC reduces parameter complexity to O(Md) and memory traffic to O(Kd). It ensures continuity in weight updates and provides robust bounds through spectral constraints and regularization.

Conclusion: The proposed DSC method significantly improves upon the efficiency and stability of MoE models while maintaining scalability. Code is made available for further research and application.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models scale capacity but often suffer from representation collapse and gradient instability. We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DIR, an information-theoretic debiasing method for improving reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models face issues with inductive biases in training data, such as overfitting and reward hacking, which hinder model alignment with human values.

Method: The paper introduces DIR, inspired by the information bottleneck (IB) principle, which maximizes mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preferences while minimizing MI between RM scores and biased attributes.

Result: DIR successfully mitigates biases like response length, sycophancy, and format in experiments. It also improves RLHF performance and generalization across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: DIR effectively debiases RMs, addressing complex and non-linear biases, and enhances their applicability in real-world scenarios. This advancement strengthens RLHF systems and makes the methods more robust.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \textbf{D}ebiasing via \textbf{I}nformation optimization for \textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \textit{response length}, \textit{sycophancy}, and \textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRoD, a method for efficient fine-tuning of large models, which achieves full tuning accuracy with only 1.72% of trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are challenging to adapt to diverse tasks efficiently due to constraints in current PEFT methods, such as slow convergence and limited adaptation.

Method: FRoD employs hierarchical joint decomposition and rotational degrees of freedom to introduce globally shared bases and sparse, flexible parameter updates, enabling full-rank adaptation.

Result: FRoD achieves performance comparable to full model fine-tuning across 20 benchmarks while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters to 1.72%.

Conclusion: FRoD improves the adaptability and effectiveness of PEFT methods by addressing their limitations, offering both efficiency and expressiveness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication, especially under imperfect channel state information in IIoT networks, and improve system reliability and speed.

Method: The authors introduce a Bayesian optimization-driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) approach for joint link adaptation and device scheduling, enhancing algorithm convergence and reliability.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence and superior sum-rate performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively improves performance metrics such as convergence speed and transmission rate in IIoT networks, providing a robust solution despite imperfect channel information.

Abstract: In this article, we consider an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network supporting multi-device dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. A joint link adaptation (LA) and device scheduling (including the order) design is provided, aiming at maximizing the total transmission rate under strict block error rate (BLER) constraints. In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

Motivation: To improve model generalization and robustness in recognizing human emotions via EEG, particularly addressing the challenges posed by session variability.

Method: The proposed EGDA framework aligns both global and class-specific data distributions while preserving EEG data structure using graph regularization. Testing was conducted on the SEED-IV dataset.

Result: EGDA achieved high accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% in cross-session tasks, outperforming baseline methods. The Gamma frequency band and specific brain regions were found to be critical for emotion recognition.

Conclusion: EGDA significantly enhances cross-session generalization for emotion recognition in EEG data, offering a promising approach for robust human-machine interaction systems.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotional states is critical for effective human-machine interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework improves manufacturing quality control while preserving simplicity and usability.

Abstract: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.

Result: BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems on SWE benchmarks, achieving competitive leaderboard rankings, even surpassing larger models like GPT-4 and Claude.

Conclusion: Hierarchical multi-agent systems discovered through BOAD improve generalization in solving real-world SWE problems effectively under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a long-context language modeling method that utilizes test-time continual learning in standard Transformer architectures, achieving scalable and efficient processing without complex modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in long-context language modeling by rethinking it as a continual learning problem, moving beyond architectural complexities and focusing on improving efficiency and scalability.

Method: The authors use a sliding-window attention Transformer for next-token prediction at test time, compressing context into weights. They enhance this ability via meta-learning during training as part of an end-to-end (E2E) Test-Time Training (TTT) approach.

Result: Their method (TTT-E2E) exhibits comparable scalability to fully attention-based Transformers while maintaining constant inference time, achieving 2.7x faster performance at 128K context lengths compared to full attention.

Conclusion: TTT-E2E represents a significant advance in long-context language models, combining scalability, efficiency, and simplicity using continual learning and end-to-end training strategies.

Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.

### [483] [CosineGate: Semantic Dynamic Routing via Cosine Incompatibility in Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22206)
*Yogeswar Reddy Thota*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CosineGate, a method for reducing redundant computations in deep residual networks using cosine incompatibility as a gating signal, achieving efficiency and accuracy trade-offs on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep residual networks perform redundant computations due to evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. The paper seeks to make these computations more efficient while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, CosineGate, utilizes cosine incompatibility between identity and residual features to measure redundancy (Cosine Incompatibility Ratio). It employs Gumbel-Softmax for gating during training and a FLOPs regularization term to balance computation. It dynamically routes residual blocks based on data.

Result: On CIFAR-10, CosineGate configurations achieve accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, ranging from 89.9% accuracy with 24.1% FLOPs savings to 93.2% accuracy with minimal compute reduction. It excels in reducing computation while matching/exceeding ResNet-20 performance.

Conclusion: CosineGate demonstrates that geometric measures of feature incompatibility can effectively guide dynamic residual routing, reducing computation without requiring additional supervision or heuristics.

Abstract: Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3 percent) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide a principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing.

### [484] [Symbolic Specification and Reasoning for Quantum Data and Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22383)
*Mingsheng Ying*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Symbolic Operator Logic (SOL)" as a framework for symbolic reasoning and specification of quantum data and operations, addressing limitations in automated quantum verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a formal symbolic theory for quantum data and operations, which hampers the scalability and practical usability of automated verification tools in quantum computing.

Method: The approach involves embedding classical first-order logic into a formal logical framework (SOL) that incorporates symbolic operators and recursive definitions to specify and reason about quantum information.

Result: The result is the development of the SOL framework, which integrates classical reasoning tools into quantum verification, potentially boosting automated verification processes.

Conclusion: The SOL framework serves as a foundation for extending automated reasoning and theorem proving tools (e.g., Lean, Coq) to quantum computation, enabling formal verification.

Abstract: In quantum information and computation research, symbolic methods have been widely used for human specification and reasoning about quantum states and operations. At the same time, they are essential for ensuring the scalability and efficiency of automated reasoning and verification tools for quantum algorithms and programs. However, a formal theory for symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations is still lacking, which significantly limits the practical applicability of automated verification techniques in quantum computing.
  In this paper, we present a general logical framework, called Symbolic Operator Logic $\mathbf{SOL}$, which enables symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations. Within this framework, a classical first-order logical language is embedded into a language of formal operators used to specify quantum data and operations, including their recursive definitions. This embedding allows reasoning about their properties modulo a chosen theory of the underlying classical data (e.g., Boolean algebra or group theory), thereby leveraging existing automated verification tools developed for classical computing. It should be emphasised that this embedding of classical first-order logic into $\mathbf{SOL}$ is precisely what makes the symbolic method possible.
  We envision that this framework can provide a conceptual foundation for the formal verification and automated theorem proving of quantum computation and information in proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and related systems.

*Yuze Li,Srinivasan Ramachandra Sharma,Charitha Saumya,Ali R. Butt,Kirshanthan Sundararajah*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Branch mispredictions cause significant performance issues in processors. MERIT, a new compiler transformation technique, eliminates challenging data-dependent branches by melding similar operations at the IR instruction level. It achieves notable speedup and reduced overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Branch mispredictions, particularly involving data-dependent and irregular branches, negatively impact modern processor performance. Existing solutions, such as hardware predictors and software predication, fail in certain scenarios. This paper aims to address these limitations by improving branch prediction techniques.

Method: The study introduces MERIT, a compiler transformation that identifies and aligns similar operations from divergent code paths through sequence alignment and careful operand-level guarding. This eliminates branches at the IR level without relying on hardware predication.

Result: MERIT, implemented as an LLVM pass, was evaluated on 102 programs from four benchmark suites. It demonstrated a geometric mean speedup of 10.9%, with peak improvements of 32x, while reducing static instruction overhead.

Conclusion: MERIT effectively addresses the challenges of data-dependent branch mispredictions by employing a unique approach to eliminate branches at the IR level, providing significant performance gains without introducing extreme instruction overhead.

Abstract: Branch mispredictions cause catastrophic performance penalties in modern processors, leading to performance loss. While hardware predictors and profile-guided techniques exist, data-dependent branches with irregular patterns remain challenging. Traditional if-conversion eliminates branches via software predication but faces limitations on architectures like x86. It often fails on paths containing memory instructions or incurs excessive instruction overhead by fully speculating large branch bodies.
  This paper presents Melding IR Instructions (MERIT), a compiler transformation that eliminates branches by aligning and melding similar operations from divergent paths at the IR instruction level. By observing that divergent paths often perform structurally similar operations with different operands, MERIT adapts sequence alignment to discover merging opportunities and employs safe operand-level guarding to ensure semantic correctness without hardware predication. Implemented as an LLVM pass and evaluated on 102 programs from four benchmark suites, MERIT achieves a geometric mean speedup of 10.9% with peak improvements of 32x compared to hardware branch predictor, demonstrating the effectiveness with reduced static instruction overhead.

*Vasileios Koutavas,Yu-Yang Lin,Nikos Tzevelekos*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces YulToolkit, a tool based on game semantics to detect smart contract vulnerabilities precisely and effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts are prone to critical vulnerabilities, and detecting them accurately in real-world contracts remains a challenge.

Method: The approach utilizes bounded game semantics, modeling contract-environment interaction, and implements an exploration tool called YulToolkit designed for Yul, Solidity's intermediate language.

Result: YulToolkit successfully detected known vulnerabilities in real-world cases and benchmarks without reporting false positives after fixes.

Conclusion: Bounded game semantics exploration via YulToolkit enhances smart contract vulnerability detection, particularly for intricate issues like reentrancy.

Abstract: We present a new approach to finding smart contract vulnerabilities that is precise (no false positives up to our EVM-Yul interpreter), bounded-complete, and, when instrumented with domain knowledge, scales to real-world contracts. Our method is based on game semantics, modelling computation as an interaction between a contract and its environment, reducing reasoning about unknown or malicious external contracts to trace enumeration. We implement this in a tool we refer to as YulToolkit, a bounded game-semantics checker for Yul, the intermediate language of Solidity. By exploring only feasible interactions, YulToolkit avoids over-approximation, and by relying on the theory of game semantics it achieves bounded completeness. To make exploration tractable, YulToolkit supports instrumentation written in Solidity and propagated to Yul, comparable in effort to creating a test harness. Unlike tests, however, our technique explores all admissible traces within the chosen parameters and bounds. We evaluate YulToolkit on three real-world incidents: The DAO, PredyPool, and Lendf.Me, as well as benchmark contracts. In all cases, YulToolkit detects the known vulnerabilities (producing a violation-triggering trace), and after applying fixes, reports no further violations within bounds. These results show that bounded game semantics exploration is an effective and precise addition to the smart contract analysis toolbox, particularly for vulnerabilities such as reentrancy that are hard to detect precisely in real code.

### [487] [Compiling Gradual Types with Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22684)
*José Luis Romero,Cristóbal Isla,Matías Toro,Éric Tanter*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper explores the efficiency of evidence-based semantics for gradual typing by designing and evaluating a compiler, GrEv, showing competitive performance compared to coercion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradual typing implementations face challenges in efficiently supporting structural types and are limited in exploring alternative semantics like evidence-based approaches inspired by Abstracting Gradual Typing (AGT).

Method: The authors designed and implemented GrEv, an evidence-based compiler, focusing on bridging its formal semantics to practical implementation, and introducing novel monotonic semantics. Performance was evaluated using the Grift benchmark suite.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that GrEv performs competitively with coercion-based compilers, offering more stability across static-to-dynamic configurations.

Conclusion: An evidence-based approach is viable for efficient gradual typing implementation, opening doors for leveraging AGT-derived semantics in future compiler designs.

Abstract: Efficiently supporting sound gradual typing in a language with structural types is challenging. To date, the Grift compiler is the only close-to-the-metal implementation of gradual typing in this setting, exploiting coercions for runtime checks, and further extended with monotonic references for efficient access to statically-typed data structures. On the language design and semantics side, the Abstracting Gradual Typing (AGT) methodology has proven fruitful to elucidate existing designs and to innovate by deriving gradualizations of a wide variety of typing disciplines and language features. Grounded in abstract interpretation, the Curry-Howard inspired runtime semantics of AGT is based on the notion of evidence for consistent judgments that evolve during reduction, monitoring the plausibility of well-typedness. While expressive and versatile, it is unclear whether such evidence-based semantics are a viable route to realize an efficient implementation of gradual typing.
  In this work, we explore this question by designing, implementing, and evaluating an evidence-based compiler, called GrEv. We explain how to bridge the gap between the formal semantics and the GrEv compiler implementation, and identify novel monotonic semantics. We empirically evaluate the performance of GrEv on the Grift benchmark suite. The results show that an evidence-based compiler can be competitive with, and even faster than, a coercion-based compiler, exhibiting more stability across configurations on the static-to-dynamic spectrum. In addition to enriching the space of gradual typing compilers, this work opens a direct door to exploring efficient implementations of the many advanced gradual typing disciplines formally derived with AGT in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers need tools to handle constraints in software, hardware, and networks to ensure robustness in web applications.

Method: Chips combines control theory and programming language concepts to create robust component-based models, demonstrated using the Adaptable TeaStore application.

Result: A systematic approach to design, model, and analyze complex systems using Chips is provided.

Conclusion: Chips enables developers to create robust models for complex systems, improving web application design and functionality.

Abstract: When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks. Chips mixes notions  from control theory and general purpose programming languages to generate robust component-based models. This paper presents how to use Chips to systematically design, model and analyse a complex system project, using a variation of the Adaptable TeaStore application as running example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to illustrate the practical implementation of the Adaptable TeaStore as a reference model for adaptable microservice architectures and to evaluate the advantages and limitations of using AIOCJ, a choreographic language.

Method: The authors implement the Adaptable TeaStore using the AIOCJ language, which ensures correctness of communications and allows dynamic adaptations. They evaluate its runtime adaptability and analyze its applicability to real-world cloud systems.

Result: The implementation of the Adaptable TeaStore via AIOCJ demonstrates strong assurances for communication correctness and runtime adaptability. It also identifies current limitations of AIOCJ when applied to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The study confirms the potential of AIOCJ for building adaptable multiparty systems but highlights the need for refinements to better suit complex real-world cloud architectures.

Abstract: The Adaptable TeaStore has recently been proposed as a reference model for adaptable microservice architectures. It includes different configurations, as well as scenarios requiring to transition between them. We describe an implementation of the Adaptable TeaStore based on AIOCJ, a choreographic language that allows one to program multiparty systems that can adapt at runtime to different conditions. Following the choreographic tradition, AIOCJ ensures by-construction correctness of communications (e.g., no deadlocks) before, during, and after adaptation. Adaptation is dynamic, and the adaptation scenarios need to be fully specified only at runtime. Using AIOCJ to model the Adaptable TeaStore, we showcase the strengths of the approach and its current limitations, providing suggestions for future directions for refining the paradigm (and the AIOCJ language, in particular), to better align it with real-world Cloud architectures.

### [490] [Beyond Per-Thread Lock Sets: Multi-Thread Critical Sections and Dynamic Deadlock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23552)
*Martin Sulzmann*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Lock sets typically used in deadlock analysis often face inaccuracies due to thread restrictions in standard methods. This paper proposes a trace-based, multi-thread inclusive approach to improve precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic deadlock analysis encounter issues such as false positives and false negatives due to the single-thread focus in lock set construction. There is a need to address this limitation to enhance accuracy.

Method: The paper provides a trace-based characterization of critical sections that spans multiple threads and approximates it using partial order relations. This enables the development of an improved lock set construction that enhances existing deadlock predictors.

Result: The proposed approach reduces false positives (e.g., in DIRK) and false negatives (e.g., in SPDOffline) while maintaining soundness. Its integration with SPDOffline shows high precision without performance compromises.

Conclusion: The reformulated lock set construction addresses critical limitations in standard methods, offering a more precise and reliable approach to dynamic deadlock analysis, particularly for multi-thread scenarios.

Abstract: Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation.
  We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid programmers in analyzing NLP algorithms for properties such as runtime, space complexity, and identifying code issues like dead or redundant code.

Method: The proposed system is designed to infer key algorithm properties like types, redundancies, and complexity by applying it to various NLP algorithms.

Result: The system effectively identifies types, dead code, redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity for tested NLP algorithms.

Conclusion: The tool proves useful in assisting algorithm designers by providing necessary analyses and insights for developing efficient NLP algorithms.

Abstract: Much algorithmic research in NLP aims to efficiently manipulate rich formal structures. An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using UAVs and UGVs to optimize QoS in disaster areas while minimizing UAV usage through advanced positioning and trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently establish communication in disaster-affected areas while ensuring optimal Quality of Service and minimizing UAV deployment.

Method: A joint UAV-UGV positioning framework is designed using a road graph for UGV mobility. It employs an asynchronous A3C with meta-learning to solve the sum rate optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process.

Result: The Meta-A3C method achieves 13.1% higher throughput and 49% faster execution compared to A3C and DDPG, while meeting QoS requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed Meta-A3C framework is effective for rapid adaptation in dynamic disaster environments and ensures optimized communication quality efficiently.

Abstract: Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new navigation task (IION) that incorporates active dialog capabilities in agents for more realistic real-world scenarios, supported by a novel VL-LN benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world navigation often involves vague instructions requiring agents to infer user intent, which is not addressed in traditional navigation tasks.

Method: The proposed IION task combines navigation actions with language-based active dialog. VL-LN benchmark creates a large dataset with dialog-augmented trajectories and automatic evaluation protocols.

Result: Experiments reveal that dialog-enabled models trained with VL-LN show significant improvements compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VL-LN promotes advancements in dialog-enabled embodied navigation tasks, better aligning with real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In most existing embodied navigation tasks, instructions are well-defined and unambiguous, such as instruction following and object searching. Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of large, diverse human video datasets to pre-train vision-language-action (VLA) models and their transferability to robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with training solely on human videos, and the mapping between human and robot activities remains a fundamental challenge in robotics.

Method: The authors propose a simple co-training method to pre-train VLA models using a large variety of human and robot datasets.

Result: Their experiments show that sufficient pretraining on diverse tasks and scenes allows embodiment-agnostic representations to emerge, enabling human-to-robot skill transfer.

Conclusion: Pretraining VLA models with diverse robot datasets enables nearly double the performance on generalization tasks derived from human datasets, highlighting the value of large-scale, diverse training.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models can enable broad open world generalization, but require large and diverse datasets. It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.

Conclusion: Locust-inspired mechanisms enhance the reliability and robustness of collective motion in artificial swarms, particularly with visual sensing and motion control.

Abstract: In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.

### [497] [Asymmetric Friction in Geometric Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22484)
*Ross L. Hatton,Yousef Salaman,Shai Revzen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper extends the investigation of geometric mechanics for locomotion, incorporating asymmetric and anisotropic frictional drag via Finsler metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide insight into locomotion mechanisms where frictional drag is not only anisotropic but also asymmetric, enhancing understanding and modeling of real-world systems.

Method: The paper proposes a sub-Finslerian approach to construct motility maps, extending sub-Riemannian constraints to handle systems with asymmetric friction.

Result: The study identifies properties analogous to sub-Riemannian constraint curvature, offering insights into locomotion capabilities under asymmetric friction.

Conclusion: Introducing Finsler metrics to model asymmetric friction generalizes geometric mechanics and provides a framework for understanding more diverse locomotion systems.

Abstract: Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.
  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.

*Shen Changqing,Xu Bingzhou,Qi Bosong,Zhang Xiaojian,Yan Sijie,Ding Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy for robust and efficient ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping and a topology-preserving optimization method to enhance toolpath continuity and machining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining boundary conformity and eliminating zero-gradient singularities disrupting toolpath continuity and machining quality on complex surfaces.

Method: Employ conformal slit mapping to create an initial singularity-free scalar field, reformulate optimization as topology-preserving mesh deformation with boundary-synchronous updates.

Result: Proposed approach improves machining efficiency by 14.24%, scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces vibrations by over 10%, outperforming existing conformal slit mapping methods.

Conclusion: The strategy effectively ensures singularity-free, boundary-conforming toolpaths with broader implications for high-performance machining scenarios.

Abstract: Ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces is pivotal for high-quality and efficient machining of components in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes OBEYED-VLA, a framework enhancing Vision-Language-Action models by disentangling perception from action reasoning to improve robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current VLA models that entangle perception and control, resulting in poor grounding and overfitting in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposing OBEYED-VLA, which introduces an object-centric perception module to ground multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, geometry-aware observations for improved action reasoning.

Result: OBEYED-VLA outperforms VLA baselines in challenging manipulation tasks involving distractions, absent targets, and environmental clutter in real-world tests.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating object-centric and geometry-aware perception strengthens and generalizes VLA-based robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.
  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.
  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses the computational and informational perspective applied to bodies and argues against the notion that the primary role of bodies is computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore the evolutionary design of biological bodies and the optimal design of robotic bodies through the lens of information and computation, challenging the prevailing metaphor of bodies as computational entities.

Method: The approach involves examining biological bodies and nervous systems using principles of information theory and computation, and comparing these to robotic body designs to determine optimality.

Result: The paper suggests that applying computational and informational principles can provide insights into body evolution and design but concludes that bodies' primary purpose is not computation.

Conclusion: While computational and informational frameworks are useful, the role of bodies extends beyond computation, requiring a broader perspective.

Abstract: Applying the lens of computation and information has been instrumental in driving the technological progress of our civilization as well as in empowering our understanding of the world around us. The digital computer was and for many still is the leading metaphor for how our mind operates. Information theory (IT) has also been important in our understanding of how nervous systems encode and process information. The target article deploys information and computation to bodies: to understand why they have evolved in particular ways (animal bodies) and to design optimal bodies (robots). In this commentary, I argue that the main role of bodies is not to compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the limits and failures of Vision-Language-Action models through structured benchmarks and systematic analysis.

Method: A structured task framework is developed across three axes (Task Structure, Language Command, Visual Observation) to quantify difficulty; VLA-Arena includes 170 tasks with various dimensions and difficulty levels.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals critical limitations, such as tendencies toward memorization, weak generalization, lacking safety focus, and inability to handle complex tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Arena provides a thorough benchmark for analyzing Vision-Language-Action model weaknesses and aims to foster further research through its accessible tools and data resources.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time, collision-free robotic manipulation in dynamic, unknown environments while addressing challenges posed by frequent online replanning and perception updates.

Method: The framework integrates a GPU-enabled Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) for dense mapping and a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner for real-time motion generation. It uses an augmented robot-masked update to prevent false self-collisions and evaluates large-scale candidate motions in parallel.

Result: Validated effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator, demonstrating high-frequency replanning capabilities and robust performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GPU-accelerated system ensures efficient, real-time motion planning and collision avoidance in robotic manipulators, with broad utility in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time and collision-free motion planning remains challenging for robotic manipulation in unknown environments due to continuous perception updates and the need for frequent online replanning. To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

### [503] [Modeling of UAV Tether Aerodynamics for Real-Time Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22588)
*Max Beffert,Andreas Zell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes and compares analytical and numerical methods for real-time tether modeling of multirotor UAVs considering aerodynamic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multirotor UAVs are limited by battery power, and tethered operation offers a solution for continuous flight. Modeling tether forces, especially under challenging conditions like moving bases or high winds, is essential for practical deployment.

Method: Two tether modeling approaches were developed: (1) an analytical method based on catenary theory using uniform drag for fast computation (below 1ms); (2) a numerical method utilizing segment discretization and solving equilibrium equations with CasADi/IPOPT for higher accuracy and flexibility (5ms solve time).

Result: Both methods achieved real-time solve times and were validated through real-world tests measuring tether force. The analytical method balances computational efficiency with adequate accuracy, while the numerical method ensures greater physical fidelity for complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed tether modeling framework offers real-time capabilities for multi-rotor UAV operations, enabling applications in offline optimization, control, and trajectory planning, depending on the required trade-off between speed and accuracy.

Abstract: One of the main limitations of multirotor UAVs is their short flight time due to battery constraints. A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: The paper presents a coverage navigation system for non-holonomic robots for tasks like cleaning and material movement in industries, including mining, with tested results achieving around 90% area coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate coverage navigation tasks for improved safety and efficiency in industries like mining, where cleaning and material movement processes require precise area coverage.

Method: The system integrates route calculation for area coverage and includes recovery behaviors to handle unforeseen events like obstacles, ensuring evasive maneuvers and terrain post-recovery.

Result: In simulated and real outdoor environments, the system demonstrated effective navigation, achieving approximately 90% coverage in most experiments.

Conclusion: The system proves the concept's viability, with plans to scale the robot to industrial mining vehicles for real-world deployment and validation.

Abstract: In mobile robotics, coverage navigation refers to the deliberate movement of a robot with the purpose of covering a certain area or volume. Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods within the learning from demonstrations paradigm to infer unknown environmental constraints using fewer but informational demonstrations.

Method: The paper introduces an iterative active constraint learning algorithm that uses Gaussian processes. It queries start/goal states to generate demonstrations, which are refined iteratively for better constraint learning.

Result: The proposed method shows superior performance in accurately inferring unknown constraints in both simulations and real-world experiments, compared to random-sampling-based methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging informative demonstrations and Gaussian processes, the iterative method successfully infers constraints with fewer data, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We present an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm, within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm, which intelligently solicits informative demonstration trajectories for inferring an unknown constraint in the demonstrator's environment. Our approach iteratively trains a Gaussian process (GP) on the available demonstration dataset to represent the unknown constraints, uses the resulting GP posterior to query start/goal states, and generates informative demonstrations which are added to the dataset. Across simulation and hardware experiments using high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics and unknown nonlinear constraints, our method outperforms a baseline, random-sampling based method at accurately performing constraint inference from an iteratively generated set of sparse but informative demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved computational structure of two autonomous robots in the Look-Compute-Move model, filling a gap in the broader understanding of multi-robot systems.

Method: A simulation-free approach is used to derive equivalences and separations across different robot models (OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI) and scheduler types (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, etc.).

Result: Key findings include the surprising equivalence of FSTA^F and LUMI^F under perfect synchrony and the orthogonality between FSTA and FCOM, showing a bidirectional incomparability.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive computational landscape for two autonomous robots, revealing fundamental differences from the general multi-robot case and intrinsic coordination challenges at this minimal scale.

Abstract: The computational power of autonomous mobile robots under the Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model has been widely studied through an extensive hierarchy of robot models defined by the presence of memory, communication, and synchrony assumptions. While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with redundancy and unpredictability in parallel mechanism inverse kinematics, especially when targets are outside of the workspace.

Method: P-FABRIK uses a novel decomposition strategy to break parallel mechanisms into serial sub-chains, iteratively solving for inverse kinematics through a modified FABRIK algorithm.

Result: The algorithm proved effective across diverse test cases, showing general applicability, efficiency, and robustness in handling out-of-workspace targets.

Conclusion: P-FABRIK provides a general, robust, and computationally efficient inverse kinematics solution suitable for a variety of parallel mechanisms.

Abstract: Traditional geometric inverse kinematics methods for parallel mechanisms rely on specific spatial geometry constraints. However, their application to redundant parallel mechanisms is challenged due to the increased constraint complexity. Moreover, it will output no solutions and cause unpredictable control problems when the target pose lies outside its workspace. To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively. Multiple case studies involving planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrated the proposed method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms. Furthermore, numerical simulation studies verified its efficacy and computational efficiency, as well as its robustness ability to handle out-of-workspace targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing precise and robust motion control for aerial manipulators is highly challenging due to significant dynamic coupling between the multirotor base and the robotic arm.

Method: The method uses variable-gain ESOs to estimate dynamic coupling in real-time and a prescribed performance control strategy with error trajectory constraints to ensure high tracking precision.

Result: Experiments validate the method's effectiveness in handling dynamic coupling and aggressive robotic arm motions (e.g., end-effector velocity of 1.02 m/s and acceleration of 5.10 m/s$^2$), demonstrating high tracking accuracy in tasks such as aerial staff twirling and cart pulling.

Conclusion: The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of PreGME in achieving precise and robust motion control in dynamic and high-demand aerial manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents MoVLR, a framework utilizing vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between movement goals described in language and effective motor control for high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively discovering reward functions for musculoskeletal motor control is challenging due to the implicit nature of control strategies, despite explicit descriptions of goals like walking or posture.

Method: The authors propose MoVLR, which employs VLMs for iterative exploration of the reward space through interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, enabling alignment with physically coordinated behaviors.

Result: MoVLR enables the transformation of visual and language-based assessments into structured guidance for learning reward functions in high-dimensional locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs can ground abstract motion descriptions into principles for physiological motor control, supporting more effective reward function discovery and control strategies.

Abstract: Discovering effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in motor control of high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems. While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as "walking forward with an upright posture," the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.

Abstract: High-quality visualizations are an essential part of robotics research, enabling clear communication of results through figures, animations, and demonstration videos. While Blender is a powerful and freely available 3D graphics platform, its steep learning curve and lack of robotics-focused integrations make it difficult and time-consuming for researchers to use effectively. In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks. The library offers three primary capabilities: (1) importing robots and environments directly from standardized descriptions such as URDF; (2) Python-based scripting tools for keyframing robot states and visual attributes; and (3) convenient generation of primitive 3D shapes for schematic figures and animations. Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise. We demonstrate the library through a series of proof-of-concept examples and conclude with a discussion of current limitations and opportunities for future extensions.

### [512] [Beyond URDF: The Universal Robot Description Directory for Shared, Extensible, and Standardized Robot Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23135)
*Roshan Klein-Seetharaman,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a rich, modular format for robot descriptions that improves standardization and streamlines downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot specification files lack detailed derived information, causing redundancy and inefficiencies in processes like simulation and planning.

Method: The authors propose URDDs, modular structures generated from URDFs using an open-source toolkit, implemented in Rust, and provide visualization aids like Bevy and JavaScript/Three.js.

Result: Experiments show URDDs efficiently encapsulate richer information and support constructing essential robotics subroutines.

Conclusion: URDDs reduce redundancy and propose shared standards for robotics frameworks, while the paper discusses limitations and implications for broader adoption.

Abstract: Robots are typically described in software by specification files (e.g., URDF, SDF, MJCF, USD) that encode only basic kinematic, dynamic, and geometric information. As a result, downstream applications such as simulation, planning, and control must repeatedly re-derive richer data, leading to redundant computations, fragmented implementations, and limited standardization. In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines. URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations and implications of our work.

### [513] [A New Software Tool for Generating and Visualizing Robot Self-Collision Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23140)
*Roshan Klein-Seetharama,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive tool for dynamic generation and visualization of self-collision matrices for robot states, overcoming limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address existing constraints in robotics tools that generate self-collision matrices, such as lack of dynamic inspection, rigid assumptions, and cumbersome workflows, thereby improving flexibility and usability.

Method: The tool is implemented in Rust using the Bevy game engine and supports multiple shape representations for dynamic visualization, inspection, filtering, and refinement. Outputs are provided in JSON and YAML formats.

Result: Demonstrated on various robots, the tool generates self-collision matrices with enhanced accuracy and faster results for self-collision and self-proximity queries.

Conclusion: The system streamlines the generation and refinement of self-collision matrices, offering significant advantages over current tools, especially in dynamic and flexible robotics applications.

Abstract: In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a specialized framework using the SPL dataset to systematically evaluate descriptor robustness for reliable landmark identification under challenging conditions in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable identification of pole-like structures in large-scale urban environments is challenging due to degraded observation reliability under Pole-at-Distance conditions.

Method: An automated tracking-based association pipeline constructs the SPL dataset. The study evaluates landmark retrieval performance through a comparison of Contrastive Learning and Supervised Learning paradigms.

Result: Contrastive Learning is shown to induce a more robust feature space, particularly effective for distances in the 5--10m range.

Conclusion: The framework and findings offer a scalable methodology and empirical basis for assessing landmark distinctiveness in complex urban scenarios.

Abstract: While pole-like structures are widely recognized as stable geometric anchors for long-term robot localization, their identification reliability degrades significantly under Pole-at-Distance (Pad) observations typical of large-scale urban environments. This paper shifts the focus from descriptor design to a systematic investigation of descriptor robustness. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a specialized evaluation framework centered on the Small Pole Landmark (SPL) dataset. This dataset is constructed via an automated tracking-based association pipeline that captures multi-view, multi-distance observations of the same physical landmarks without manual annotation. Using this framework, we present a comparative analysis of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms. Our findings reveal that CL induces a more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in the 5--10m range. This work provides an empirical foundation and a scalable methodology for evaluating landmark distinctiveness in challenging real-world scenarios.

Result: The study confirmed the robot’s ability to perform logistical tasks with minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: A multi-limbed robot offers a promising solution to help astronauts manage logistical operations autonomously on the ISS, improving efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study, including simulations and prototype tests, on the autonomous operation of a multi-limbed intra-vehicular robot (mobile manipulator), shortly MLIVR, designed to assist astronauts with logistical tasks on the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts spend significant time on tasks such as preparation, close-out, and the collection and transportation of goods, reducing the time available for critical mission activities. Our study explores the potential for a mobile manipulator to support these operations, emphasizing the need for autonomous functionality to minimize crew and ground operator effort while enabling real-time task execution. We focused on the robot's transportation capabilities, simulating its motion planning in 3D space. The actual motion execution was tested with a prototype on a 2D table to mimic a microgravity environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of performing these tasks with minimal human intervention, offering a promising solution to enhance operational efficiency on the ISS.

*Keigo Torii,Kentaro Uno,Shreya Santra,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new design for a modular robot coupling mechanism that meets specific requirements for use in extreme environments, such as space, including single-sided coupling/decoupling and compatibility with passive interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coupling mechanisms for modular robots are inadequate for extreme environmental applications, requiring innovations to meet complex design specifications like single-sided operations and structural versatility.

Method: The study proposes a shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism which transitions between male and female states in a controlled, sequential manner to achieve single-sided coupling and decoupling.

Result: The mechanism enables efficient coupling and decoupling in modular robotic systems, providing compatibility with passive coupling interfaces while maintaining flat surfaces when uncoupled.

Conclusion: The introduced coupling mechanism fulfills essential requirements for heterogeneous structural-module integration and offers significant versatility for modular robots and robotic tool changers.

Abstract: Lattice-based modular robot systems are envisioned for large-scale construction in extreme environments, such as space. Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SurgWorld, a platform that generates realistic surgical training data using world modeling, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving autonomous surgical robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of paired visual and kinematic data in surgical robotics prevents effective training of autonomous systems, despite the abundance of unlabeled surgical videos.

Method: The authors developed SurgWorld, using the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset and generative world modeling, enabling the creation of diverse and realistic synthetic surgical videos with pseudokinematics inferred by an inverse dynamics model.

Result: The surgical VLA policy trained on synthetic data from SurgWorld outperformed models trained exclusively on real-world demonstrations when tested on a real surgical robot platform.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable solution for autonomous surgical skill acquisition, leveraging generative modeling and unlabeled surgical videos, offering improved generalizability and data efficiency.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

*Qin Wang,Shanmin Pang,Jianwu Fang,Shengye Dong,Fuhao Liu,Jianru Xue,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach to enhance human-vehicle interaction by prioritizing driver intention and state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap towards fully autonomous driving by improving driver trust, acceptance, and interaction with autonomous systems.

Method: The proposed method focuses on two levels: 1) trajectory planning using an intention-aware approach at the tactical level and 2) reinforcement learning-based control authority allocation at the operational level.

Result: Simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the method effectively aligns with driver intentions, ensures better authority allocation, and outperforms other cooperative driving approaches in reducing human-machine conflicts.

Conclusion: The HOCD approach improves both driving performance and human-machine cooperation, fostering smoother transitions towards autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the mUDAI method for optimizing UAV path planning for inspections of scattered Regions of Interest (ROIs), improving efficiency while maintaining data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in UAV-based inspection tasks, particularly when inspecting multiple non-connected ROIs, due to battery and data collection constraints.

Method: Authors propose the mUDAI method, a two-fold optimization procedure that determines optimal image capturing positions and UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution with operational efficiency.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests show improved operational efficiency and high-quality data capture using the mUDAI method.

Conclusion: The method is effective for rapid inspections of scattered ROIs in various applications, with open-source resources provided for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483). Finally, this online platform (https://sites.google.com/view/mudai-platform/) allows interested readers to interact with the mUDAI method and generate their own multi UAV FISR missions.

*Sheng-Kai Chen,Yi-Ling Tsai,Chun-Chih Chang,Yan-Chen Chen,Po-Chiang Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper integrates explainability methods with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation to improve the transparency and safety of inverse kinematics (IK) solutions for robot manipulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for transparent and responsible AI-driven solutions for robot manipulators, especially inverse-kinematics models, to comply with safety and regulatory standards while ensuring high performance.

Method: The paper introduces an explainability framework using Shapley-value attribution combined with physics-based evaluations for obstacle avoidance in robotic systems. Two variants of IKNet are trained on synthetic data, analyzed with SHAP rankings and visualizations, and tested against physical obstacle clearance measures in simulators.

Result: Insights from global and local attribution rankings reveal that architectures that balance importance across pose dimensions tend to achieve safer trajectory metrics without sacrificing positional accuracy. Qualitative heat maps support these results.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that explainable AI techniques are vital in exposing failure modes, improving architectures, and guiding safer, obstacle-aware designs for IK algorithms, contributing toward responsible AI deployment in robotics.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.

Result: Evaluation on the KITTI dataset showed significant ATE RMSE and ATE median improvements in certain sequences but mixed performance overall, reflecting scenario dependence.

Conclusion: The study offers solutions for dynamic object filtering in vSLAM systems, revealing both benefits and limitations in achieving robust navigation in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient agent allocation algorithm for collective systems with non-linear performance scalability in tasks, validated via robot simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of brute-force methods in agent-task allocation when tasks differ in scalability, and to improve collective performance.

Method: Developed a computational algorithm based on marginal performance gains, tested with robot swarms in simulated decision-making tasks.

Result: Algorithm efficiently allocated agents among tasks with various scaling behaviors, confirming its utility in varied scenarios.

Conclusion: This algorithm facilitates optimal agent-task allocations in systems with non-linear performance scaling, advancing the implementation of real-world multi-robot systems.

Abstract: In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.

*Marie Bauer,Julia Gachot,Matthias Kerzel,Cornelius Weber,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Theory of Mind (ToM) with Explainable AI (XAI) in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to make robots better at understanding human mental states and providing user-centered explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to better adapt to human interactions by understanding human mental states and providing explanations that align with users’ perspectives. Current XAI lacks user-centered explanations, creating a need to incorporate ToM into XAI frameworks.

Method: The authors align ToM with the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its desiderata, promoting user-centric explanations. They propose embedding ToM principles to assess and improve how robots explain their reasoning during interactions.

Result: The proposed integration highlights how user-centered explanations derived from ToM could address the gap in current XAI in HRI, making robots more interpretable and adaptive to human needs.

Conclusion: Integrating ToM with XAI frameworks could shift the focus from system-centered to user-centered explanations, improving human-robot interactions and enabling robots to meet informational needs effectively.

Abstract: Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper tackles control frameworks for electrified heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) focusing on simplifying design and safely integrating AI for autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address transitions in HDMMs from diesel-hydraulic systems to cleaner electric systems and increased autonomy amidst safety and performance challenges.

Method: A generic modular control framework is proposed, along with hierarchical policies blending partial AI integration while guaranteeing safety, validated through three case studies in diverse conditions.

Result: Validated control solutions demonstrate robustness, responsiveness, and compatibility with international safety standards, published in five peer-reviewed studies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully supports the electrification and autonomy transition by resolving technical, economic, and safety obstacles in HDMM design and operation.

Abstract: Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.
  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.
  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.
  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing goal-conditioned policies in handling long-horizon robotic tasks effectively.

Method: Act2Goal combines a goal-conditioned visual world model with Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), generating intermediate states for executing long-horizon tasks and enabling fine-grained and global control.

Result: Act2Goal demonstrates a significant improvement in real-robot manipulation success rates from 30% to 90%, with stronger zero-shot generalization to new scenarios and reward-free online adaptation.

Conclusion: The approach highlights goal-conditioned world models and temporal control frameworks as effective structuring tools for robotic manipulation tasks, enabling enhanced adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

We first detail the design and fabrication of the Sumbrella, including sequenced origami-inspired bistable units, fabric pneumatic actuation chambers, cable driven shape morphing mechanisms, computer vision components, and an integrated wearable system comprising a hat and bolero jacket housing power and control electronics. Through a focus group with twelve creative technologists, we then used Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore how people interpreted, interacted, and imagined future relationships with soft robotic wearables. While Sumbrella allowed our participants to engage in rich discussion around speculative futures and expressive potential, it also surfaced concerns about exploitation, surveillance, and the personal risks and societal ethics of embedding biosensing technologies in public life. We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines. Finally, we provide a reflection on our application of speculative design; proposing that it allows HRI researchers to not only consider functionality, but also how wearable robots influence definitions of what is considered acceptable or desirable in public settings.

*Dat Le,Thomas Manhardt,Moritz Venator,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops an unsupervised learning framework using Deep Isolation Forest (DIF) for detecting rare hazardous driving scenarios in autonomous systems, with effective results based on naturalistic driving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of detecting rare and hazardous driving scenarios for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems.

Method: The approach utilizes Deep Isolation Forest (DIF) as an anomaly detection algorithm, preprocessing perception module data into structured statistical features, applying t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, and conducting evaluations using proxy ground truth with quantitative and qualitative methods.

Result: The framework effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data, demonstrating scalability in anomaly detection for autonomous systems.

Conclusion: Though effective, the method's reliance on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations limits its ability to capture the full spectrum of contextual real-world driving anomalies.

Abstract: The detection of rare and hazardous driving scenarios is a critical challenge for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.

### [528] [A Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observer for Steer-by-Wire Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23593)
*Nikolai Beving,Jonas Marxen,Steffen Mueller,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer for Steer-by-Wire systems to accurately estimate high-frequency driver-induced torque disturbances, relying solely on motor state measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods for mitigating high-frequency driver-induced torque disturbances in Steer-by-Wire systems, particularly the cost and impracticality of direct torque sensors and the inability of existing approaches to capture high-frequency disturbances.

Method: Developed and evaluated a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer to estimate high-frequency driver torque. Driver torque was modeled as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation, and integrated into linear and nonlinear system models. Simulations compared different Kalman filter types including linear and nonlinear designs.

Result: The disturbance observer accurately reconstructed driver-induced disturbances with minimal delay (14ms). The nonlinear extended Kalman filter performed better than the linear filter in handling frictional nonlinearities and dynamic transitions.

Conclusion: The proposed Kalman filter-based disturbance observer is effective in addressing high-frequency driver torque disturbances in Steer-by-Wire systems. However, its robustness in real-world driving conditions requires further study.

Abstract: Steer-by-Wire systems replace mechanical linkages, which provide benefits like weight reduction, design flexibility, and compatibility with autonomous driving. However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.

*Christoph Willibald,Lugh Martensen,Thomas Eiband,Dongheui Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intuitive robot programming method for non-experts to enable robots to perform surface finishing tasks in small-scale settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic systems are challenging to set up and program, requiring expertise, which limits their application in tasks with high variability and small batch sizes, especially in surface finishing for craft and small-scale manufacturing.

Method: The authors developed a surface segmentation algorithm with human input and iterative visual feedback that allows users to identify and refine workpiece areas. This leads to the generation of robot trajectories for task execution. Extensive user studies were conducted to evaluate and refine interaction designs.

Result: The proposed interface reduced user workload, enhanced usability, and enabled effective robot programming for users with limited experience.

Conclusion: The approach makes robot programming more accessible to non-experts, allowing collaborative robots to be used effectively for surface finishing in craft and small-scale manufacturing.

Abstract: Lengthy setup processes that require robotics expertise remain a major barrier to deploying robots for tasks involving high product variability and small batch sizes. As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.

### [530] [The N-5 Scaling Law: Topological Dimensionality Reduction in the Optimal Design of Fully-actuated Multirotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23619)
*Antonio Franchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates the geometry and topology of optimization landscapes for designing omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles, revealing a relationship between rotor configurations and chassis symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intrinsic optimization topology beyond traditional parametric methods in the design of omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles.

Method: The design problem is reformulated on a product manifold of projective lines using a Log-Volume isotropy metric, analyzing rotor orientations in relation to chassis symmetries and topologies.

Result: Finds that the optimal configuration topology depends on chassis symmetry: from discrete points in irregular formations to multi-dimensional solutions for regular geometries with an empirical N-5 scaling law.

Conclusion: Revealed a design topology enabling morphing capabilities in rotor configurations while maintaining control optimality, offering new insights into optimal designs of rotor vehicles.

Abstract: The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.

### [531] [RoboMirror: Understand Before You Imitate for Video to Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23649)
*Zhe Li,Cheng Chi,Yangyang Wei,Boan Zhu,Tao Huang,Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Fangzhou Liu,Chang Xu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboMirror, a novel video-to-locomotion framework utilizing VLMs for understanding visual motion intents and generating humanoid locomotion without pose reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion systems are limited by their reliance on predefined motion trajectories or sparse commands, lacking a deeper integration of visual understanding with control.

Method: RoboMirror leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to process videos and generate motion intents which condition a diffusion-based policy for semantically aligned and physically plausible locomotion.

Result: Experiments show the framework reduces control latency by 80%, improves task success rates by 3.7%, and allows telepresence using egocentric videos.

Conclusion: RoboMirror successfully bridges the gap between video understanding and humanoid locomotion, paving the way for more adaptive and visually-aware robotic systems.

Abstract: Humans learn locomotion through visual observation, interpreting visual content first before imitating actions. However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.

*Zhe Li,Cheng Chi,Yangyang Wei,Boan Zhu,Tao Huang,Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Fangzhou Liu,Chang Xu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboPerform, a unified framework for generating music-driven dance and speech-driven gestures directly from audio for humanoid robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing robot motion systems that rely on predefined actions or explicit motion reconstruction, often resulting in errors, latency, and disjointed audio-motion alignment.

Method: The framework adopts a retargeting-free design using a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy to add audio-driven style. Audio is treated as an implicit style signal, bypassing explicit motion reconstruction.

Result: RoboPerform ensures low latency, high fidelity, and generates physically plausible and audio-aligned robotic motions, allowing robots to perform responsively to music and speech.

Conclusion: RoboPerform successfully transforms humanoid robots into performers capable of expressive, audio-driven movements, overcoming traditional limitations in motion generation.

Abstract: Humans intuitively move to sound, but current humanoid robots lack expressive improvisational capabilities, confined to predefined motions or sparse commands. Generating motion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of "motion = content + style", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio.

### [533] [The Bulldozer Technique: Efficient Elimination of Local Minima Traps for APF-Based Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23672)
*Mohammed Baziyad,Manal Al Shohna,Tamer Rabie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Bulldozer technique, which solves the local minima problem in path planning for autonomous robots, outperforming conventional and advanced methods while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the local minima trap problem in Artificial Potential Field (APF) path planning methods for autonomous robots.

Method: Proposed the Bulldozer technique with backfilling and ramp-based enhancements to eliminate local minima and ensure smooth robot navigation.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated that the Bulldozer technique solves local minima issues, surpasses conventional methods in speed, and offers competitive path quality.

Conclusion: The Bulldozer technique resolves local minima challenges effectively while enabling fast and smooth robot navigation, proving suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in reinforcement learning for robotics, focusing on designing effective reward functions, and introduces Dopamine-Reward and Dopamine-RL to overcome these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the issues in applying reinforcement learning for robotics due to ineffective reward functions and theoretical shortcomings in current approaches.

Method: The paper introduces Dopamine-Reward, a method incorporating a General Reward Model (GRM) leveraging step-wise reward discretization and multi-perspective reward fusion, as well as Dopamine-RL, a framework with policy-invariant reward shaping.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment and significantly improves policy learning efficiency, showcasing strong generalization after one-shot task adaptation.

Conclusion: Dopamine-Reward and Dopamine-RL provide an effective solution for reward modeling and policy learning, enabling efficient self-improvement and reliable performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

### [535] [Syntax Is Not Enough: An Empirical Study of Small Transformer Models for Neural Code Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22216)
*Shaunak Samant*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Small transformer models struggle with repairing real-world Java bugs despite high syntactic validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the practical feasibility of using small neural models to repair Java code errors and assess syntactic correctness as a proxy for semantic correctness.

Method: Fine-tuning CodeT5-small model with 60.5M parameters on Java bug-fix pairs extracted from CodeXGLUE, followed by evaluation of both token-level and syntactic validity.

Result: The model achieved ninety-four percent syntactic validity but zero percent exact matches in repairs, reproducing buggy input verbatim eighty percent of the time.

Conclusion: Current small transformer models are overly focused on syntactic accuracy but lack semantic understanding, limiting their practical use in automated program repair.

Abstract: Automated program repair using neural models has shown promising results on benchmark datasets, yet practical deployment remains limited. In this study, we examine whether a small transformer model can meaningfully repair real-world Java bugs and whether syntactic correctness is a reliable proxy for semantic correctness.
  We fine-tune CodeT5-small (60.5M parameters) on 52,364 Java bug-fix pairs from CodeXGLUE and evaluate both token-level performance and syntactic validity using AST parsing. While the model converges cleanly and achieves high grammatical correctness, producing syntactically valid Java code in approximately ninety-four percent of cases, it fails to generate correct repairs under exact-match evaluation, achieving zero exact matches. In approximately eighty percent of cases, the model reproduces the buggy input verbatim.

### [536] [Failure Analysis of Safety Controllers in Autonomous Vehicles Under Object-Based LiDAR Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22244)
*Daniyal Ganiuly,Nurzhau Bolatbek,Assel Smaiyl*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of LiDAR-based object spoofing attacks on the safety controllers of autonomous vehicles, showing how these attacks lead to unsafe and unstable behaviors in car-following and cut-in scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how adversarial attacks on LiDAR perception impact critical safety functions like adaptive cruise control and emergency braking in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Using a high-fidelity simulation framework, the study integrates LiDAR perception, object tracking, and vehicle control to analyze vehicle behavior under adversarial LiDAR-based attacks in highway scenarios.

Result: The paper finds that short-duration LiDAR-induced object hallucinations lead to unsafe braking, delay in hazard responses, and unstable control. Temporal consistency of spoofed objects has a stronger impact on failures than spatial inaccuracies.

Conclusion: Current LiDAR perception systems show a gap in ensuring safety at the controller level under attacks. The paper emphasizes the need for safety mechanisms and resilient control strategies to address these vulnerabilities in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.

### [537] [Hallucination Detection for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation via Two-Stage Metamorphic Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22250)
*Bo Yang,Yinfen Xia,Weisong Sun,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents SQLHD, a hallucination detection method for Text-to-SQL tasks using metamorphic testing, achieving superior results without requiring ground-truth SQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models in Text-to-SQL tasks generate hallucinations, causing incorrect SQL queries and impacting downstream applications. Existing error detection methods are insufficient due to a lack of ground-truth data.

Method: SQLHD employs metamorphic testing to identify hallucinations in two stages: schema-linking and logical-synthesis. Eight structure-aware and nine logic-aware metamorphic relations are used to detect anomalies without requiring ground-truth SQL.

Result: Experimental results show SQLHD achieves an F1-score ranging from 69.36% to 82.76%, outperforming LLM Self-Evaluation methods in identifying hallucinations.

Conclusion: SQLHD effectively detects hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks, showing it is a promising method for improving the reliability of LLM-generated SQL without relying on standard answers.

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL generation, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization and adaptability. However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance in terms of the F1-score, which ranges from 69.36\% to 82.76\%. Additionally, SQLHD demonstrates superior performance over LLM Self-Evaluation methods, effectively identifying hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of real-world software issue resolution, which demands long-term reasoning, iterative exploration, and feedback-driven decisions, by leveraging advancements in LLM-based agentic systems.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic survey of 126 recent studies, categorizing the research into a taxonomy of benchmarks, techniques, and empirical studies related to LLM-based approaches for software issue resolution.

Result: The survey finds that recent advancements, especially agentic reinforcement learning, have shifted paradigms in designing agentic systems for software engineering, improving efficiency and validating AI systems in reasoning, planning, and execution.

Conclusion: LLM-based agentic systems hold transformative potential for software issue resolution, but there are key challenges and promising research directions that need exploration to advance this field further.

Abstract: Software issue resolution aims to address real-world issues in software repositories (e.g., bug fixing and efficiency optimization) based on natural language descriptions provided by users, representing a key aspect of software maintenance. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning and generative capabilities, LLM-based approaches have made significant progress in automated software issue resolution. However, real-world software issue resolution is inherently complex and requires long-horizon reasoning, iterative exploration, and feedback-driven decision making, which demand agentic capabilities beyond conventional single-step approaches. Recently, LLM-based agentic systems have become mainstream for software issue resolution. Advancements in agentic software issue resolution not only greatly enhance software maintenance efficiency and quality but also provide a realistic environment for validating agentic systems' reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, bridging artificial intelligence and software engineering.
  This work presents a systematic survey of 126 recent studies at the forefront of LLM-based agentic software issue resolution research. It outlines the general workflow of the task and establishes a taxonomy across three dimensions: benchmarks, techniques, and empirical studies. Furthermore, it highlights how the emergence of agentic reinforcement learning has brought a paradigm shift in the design and training of agentic systems for software engineering. Finally, it summarizes key challenges and outlines promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper studies the reproducibility of code generated by Large Language Models, showing only 68.3% execution success and identifying hidden dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the real-world reproducibility and dependencies of code generated by LLMs in clean environments.

Method: Empirical study evaluating three LLMs across 300 projects generated from 100 prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java; introduced a dependency framework.

Result: 68.3% of projects execute successfully; Python has the highest success rate (89.2%), Java the lowest (44.0%). 13.5 times more runtime dependencies than declared were identified.

Conclusion: LLM-generated code has limited reproducibility due to hidden dependencies, with notable variation across programming languages.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding agents promises to accelerate software development, but their impact on generated code reproducibility remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study investigating whether LLM-generated code can be executed successfully in a clean environment with only OS packages and using only the dependencies that the model specifies. We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLM coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini) across 300 projects generated from 100 standardized prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java. We introduce a three-layer dependency framework (distinguishing between claimed, working, and runtime dependencies) to quantify execution reproducibility. Our results show that only 68.3% of projects execute out-of-the-box, with substantial variation across languages (Python 89.2%, Java 44.0%). We also find a 13.5 times average expansion from declared to actual runtime dependencies, revealing significant hidden dependencies.

*Yi-Hung Chou,Boyuan Jiang,Yi Wen Chen,Mingyue Weng,Victoria Jackson,Thomas Zimmermann,James A. Jones*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines 'vibe coding,' where developers use prompts to build software with large language models (LLMs), analyzing behaviors, strategies, and challenges from 20 coding session videos and their impact on software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the emerging phenomenon of 'vibe coding,' its practices, and how it is transforming software engineering with the use of AI-powered LLMs.

Method: The researchers conducted a grounded theory study on 20 vibe-coding videos (7 live-streams and 13 opinion videos), analyzing 16 hours of coding sessions, their prompts, and behaviors.

Result: Vibe coders demonstrate a spectrum of behaviors ranging from heavy reliance on AI to active adaptation of outputs. They face challenges such as uncertainty in AI output ('rolling the dice') and showcase diverse prompting strategies based on experience.

Conclusion: This study contributes to understanding how AI is transforming software engineering practices, offering insights for tool design, education, and future research on the role of LLMs in coding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping software engineering by enabling "vibe coding," in which developers build software primarily through prompts rather than writing code. Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as "rolling the dice." Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust.

### [541] [GraphLocator: Graph-guided Causal Reasoning for Issue Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22469)
*Wei Liu,Chao Peng,Pengfei Gao,Aofan Liu,Wei Zhang,Haiyan Zhao,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GraphLocator addresses the semantic gap in issue localization in software repositories by creating causal issue graphs, showing significant improvement in accuracy and performance compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the semantic gap in issue localization caused by symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatches in automated software engineering.

Method: GraphLocator introduces a causal issue graph to map issues and their dependencies, consisting of symptom vertex identification and dynamic graph expansion phases.

Result: GraphLocator achieves 19.49% higher recall and 11.89% higher precision compared to baselines, effectively handling mismatch scenarios with significant recall and precision improvements.

Conclusion: GraphLocator improves issue localization accuracy and downstream task performance through innovative causal structure discovery and dynamic issue disentangling.

Abstract: The issue localization task aims to identify the locations in a software repository that requires modification given a natural language issue description. This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively. (3) The CIG generated by GraphLocator yields the highest relative improvement, resulting in a 28.74% increase in performance on downstream resolving task.

### [542] [Isolating Compiler Faults via Multiple Pairs of Adversarial Compilation Configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22538)
*Qingyang Li,Yibiao Yang,Maolin Sun,Jiangchang Wu,Qingkai Shi,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study introduces "MultiConf," a fault localization approach for compilers, leveraging adversarial compilation configurations and Spectrum-Based Fault Localization to efficiently and effectively identify source file faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern compilers makes identifying and localizing faults in their source files a difficult yet critical task for software reliability.

Method: MultiConf generates adversarial compilation configuration pairs (failing and passing), uses Spectrum-Based Fault Localization for ranking suspicious files, and aggregates individual rankings via a weighted voting scheme.

Result: MultiConf localized 27 out of 60 real GCC compiler bugs at the Top-1 file level, outperforming two state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of 35.0% and 28.6%.

Conclusion: MultiConf is a robust and effective method for automating fault localization in compiler infrastructures, showing significant advancements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Compilers are fundamental to modern software development, making the effective identification and resolution of compiler faults essential. However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively.

*Woorim Han,Yeongjun Kwak,Miseon Yu,Kyeongmin Kim,Younghan Lee,Hyungon Moon,Yunheung Paek*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the effectiveness of learning-based automated vulnerability repair models, addressing their limitations in generalization and evaluation metrics, and introduces a new benchmark to improve assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether state-of-the-art learning-based AVR models can truly generalize to unseen vulnerabilities and understand their reliance on flawed metrics and training data splits.

Method: The study employs semantic transformations to assess model robustness, re-splits datasets for unbiased evaluations, and creates L-AVRBench to enhance benchmark reliability.

Result: The findings revealed that existing AVR models struggle with overfitting, lack generalization capabilities, and are limited by current evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Current fine-tuned AVR models need improved datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks like L-AVRBench to address their limitations in unseen vulnerability repairs.

Abstract: Learning-based automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques that utilize fine-tuned language models have shown promise in generating vulnerability patches. However, questions remain about their ability to repair unseen vulnerabilities. Our empirical study reveals that state-of-the-art models often overfit to the training set and are evaluated using training, validation, and test sets that are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art fine-tuned AVR models and the adequacy of match-based evaluation metrics in three ways. First, we apply semantic-preserving transformations to test sets in order to determine whether models truly learn robust vulnerability-repair patterns or simply rely on spurious features. Second, we re-split the training, validation, and test sets to be mutually exclusive and evaluate the models on the revised test set to assess their generalization capabilities. Third, we introduce L-AVRBench, a test-based benchmark tailored for learning-based AVR, to overcome the limitations of match-based metrics and examine the AVR models' true repair capabilities.

*Sabine Houy,Bruno Kreyssig,Alexandre Bartel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CFIghter enables strict, type-based CFI in real-world C/C++ projects through automated detection, classification, and repair of policy violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compiler-based Control-Flow Integrity is strong but difficult to deploy due to visibility mismatches and unintended failures in large C/C++ projects.

Method: CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis, guided runtime monitoring, and iterative adjustments to CFI enforcement based on test suite results.

Result: CFIghter resolves all build errors, repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations, and retains strict enforcement for 89% of control-flow sites.

Conclusion: CFIghter makes strict compiler-based CFI deployable in modular C software without manual source-code intervention.

Abstract: Compiler-based Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) offers strong forward-edge protection but remains challenging to deploy in large C/C++ software due to visibility mismatches, type inconsistencies, and unintended behavioral failures. We present CFIghter, the first fully automated system that enables strict, type-based CFI in real-world projects by detecting, classifying, and repairing unintended policy violations exposed by the test suite. CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary. These results show that automated compatibility repair makes strict compiler CFI practically deployable in mature, modular C software.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how publicly available LLMs can be manipulated into generating working exploits, fundamentally disrupting traditional security assumptions in software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the security implications of large language models (LLMs) making software creation accessible to novices, including malicious actors.

Method: Using RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation) to manipulate LLMs and test their ability to generate code exploits on the Odoo platform across five mainstream LLMs.

Result: Achieved 100% success in generating working exploits with tested CVEs on five mainstream LLMs within 3-4 prompting rounds.

Conclusion: The existence of LLMs collapses the barriers between technical and non-technical actors, necessitating a complete overhaul of software engineering security practices in this new paradigm.

Abstract: LLMs democratize software engineering by enabling non-programmers to create applications, but this same accessibility fundamentally undermines security assumptions that have guided software engineering for decades. We show in this work how publicly available LLMs can be socially engineered to transform novices into capable attackers, challenging the foundational principle that exploitation requires technical expertise. To that end, we propose RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation), a pretexting strategy that manipulates LLMs into generating functional exploits despite their safety mechanisms. Testing against Odoo -- a widely used ERP platform, we evaluated five mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek) and achieved a 100% success rate: tested CVE yielded at least one working exploit within 3-4 prompting rounds. While prior work [13] found LLM-assisted attacks difficult and requiring manual effort, we demonstrate that this overhead can be eliminated entirely.
  Our findings invalidate core software engineering security principles: the distinction between technical and non-technical actors no longer provides valid threat models; technical complexity of vulnerability descriptions offers no protection when LLMs can abstract it away; and traditional security boundaries dissolve when the same tools that build software can be manipulated to break it. This represents a paradigm shift in software engineering -- we must redesign security practices for an era where exploitation requires only the ability to craft prompts, not understand code.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FasterPy, a framework combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize Python code execution efficiently using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based code optimization methods are labor-intensive and limited in scope, while machine learning approaches are costly and difficult to scale. LLMs have shown potential in code generation and offer possibilities for automated optimization.

Method: FasterPy integrates LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation using a knowledge base of performance-improving code edits and measurements, and Low-Rank Adaptation to enhance performance.

Result: The proposed FasterPy framework outperforms other models in multiple metrics on the PIE benchmark for Python code optimization.

Conclusion: FasterPy offers a low-cost, scalable, and effective solution for optimizing Python code execution using the capabilities of LLMs, facilitating better automation in code optimization.

Abstract: Code often suffers from performance bugs. These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements. However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale. With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization. In this work, we proposed FasterPy, a low-cost and efficient framework that adapts LLMs to optimize the execution efficiency of Python code. FasterPy combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), supported by a knowledge base constructed from existing performance-improving code pairs and corresponding performance measurements, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance code optimization performance. Our experimental results on the Performance Improving Code Edits (PIE) benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models on multiple metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GenAI tools are being used in software engineering, their benefits, challenges, and organizational/societal impacts.

Method: The study empirically investigates the adoption and integration of GenAI tools in SE activities, focusing on practitioner-reported experiences and perspectives.

Result: The paper finds widespread use of GenAI tools in SE, with benefits like reduced cycle time, quality improvements, and productivity gains. Challenges include unreliable outputs, validation overhead, and security/privacy concerns.

Conclusion: GenAI tools are significantly integrated into SE, bringing benefits and challenges. Practitioners foresee role redefinition rather than replacement, emphasizing a need for governance and training alongside adoption.

Abstract: Context. GenAI tools are being increasingly adopted by practitioners in SE, promising support for several SE activities. Despite increasing adoption, we still lack empirical evidence on how GenAI is used in practice, the benefits it provides, the challenges it introduces, and its broader organizational and societal implications. Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance. Practitioners expect GenAI to redefine rather than replace their roles, while expressing moderate concern about job market contraction and skill shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the complex security challenges specific to AI models and applications, which remain under-researched.

Method: An empirical study of security discussions, employing a pipeline using keyword matching and a fine-tuned distilBERT classifier to analyze 312,868 posts and derive insights.

Result: A taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across themes such as System, External Tools, Models, and Data was developed, revealing gaps in Model and Data security solutions.

Conclusion: Evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers can help tackle real-world AI security threats by addressing identified challenges and gaps.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced autoscaling framework for Kubernetes using AIOps principles to better balance Service Level Objectives (SLO) and cost under different workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address SLO violations and cost inefficiencies found in Kubernetes' current reactive and opaque autoscaling mechanisms.

Method: A new multi-signal autoscaling framework is proposed that incorporates SLO-aware, cost-conscious controls combined with lightweight demand forecasting.

Result: The proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by 31%, improves scaling response time by 24%, and lowers infrastructure costs by 18% compared to existing autoscaling methods.

Conclusion: AIOps-driven, SLO-aware autoscaling enhances the reliability, cost-efficiency, and transparency of Kubernetes-based systems.

Abstract: Kubernetes provides native autoscaling mechanisms, including the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and node-level autoscalers, to enable elastic resource management for cloud-native applications. However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.

*Henrique De Medeiros,Denisse Muñante,Sophie Chabridon,César Perdigão Batista,Denis Conan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnCoMSAS, an energy consumption monitoring tool for self-adaptive systems, enabling runtime energy analysis, evaluated through experiments on Adaptable TeaStore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing energy consumption in data centers due to cloud applications highlights the need for runtime energy reduction mechanisms, specifically targeting self-adaptive systems.

Method: Developed EnCoMSAS to monitor energy consumption in self-adaptive systems. Empirical experiments were conducted using Adaptable TeaStore with varying user workload scenarios on the Grid5000 testbed.

Result: EnCoMSAS effectively monitors software energy consumption, confirming its correlation with CPU usage. Environmental deployment factors also impact energy use, and EnCoMSAS introduces minimal additional energy consumption.

Conclusion: EnCoMSAS enables energy-awareness and efficiency for runtime self-adaptive systems while imposing modest energy overhead, helping bridge the energy-monitoring gap in SAS.

Abstract: [Context and Motivation] Global energy consumption has been steadily increasing in recent years, with data centers emerging as major contributors. This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.
  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.
  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.
  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices.

*Brice Arléon Zemtsop Ndadji,Simon Bliudze,Clément Quinton*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AdaptiFlow is a framework for cloud architectures that enhances microservice adaptability using autonomous computing principles, focusing on metric collection, execution, and decentralized adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of centralized adaptation models in microservices, enabling resilience and adaptability in modern cloud-native systems.

Method: AdaptiFlow creates abstraction layers for Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop, introducing tools like Metrics Collectors, Adaptation Actions, and an Event-Driven rule-based mechanism.

Result: Implemented in the Adaptable TeaStore benchmark, AdaptiFlow demonstrates effective self-healing, self-protection, and self-optimization capabilities with minimal code changes.

Conclusion: AdaptiFlow bridges autonomic computing with cloud-native environments, allowing for decentralized decision-making and system adaptation with future potential in AI agent integration for proactive solutions.

Abstract: Modern cloud architectures demand self-adaptive capabilities to manage dynamic operational conditions. Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service.

*Xinyi Zheng,Ningke Li,Xiaokun Luan,Kailong Wang,Ling Shi,Meng Sun,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes MATP, a framework to verify logical reasoning in LLMs by translating reasoning into First-Order Logic and using automated theorem provers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in critical fields, but their subtle logical errors in reasoning pose significant risks.

Method: MATP uses First-Order Logic translation and automated theorem proving to evaluate logical validity and detect reasoning flaws.

Result: MATP significantly outperforms existing methods in logic verification by 42 percentage points and highlights differences in reasoning coherence between models.

Conclusion: MATP enhances trust in LLM reasoning by systematically identifying and addressing logical errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, leading to their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific research. However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning.
  To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models. These results demonstrate MATP's potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated reasoning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Model-Based Development (MBD) framework to enable effective parallelization for Robot Operating System (ROS) 2-compatible Simulink models in autonomous systems, addressing challenges in manual parallelization and integration with modern frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and scale of embedded systems, particularly in autonomous driving, demand effective parallelization. Traditional approaches face issues like concurrency problems, and model-based development struggles with multi-input settings in modern frameworks like ROS 2.

Method: The authors present an MBD framework that categorizes ROS 2-compatible models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. This framework also supports automated parallelized code generation for models with multiple inputs.

Result: The proposed approach successfully reduces the execution time for all tested patterns following parallelization, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively extends traditional parallelization methods, automates the process for ROS 2-based systems, and proves to be beneficial for modern embedded systems requiring high performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the complexity and scale of embedded systems, especially in the rapidly developing field of autonomous driving systems, have increased significantly. This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs. The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated cortical parcellation, improving brain region mapping for research and clinical use.

Method: Developed JParc framework combining accurate cortical registration and learned atlas propagation with fine-tuning via shallow subnetworks.

Result: JParc delivers superior accuracy, with a Dice score exceeding 90% using sulcal depth and curvature features.

Conclusion: JParc enhances statistical power in neuroscience and supports clinical applications, outperforming traditional parcellation methods.

Abstract: Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.

TL;DR: DFINE is a deep learning framework tailored for analyzing human intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, effectively capturing nonlinear dynamics, handling missing data, and outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of linear dynamical models and recurrent neural networks in capturing nonlinear neural dynamics and handling missing data for human iEEG recordings.

Method: Extend DFINE, which combines neural networks with linear state-space models, for multisite iEEG recordings, focusing on robust forecasting and compatibility with BCIs.

Result: DFINE surpasses LSSMs in neural forecasting accuracy, matches or exceeds GRU models, handles missing observations robustly, and shows stronger performance in high gamma spectral recording bands.

Conclusion: DFINE offers a robust, flexible framework for modeling iEEG dynamics, making it highly suitable for advanced brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.

*Wendyam Eric Lionel Ilboudo,Saori C Tanaka*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational account of decision paralysis, exploring its causes and mechanisms using hierarchical decision models and KL inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and model decision paralysis, a condition where individuals hesitate or fail to act despite knowing their motivations and options, with a particular focus on autism research.

Method: They use a computational model separating intent selection (goal selection) and affordance selection (action selection), formalized through reverse- and forward-KL inference to study decision behaviors.

Result: Findings suggest that forward-KL-biased inference can lead to slow decision-making, intent/affordance saturation under similar option values, and replication of decision inertia/shutdown in simulated tasks.

Conclusion: Decision paralysis can be explained as convergence failure in hierarchical decision models, with autism characterized as an extreme case of a general decision-making spectrum.

Abstract: Decision paralysis, i.e. hesitation, freezing, or failure to act despite full knowledge and motivation, poses a challenge for choice models that assume options are already specified and readily comparable. Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically inspired neural architecture, Rectified Spectral Units (ReSUs), which implements a self-supervised method for progressively constructing complex features, with results aligning to observed biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a neural model that aligns with biological fidelity while also providing a novel, self-supervised method for constructing deep neural networks.

Method: The proposed Rectified Spectral Units (ReSUs) use canonical correlation analysis to process input history into canonical directions. Features are developed self-supervised by encoding these directions via synaptic weights and rectifying them.

Result: The two-layer ReSU network successfully exhibited biological fidelity by mimicking Drosophila neuron behaviors and developed motion direction-selective units resembling those found biologically.

Conclusion: ReSUs serve as a robust framework for modeling biological sensory systems and offer an alternative, biologically grounded approach to constructing deep neural networks without backpropagation.

Abstract: We introduce a biologically inspired, multilayer neural architecture composed of Rectified Spectral Units (ReSUs). Each ReSU projects a recent window of its input history onto a canonical direction obtained via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of previously observed past-future input pairs, and then rectifies either its positive or negative component. By encoding canonical directions in synaptic weights and temporal filters, ReSUs implement a local, self-supervised algorithm for progressively constructing increasingly complex features.
  To evaluate both computational power and biological fidelity, we trained a two-layer ReSU network in a self-supervised regime on translating natural scenes. First-layer units, each driven by a single pixel, developed temporal filters resembling those of Drosophila post-photoreceptor neurons (L1/L2 and L3), including their empirically observed adaptation to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second-layer units, which pooled spatially over the first layer, became direction-selective -- analogous to T4 motion-detecting cells -- with learned synaptic weight patterns approximating those derived from connectomic reconstructions.
  Together, these results suggest that ReSUs offer (i) a principled framework for modeling sensory circuits and (ii) a biologically grounded, backpropagation-free paradigm for constructing deep self-supervised neural networks.

### [563] [Somatosensory prediction in premature neonates: iatrogenic pain experience increases repetition suppression and deviance detection of innocuous stimuli in a tactile oddball protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23301)
*Anne-Lise Marais,Victoria Dumont,Marie Anquetil,Arnaud Mortier,Anne-Sophie Trentesaux,Nadege Roche-Labarbe*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines how sensory prediction (SP) develops in prematurely born neonates and finds that exposure to painful procedures is associated with accelerated SP maturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how perinatal factors like premature birth and exposure to neonatal pain influence the development of sensory prediction (SP), a critical component of perception and cognitive development.

Method: EEG was used to assess SP through repetition suppression (RS) and mismatch response (MMR) in a tactile oddball-omission paradigm. The study explored impacts of gestational age (GA) at birth and exposure to painful neonatal procedures on SP indices.

Result: Premature neonates exhibited RS and MMR in the contralateral somatosensory cortex. SP-related neural responses were significantly influenced by the number of painful procedures, independent of GA at birth, with higher exposure to pain correlating with more robust SP proxies.

Conclusion: Instead of impairing neurodevelopment, exposure to neonatal pain may accelerate the maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Further follow-up at age 2 will ascertain the developmental implications of these findings.

Abstract: Sensory prediction (SP) is a fundamental mechanism of perception that supports cognitive development. Atypical SP has been reported across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), suggesting it may constitute an early cross-syndromic marker. Premature birth is a major risk factor for ND, with risk increasing as gestational age (GA) at birth decreases. However, how perinatal risk factors shape the development of SP remains poorly understood. We do not know if untimely birth itself, or exposure to iatrogenic pain during neonatal intensive care, cause neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we first assessed whether SP can be detected in the brains of premature neonates at 35 weeks corrected GA using a tactile oddballomission paradigm with EEG. We then examined the effects of the degree of prematurity and of the exposure to painful care procedures on neural indices of SP. Results demonstrate the presence of repetition suppression (RS) and a mismatch response (MMR) to deviant stimuli in the contralateral somatosensory cortex of premature neonates. The amplitude of these SP proxies was significantly affected by the number of painful procedures experienced since birth, independently of the effect of GA at birth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that greater neurodevelopmental risk would be associated with less mature SP, infants with higher exposure to pain exhibited more robust indices of SP. These findings suggest that increased ex utero experience, even painful, is associated with accelerated maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Longitudinal follow-up of participants at age 2 will explore how these early markers relate to developmental outcomes.

### [564] [Dynamical incompatibilities in paced finger tapping experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23661)
*Ariel D. Silva,Claudia R. González,Rodrigo Laje*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates sensorimotor synchronization and resolves contradictions by demonstrating temporal context's role in recalibrating error-correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exist contradictions in sensorimotor synchronization studies regarding responses to two perturbation types (step changes vs. phase shifts). The paper aims to clarify these inconsistencies.

Method: The authors use experimental and theoretical approaches to examine response compatibility between perturbation types under separate and mixed experimental contexts.

Result: When perturbation types are presented together in one experiment, responses are compatible and explainable by a single dynamical system. Separate experiments show incompatibility between types due to temporal context calibration.

Conclusion: A single dynamical system represents responses to all perturbation types, but recalibration through temporal context is essential for consistency. This approach improves comparisons and expands usable data in resynchronization phases.

Abstract: The behavioral description of the sensorimotor synchronization phenomenon in humans is exhaustive, mostly by using variations of the traditional paced finger-tapping task. This task helps unveil the inner workings of the error-correction mechanism responsible for the resynchronization after a perturbation to the period of the stimuli sequence. Yet, fundamental contradictions still exist among different works in the literature. One of such contradictions only emerges after comparing the two most-common period perturbation types: step changes and phase shifts. The stimulus sequence is exactly the same in both perturbation types up to and including the (unexpected) perturbed stimulus. Why then would the timing of the next response be different between perturbation types, as observed? The explanation lies in the buildup of different temporal contexts during the experiments that recalibrate the error-correction mechanism. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that responses to different perturbation types are dynamically incompatible when they occur in separate experiments. That is, they can't be represented by the same underlying dynamical system, thus explaining many contradictory results and the difficulty in reproducing both types of perturbations with a single mathematical model. On the other hand, if both perturbation types are presented at random during the same experiment then the responses are compatible with each other and can be construed as produced by a unique underlying mechanism. We conclude that a single underlying dynamical system can represent the response to all perturbation types, signs, and sizes, which is nevertheless recalibrated by temporal context. Our results offer a ground for performing better comparisons in paced finger tapping and extend the usable range of data beyond the perturbed stimulus and into the information-rich resynchronization phase.

TL;DR: The paper identifies the equivalencies among five popular nonnegative matrix factorization models and focuses on their uniqueness in solutions, backed by proofs and illustrations using a social science dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the lack of understanding about the equivalence and similarities among widely used nonnegative matrix factorization models across various disciplines.

Method: The authors compare five models—LBA, LCA, EMA, PLSA, and NMF—to establish their equivalence using theoretical proofs. They also review relevant algorithms for these models and illustrate the concepts with a dataset from social science.

Result: The paper proves that the uniqueness of solutions among the models (LBA, EMA, LCA, PLSA) depends on the uniqueness in NMF. It also reveals their equivalence, providing clarity across fields.

Conclusion: Highlighting and proving the shared mathematical foundation among these models advances consistency and supports better communication and interpretation across interdisciplinary studies.

Abstract: Across fields such as machine learning, social science, geography, considerable attention has been given to models that factorize a nonnegative matrix into the product of two or three matrices, subject to nonnegative or row-sum-to-1 constraints. Although these models are to a large extend similar or even equivalent, they are presented under different names, and their similarity is not well known. This paper highlights similarities among five popular models, latent budget analysis (LBA), latent class analysis (LCA), end-member analysis (EMA), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We focus on an essential issue-identifiability-of these models and prove that the solution of LBA, EMA, LCA, PLSA is unique if and only if the solution of NMF is unique. We also provide a brief review for algorithms of these models. We illustrate the models with a time budget dataset from social science, and end the paper with a discussion of closely related models such as archetypal analysis.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fibonacci Ensembles, inspired by the Fibonacci sequence, as a novel framework for ensemble learning, extending classical techniques like boosting and bagging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore intrinsic natural harmonies, represented by the Fibonacci sequence, and apply them to develop improved ensemble learning methods.

Method: They propose two formulations: normalized Fibonacci weights for variance reduction and second-order recursive ensemble dynamics, inspired by the Fibonacci flow.

Result: Through regression experiments with random Fourier and polynomial ensembles, they demonstrate that Fibonacci Ensembles match or improve uniform averaging and optimize with Rao-Blackwellization.

Conclusion: Fibonacci Ensembles provide a mathematically rigorous and interpretable framework for ensemble learning, with potential to enhance its theoretical underpinnings.

Abstract: Nature rarely reveals her secrets bluntly, yet in the Fibonacci sequence she grants us a glimpse of her quiet architecture of growth, harmony, and recursive stability \citep{Koshy2001Fibonacci, Livio2002GoldenRatio}. From spiral galaxies to the unfolding of leaves, this humble sequence reflects a universal grammar of balance. In this work, we introduce \emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization. These findings suggest that Fibonacci ensembles form a natural and interpretable design point within the broader theory of ensemble learning.

*Ernest Fokoué*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a general theory for structured weighting in ensemble learning, showing how it can outperform uniform weights even for stable estimators, and provides a unified framework for bias-variance approximation and weighting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why ensemble learning methods remain effective for stable predictors (e.g., RKHS methods) where variance is already controlled and to establish a theory beyond traditional variance-reduction reasoning.

Method: The authors formalize ensembles as linear operators in a hypothesis space, impose geometric and spectral constraints on weighting sequences, and derive a refined bias-variance decomposition. They identify optimal weights using constrained quadratic programming.

Result: Structured weighting strategies provably outperform uniform weighting by reshaping approximation geometry and spectral complexity. Classical and novel ensemble methods are shown to fit within this unified framework.

Conclusion: Structured, non-uniform weighting expands the utility of ensemble learning for stable estimators, laying a theoretical foundation for adaptive and dynamic weighting approaches in future research.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is traditionally justified as a variance-reduction strategy, explaining its strong performance for unstable predictors such as decision trees. This explanation, however, does not account for ensembles constructed from intrinsically stable estimators-including smoothing splines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, and other regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods whose variance is already tightly controlled by regularization and spectral shrinkage. This paper develops a general weighting theory for ensemble learning that moves beyond classical variance-reduction arguments. We formalize ensembles as linear operators acting on a hypothesis space and endow the space of weighting sequences with geometric and spectral constraints. Within this framework, we derive a refined bias-variance approximation decomposition showing how non-uniform, structured weights can outperform uniform averaging by reshaping approximation geometry and redistributing spectral complexity, even when variance reduction is negligible. Our main results provide conditions under which structured weighting provably dominates uniform ensembles, and show that optimal weights arise as solutions to constrained quadratic programs. Classical averaging, stacking, and recently proposed Fibonacci-based ensembles appear as special cases of this unified theory, which further accommodates geometric, sub-exponential, and heavy-tailed weighting laws. Overall, the work establishes a principled foundation for structure-driven ensemble learning, explaining why ensembles remain effective for smooth, low-variance base learners and setting the stage for distribution-adaptive and dynamically evolving weighting schemes developed in subsequent work.

*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformer training via cross-entropy shapes attention and values, presenting a model that aligns optimization dynamics with probabilistic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to demystify how gradient-based learning enables transformers to perform Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, addressing the opaque mechanisms behind internal geometry formation.

Method: The paper derives equations for attention score adjustments and value updates, applying controlled simulations such as a sticky Markov-chain task to understand gradient dynamics.

Result: The findings indicate a positive feedback loop in attention and value specialization, paralleling an EM-like procedure, that aligns optimization dynamics with Bayesian inference on low-dimensional manifolds.

Conclusion: Gradient-based optimization naturally sculpts transformer geometry to facilitate probabilistic reasoning, connecting optimization processes, internal geometry, and functional outcomes.

Abstract: Transformers empirically perform precise probabilistic reasoning in carefully constructed ``Bayesian wind tunnels'' and in large-scale language models, yet the mechanisms by which gradient-based learning creates the required internal geometry remain opaque. We provide a complete first-order analysis of how cross-entropy training reshapes attention scores and value vectors in a transformer attention head. Our core result is an \emph{advantage-based routing law} for attention scores, \[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial s_{ij}} = α_{ij}\bigl(b_{ij}-\mathbb{E}_{α_i}[b]\bigr), \qquad b_{ij} := u_i^\top v_j, \] coupled with a \emph{responsibility-weighted update} for values, \[ Δv_j = -η\sum_i α_{ij} u_i, \] where $u_i$ is the upstream gradient at position $i$ and $α_{ij}$ are attention weights. These equations induce a positive feedback loop in which routing and content specialize together: queries route more strongly to values that are above-average for their error signal, and those values are pulled toward the queries that use them. We show that this coupled specialization behaves like a two-timescale EM procedure: attention weights implement an E-step (soft responsibilities), while values implement an M-step (responsibility-weighted prototype updates), with queries and keys adjusting the hypothesis frame. Through controlled simulations, including a sticky Markov-chain task where we compare a closed-form EM-style update to standard SGD, we demonstrate that the same gradient dynamics that minimize cross-entropy also sculpt the low-dimensional manifolds identified in our companion work as implementing Bayesian inference. This yields a unified picture in which optimization (gradient flow) gives rise to geometry (Bayesian manifolds), which in turn supports function (in-context probabilistic reasoning).

TL;DR: The paper introduces likelihood-preserving embeddings for ML workflows, enabling statistical inference using compressed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of statistical inference in high-dimensional settings where embeddings typically lose geometric structure needed for inference.

Method: Defines Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric, proves theoretical guarantees via Hinge theorem, uses neural networks for embeddings.

Result: Shows neural networks can approximate embeddings with controlled likelihood distortion; experiments validate with Gaussian/Cauchy data and clinical applications.

Conclusion: Likelihood-preserving embeddings allow integration of ML representations in likelihood-based inference workflows without sacrificing accuracy or validity.

Abstract: Modern machine learning embeddings provide powerful compression of high-dimensional data, yet they typically destroy the geometric structure required for classical likelihood-based statistical inference. This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.

The networks minimize a generic loss that aggregates incremental reductions in posterior error along experimental sequences. Inference networks are instantiated with diffusion-based posterior estimators that can approximate high-dimensional and multimodal posteriors at every experimental step. Across standard adaptive design benchmarks, JADAI achieves superior or competitive performance.

### [571] [Federated Learning With L0 Constraint Via Probabilistic Gates For Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23071)
*Krishna Harsha Kovelakuntla Huthasana,Alireza Olama,Andreas Lundell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Federated Learning (FL) method with L0 constraints for sparsity, resulting in communication-efficient and statistically effective models despite data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL models struggle with sparsity in data and models, leading to over-dense models and poor generalizability, especially under heterogeneous data and client conditions.

Method: Combines L0 constraint (via probabilistic gate reparameterization) with federated stochastic gradient descent to achieve controlled sparsity. Tested on various models and datasets.

Result: Achieves high target parameter sparsity (down to rho = 0.005) while maintaining statistical performance across datasets like MNIST, RCV1, and EMNIST.

Conclusion: This approach ensures communication-efficient and statistically robust federated learning models, outperforming traditional sparsity methods under diverse conditions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning setting that requires multiple clients to collaborate on training a model while maintaining data privacy. The unaddressed inherent sparsity in data and models often results in overly dense models and poor generalizability under data and client participation heterogeneity. We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC). We compare the results with a magnitude pruning-based thresholding algorithm for sparsity in FL. Experiments on synthetic data with target density down to rho = 0.05 and publicly available RCV1, MNIST, and EMNIST datasets with target density down to rho = 0.005 demonstrate that our approach is communication-efficient and consistently better in statistical performance.

### [572] [Probabilistic Modelling is Sufficient for Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23408)
*Bruno Mlodozeniec,David Krueger,Richard E. Turner*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper argues that causal inference can be performed using standard probabilistic modeling and inference without the need for specific causal tools or notations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion in the machine learning field regarding whether specialized causal frameworks or notations are necessary to address causal inference questions effectively.

Method: The paper provides concrete examples and reinterprets causal tools within the context of probabilistic modeling and inference to demonstrate its claims.

Result: The authors show that probabilistic modeling and inference are sufficient for answering causal questions, challenging the need for bespoke causal frameworks or notations.

Conclusion: Causal inference can be addressed within standard probabilistic modeling methods, and existing causal tools can be understood as emerging from standard probabilistic inference, emphasizing their utility.

Abstract: Causal inference is a key research area in machine learning, yet confusion reigns over the tools needed to tackle it. There are prevalent claims in the machine learning literature that you need a bespoke causal framework or notation to answer causal questions. In this paper, we want to make it clear that you \emph{can} answer any causal inference question within the realm of probabilistic modelling and inference, without causal-specific tools or notation. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how causal questions can be tackled by writing down the probability of everything. Lastly, we reinterpret causal tools as emerging from standard probabilistic modelling and inference, elucidating their necessity and utility.

### [573] [The Nonstationarity-Complexity Tradeoff in Return Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23596)
*Agostino Capponi,Chengpiao Huang,J. Antonio Sidaoui,Kaizheng Wang,Jiacheng Zou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for predicting stock returns in non-stationary environments, significantly improving performance over standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of balancing model complexity and non-stationarity in stock return prediction, where complex models often require longer training windows that exacerbate non-stationarity.

Method: A model selection method is proposed, using a tournament procedure to optimize both model class and training window size, evaluated on non-stationary validation data.

Result: The method outperforms standard rolling-window benchmarks by improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average and achieves robust performance during economic recessions, including the Gulf War and 2008 Financial Crisis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances key trade-offs in non-stationary environments, offering both theoretical insights and practical economic benefits in stock return prediction.

Abstract: We investigate machine learning models for stock return prediction in non-stationary environments, revealing a fundamental nonstationarity-complexity tradeoff: complex models reduce misspecification error but require longer training windows that introduce stronger non-stationarity. We resolve this tension with a novel model selection method that jointly optimizes model class and training window size using a tournament procedure that adaptively evaluates candidates on non-stationary validation data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight. Applying our method to 17 industry portfolio returns, we consistently outperform standard rolling-window benchmarks, improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average. During NBER-designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis. Economically, a trading strategy based on our selected model generates 31% higher cumulative returns averaged across the industries.

### [574] [Calibrated Multi-Level Quantile Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23671)
*Tiffany Ding,Isaac Gibbs,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) is an online method ensuring calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple levels while maintaining order among them, even in adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of calibration in quantile forecasting at multiple levels, particularly under adversarial distribution shifts.

Method: The authors introduce MultiQT, a lightweight method that wraps around existing forecasters to correct forecasts, ensuring calibration and ordered quantile levels. It also guarantees no regret in performance degradation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant calibration improvement in epidemic and energy forecasting problems using MultiQT.

Conclusion: MultiQT effectively ensures calibrated and ordered quantile forecasts with robust performance under challenging conditions, enhancing real-world applications.

Abstract: We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a post-hoc calibration procedure, Iterated Bellman Calibration, enabling calibrated value predictions for infinite-horizon MDPs under weak assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the calibration of off-policy value predictions in MDPs without relying on strong assumptions like Bellman completeness or realizability.

Method: The authors adapt histogram and isotonic calibration for dynamic, counterfactual settings by iteratively regressing Bellman targets onto model predictions using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome.

Result: Finite-sample guarantees are provided for both calibration and prediction outcomes under weak assumptions.

Conclusion: The method achieves calibrated and robust value predictions using post-hoc techniques applicable to any value estimator in MDPs.

Abstract: We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.

*Isaac Meza,Rahul Singh*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spectral regularization-based method for instrumental variable regression, providing error bounds and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in estimating linear models from noisy covariates and instruments in data-rich scenarios.

Method: Two-stage least squares (2SLS) with spectral regularization to learn canonical correlations between covariates and instruments.

Result: The paper proves upper and lower bounds on the method's estimation error and its optimality under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is theoretically sound and offers practical guidelines for applying spectral regularization in different data regimes.

Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression in data rich environments. The goal is to estimate a linear model from many noisy covariates and many noisy instruments. Our key assumption is that true covariates and true instruments are repetitive, though possibly different in nature; they each reflect a few underlying factors, however those underlying factors may be misaligned. We analyze a family of estimators based on two stage least squares with spectral regularization: canonical correlations between covariates and instruments are learned in the first stage, which are used as regressors in the second stage. As a theoretical contribution, we derive upper and lower bounds on estimation error, proving optimality of the method with noisy data. As a practical contribution, we provide guidance on which types of spectral regularization to use in different regimes.

### [577] [Causal-Policy Forest for End-to-End Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22846)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end algorithm, the causal-policy forest, for policy learning in causal inference using modifications of the causal forest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the process of policy learning by leveraging and adapting existing CATE estimation methods, particularly in a computationally efficient and end-to-end manner.

Method: The authors reformulate policy learning as minimizing MSE for CATE under restricted regression models and propose a modified version of the causal forest called the causal-policy forest.

Result: The proposed causal-policy forest offers three key benefits: easier integration with existing CATE methods, a more end-to-end training approach, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The causal-policy forest bridges the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation, offering a practical and efficient solution for causal inference tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes an end-to-end algorithm for policy learning in causal inference. We observe data consisting of covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes, where only the outcome corresponding to the assigned treatment is observed. The goal of policy learning is to train a policy from the observed data, where a policy is a function that recommends an optimal treatment for each individual, to maximize the policy value. In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\{-1, 1\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability.

### [578] [Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values II: How to Fix It with LatentNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23138)
*Yuan-Sen Ting*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses attenuation bias in neural networks, a systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to input measurement errors, by introducing the LatentNN method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attenuation bias, while addressed in linear regression, remains problematic in neural networks, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes typical of astronomical data.

Method: The authors propose LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing their joint likelihood, thus correcting attenuation bias.

Result: LatentNN effectively reduces attenuation bias in scenarios with various signal-to-noise ratios, including one-dimensional regression, correlated features, and astronomical applications.

Conclusion: LatentNN enables improved inference for neural networks, particularly when measurement errors are moderate, enhancing their application in domains like astronomy.

Abstract: Attenuation bias -- the systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to measurement errors in input variables -- affects astronomical data-driven models. For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

Conclusion: Space AI has the potential to improve space exploration and operations, while advancing AI technologies with significant benefits for societal applications on Earth.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry. As progress on Earth meets growing constraints, the next frontier is outer space, where AI can enable autonomous, resilient operations under extreme uncertainty and limited human oversight. This paper introduces Space AI as a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: 1 AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; 2 AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; (3) AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human-AI collaboration under communication constraints; and 4 AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks. Ultimately, Space AI can accelerate humanity's capability to explore and operate in space, while translating advances in sensing, robotics, optimisation, and trustworthy AI into broad societal impact on Earth.

*David Lindner,Charlie Griffin,Tomek Korbak,Roland S. Zimmermann,Geoffrey Irving,Sebastian Farquhar,Alan Cooney*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates strategies for designing automated control monitors to oversee AI systems, focusing on challenges such as oversight latency, identifying harmful agents, and recovery mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of securely monitoring advanced AI agents in real-world deployments, where issues such as delayed oversight and agents acting incrementally may arise.

Method: The authors analyze three monitoring protocols (synchronous, semi-synchronous, and asynchronous) and introduce a high-level safety case sketch as a tool for evaluation. They also conduct four case studies on potential future AI deployments.

Result: Three main challenges (oversight, latency, and recovery) are identified while comparing the monitoring protocols.

Conclusion: Effective monitoring solutions must balance latency-safety trade-offs to improve oversight and recovery in AI control systems, providing valuable insight into future deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Automated control monitors could play an important role in overseeing highly capable AI agents that we do not fully trust. Prior work has explored control monitoring in simplified settings, but scaling monitoring to real-world deployments introduces additional dynamics: parallel agent instances, non-negligible oversight latency, incremental attacks between agent instances, and the difficulty of identifying scheming agents based on individual harmful actions. In this paper, we analyse design choices to address these challenges, focusing on three forms of monitoring with different latency-safety trade-offs: synchronous, semi-synchronous, and asynchronous monitoring. We introduce a high-level safety case sketch as a tool for understanding and comparing these monitoring protocols. Our analysis identifies three challenges -- oversight, latency, and recovery -- and explores them in four case studies of possible future AI deployments.

### [581] [Beyond Single Bugs: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multi-Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22306)
*Chinmay Pushkar,Sanchit Kabra,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for multi-vulnerability detection in software, finding that LLMs struggle as vulnerability density increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately assess LLMs' capabilities on complex, real-world software security tasks with multiple interacting vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors constructed a 40,000-file dataset by injecting varying counts of vulnerabilities into long-context code samples across C, C++, Python, and JavaScript, and evaluated five state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Performance significantly deteriorates with higher vulnerability density, with distinct failure modes observed for Python and JavaScript compared to C/C++.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement to handle complex, multi-vulnerability scenarios effectively, particularly for certain programming languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in automated software security, particularly in vulnerability detection. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on isolated, single-vulnerability samples or function-level classification, failing to reflect the complexity of real-world software where multiple interacting vulnerabilities often coexist within large files. Recent studies indicate that LLMs suffer from "count bias" and "selection bias" in multi-label tasks, yet this has not been rigorously quantified in the domain of code security. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Vulnerability Detection across four major languages: C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We construct a dataset of 40,000 files by systematically injecting controlled counts of vulnerabilities (1, 3, 5, and 9) into long-context code samples (7.5k-10k tokens) sourced from CodeParrot. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.3-70B, and the Qwen-2.5 series. Our results reveal a sharp degradation in performance as vulnerability density increases. While Llama-3.3-70B achieves near-perfect F1 scores (approximately 0.97) on single-vulnerability C tasks, performance drops by up to 40% in high-density settings. Notably, Python and JavaScript show distinct failure modes compared to C/C++, with models exhibiting severe "under-counting" (Recall dropping to less than 0.30) in complex Python files.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an IP protection scheme called LLA for generative AI models, combining hardware and software measures against theft and other threats, with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect intellectual property of generative AI models from threats such as theft, corruption, and information leakage, especially in a vulnerable supply chain environment.

Method: The method involves embedding key bits in neurons to trigger performance degradation and applying transformations for obscurity, combined with a hardware module for unlocking access to model services using a secret key.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that LLA resists key optimization attacks while maintaining a very low computational overhead of less than 0.1% for 7,168 key bits.

Conclusion: LLA effectively protects generative AI IP with negligible performance cost, offering a secure and practical solution against supply chain threats.

Abstract: We introduce LLA, an effective intellectual property (IP) protection scheme for generative AI models. LLA leverages the synergy between hardware and software to defend against various supply chain threats, including model theft, model corruption, and information leakage. On the software side, it embeds key bits into neurons that can trigger outliers to degrade performance and applies invariance transformations to obscure the key values. On the hardware side, it integrates a lightweight locking module into the AI accelerator while maintaining compatibility with various dataflow patterns and toolchains. An accelerator with a pre-stored secret key acts as a license to access the model services provided by the IP owner. The evaluation results show that LLA can withstand a broad range of oracle-guided key optimization attacks, while incurring a minimal computational overhead of less than 0.1% for 7,168 key bits.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the transformative impact of AI, particularly foundation models like large language models, on cybersecurity, advocating for a shift toward agentic cyber resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of traditional, prevention-focused cybersecurity systems in the face of advanced AI capabilities, emphasizing the need for adaptive and resilient security systems.

Method: Proposes a system-level framework for agentic AI workflows, introducing a general agentic architecture and using game-theoretic models to analyze adaptive attacker and defender dynamics.

Result: Provides a framework for designing AI-driven cybersecurity systems and illustrates its application in automated penetration testing, remediation, and cyber deception through equilibrium-based designs.

Conclusion: AI-augmented cybersecurity systems, based on agentic workflows and resilient designs, are essential to address modern security challenges, making them more adaptive and autonomous.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is being fundamentally reshaped by foundation-model-based artificial intelligence. Large language models now enable autonomous planning, tool orchestration, and strategic adaptation at scale, challenging security architectures built on static rules, perimeter defenses, and human-centered workflows. This chapter argues for a shift from prevention-centric security toward agentic cyber resilience. Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition. Case studies in automated penetration testing, remediation, and cyber deception illustrate how equilibrium-based design enables system-level resiliency design.

### [584] [DECEPTICON: How Dark Patterns Manipulate Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22894)
*Phil Cuvin,Hao Zhu,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reveals how dark patterns (manipulative UI designs) highly influence the behavior of web agents, making them less robust, as shown in the newly introduced DECEPTICON framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the impact of dark patterns on web agents which can significantly manipulate agent behavior, posing risks to robustness that have not been adequately quantified before.

Method: The researchers developed DECEPTICON, an environment containing 700 tasks involving dark patterns (600 generated, 100 real-world), to test and measure how agents react to manipulative UI designs.

Result: Dark patterns are found to successfully manipulate state-of-the-art agents in over 70% of tasks, significantly more than humans (31%). Larger, more advanced models are even more vulnerable to these manipulations. Existing defenses were largely ineffective.

Conclusion: Dark patterns are a severe and unaddressed risk for web agents, necessitating urgent development of more robust defenses to combat these manipulative techniques.

Abstract: Deceptive UI designs, widely instantiated across the web and commonly known as dark patterns, manipulate users into performing actions misaligned with their goals. In this paper, we show that dark patterns are highly effective in steering agent trajectories, posing a significant risk to agent robustness. To quantify this risk, we introduce DECEPTICON, an environment for testing individual dark patterns in isolation. DECEPTICON includes 700 web navigation tasks with dark patterns -- 600 generated tasks and 100 real-world tasks, designed to measure instruction-following success and dark pattern effectiveness. Across state-of-the-art agents, we find dark patterns successfully steer agent trajectories towards malicious outcomes in over 70% of tested generated and real-world tasks -- compared to a human average of 31%. Moreover, we find that dark pattern effectiveness correlates positively with model size and test-time reasoning, making larger, more capable models more susceptible. Leading countermeasures against adversarial attacks, including in-context prompting and guardrail models, fail to consistently reduce the success rate of dark pattern interventions. Our findings reveal dark patterns as a latent and unmitigated risk to web agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against manipulative designs.

*Zhen Liang,Hai Huang,Zhengkui Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Equacode, a robust multi-strategy jailbreak technique targeting large language models by using equation-solving and code completion to bypass safety measures, yielding high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trustworthiness issues in large language models, particularly their susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in eliciting harmful or unsafe responses.

Method: Equacode employs a unique approach involving mathematical problem transformation and code generation by LLMs to prioritize task solving over safety constraints, exploiting complexity from cross-domain task integration.

Result: Experiments show Equacode achieves a high success rate: 91.19% on GPT series models and 98.65% across other state-of-the-art LLMs, using a single query.

Conclusion: The synergistic, multi-strategy approach of Equacode significantly enhances jailbreak effectiveness, suggesting that combining task complexities results in more effective attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of fields. However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts.

*Soham Padia,Dhananjay Vaidya,Ramchandra Mangrulkar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a trust-based delegated consensus mechanism combining Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Attribute-Based Access Control with reinforcement learning to defend blockchain-enabled IoT networks against advanced attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of securing blockchain IoT networks against adversarial attacks while maintaining privacy-preserving and reliable policy evaluations.

Method: The paper uses a combination of Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Attribute-Based Access Control, and reinforcement learning approaches (Q-learning, Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN, and Multi-Agent RL) to evaluate their effectiveness against five attack types across a 16-node simulated IoT network.

Result: Multi-Agent RL outperformed others in detecting collusive attacks (F1=0.85), while both DRL and MARL achieved perfect detection against adaptive and Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). However, all approaches failed against Time-Delayed Poisoning attacks, showcasing a significant vulnerability.

Conclusion: Coordinated multi-agent learning is effective for sophisticated trust manipulation defenses in blockchain IoT environments, but more work is needed to address severe threats like Time-Delayed Poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Securing blockchain-enabled IoT networks against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries. Our findings indicate that coordinated multi-agent learning provides measurable advantages for defending against sophisticated trust manipulation attacks in blockchain IoT environments.

*Armstrong Foundjem,Lionel Nganyewou Tidjon,Leuson Da Silva,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines security risks in machine learning (ML), focusing on vulnerabilities in foundation models and proposing ML-specific threat frameworks to address lifecycle risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the critical reliance on ML models in domains like finance and healthcare, which makes them targets for advanced cybersecurity threats not addressed by traditional frameworks.

Method: The authors identified 93 threats by analyzing datasets like MITRE ATLAS, the AI Incident Database, and literature, along with studying Python/GitHub repositories. They used a multi-agent RAG system to build a threat graph connecting vulnerabilities and lifecycle stages.

Result: They found previously unreported threats, such as model stealing from commercial LLM APIs and advanced jailbreaking methods. Analysis identified dense vulnerability clusters in poorly maintained libraries.

Conclusion: Adaptive security frameworks, integrating dependency hygiene, threat intelligence, and monitoring, are crucial to mitigate risks across the ML lifecycle, especially in pre-training and inference stages.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) underpins foundation models in finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, making them targets for data poisoning, model extraction, prompt injection, automated jailbreaking, and preference-guided black-box attacks that exploit model comparisons. Larger models can be more vulnerable to introspection-driven jailbreaks and cross-modal manipulation. Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference. Graph analysis reveals dense vulnerability clusters in libraries with poor patch propagation. Conclusion: Adaptive, ML-specific security frameworks, combining dependency hygiene, threat intelligence, and monitoring, are essential to mitigate supply-chain and inference risks across the ML lifecycle.

### [588] [Agentic AI for Autonomous Defense in Software Supply Chain Security: Beyond Provenance to Vulnerability Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23480)
*Toqeer Ali Syed,Mohammad Riyaz Belgaum,Salman Jan,Asadullah Abdullah Khan,Saad Said Alqahtani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-driven framework for strengthening software supply chain security through proactive detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities, using large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of securing software supply chains, such as post-build integrity checks, are becoming ineffective as attacks now target trusted development and delivery processes. Existing frameworks focus on provenance and traceability but lack active vulnerability detection and mitigation.

Method: The paper introduces a novel agentic AI framework that integrates LLM-based reasoning, RL for adaptive defenses, and multi-agent coordination. It uses tools like LangChain and LangGraph, interfaces with CI/CD environments via Model Context Protocol (MCP), and ensures security auditing using blockchain technology.

Result: The framework was tested on simulated pipelines and real-world CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions and Jenkins. It handled various attack types, achieving superior detection accuracy, faster mitigation, and reasonable build overhead compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of agentic AI in transforming software supply chains from reactive to proactive systems, enhancing their resilience against modern threats.

Abstract: The software supply chain attacks are becoming more and more focused on trusted development and delivery procedures, so the conventional post-build integrity mechanisms cannot be used anymore. The available frameworks like SLSA, SBOM and in toto are majorly used to offer provenance and traceability but do not have the capabilities of actively identifying and removing vulnerabilities in software production. The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines. These results show that agentic AI can facilitate the transition to self defending, proactive software supply chains rather than reactive verification ones.

*Yu Jiang,Xindi Tong,Ziyao Liu,Xiaoxi Zhang,Kwok-Yan Lam,Chee Wei Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedORA, a method for Federated Unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), addressing challenges in data removal with reduced computational and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and implement the 'right to be forgotten' by enabling effective unlearning in the complex feature-distributed architecture of VFL models.

Method: FedORA uses primal-dual optimization with a unique unlearning loss function promoting classification uncertainty, adaptive step sizes for stability, and asymmetric batch design for computational efficiency.

Result: FedORA achieves effective unlearning and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch, with significantly reduced computation and communication overhead.

Conclusion: FedORA provides a robust solution for privacy-focused unlearning in VFL, effectively balancing unlearning performance and computational costs while maintaining utility.

Abstract: Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the "right to be forgotten." While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.

### [590] [Toward Trustworthy Agentic AI: A Multimodal Framework for Preventing Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23557)
*Toqeer Ali Syed,Mishal Ateeq Almutairi,Mahmoud Abdel Moaty*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a defense framework to address multimodal prompt injection attacks in agentic AI systems, using sanitization, validation, and provenance tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the risks posed by multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks in agentic AI systems, which can spread malicious instructions and cause unintended system behavior.

Method: A defense framework is proposed, incorporating text and visual sanitizers, an output validator agent, and a provenance ledger to sanitize inputs and verify outputs across agent networks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved detection accuracy of multimodal injection, reduced cross-agent trust leakage, and enhanced stability in execution pathways.

Conclusion: The framework ensures secure, comprehensible, and reliable communication in AI agent networks, mitigating the impact of multimodal prompt injections.

Abstract: Powerful autonomous systems, which reason, plan, and converse using and between numerous tools and agents, are made possible by Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and new agentic AI systems, like LangChain and GraphChain. Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable. The framework, which expands the concept of provenance tracking and validation to the multi-agent orchestration, enhances the establishment of secure, understandable and reliable agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes deep learning methods for regression and classification, introducing two estimators, NPDNN and SPDNN, and demonstrates their minimax optimal properties in various statistical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalized deep learning framework for regression and classification tasks adaptable to different data dependencies such as mixing types and optimization complexities.

Method: The paper introduces two estimators: NPDNN (non-penalized deep neural network estimator) and SPDNN (sparse-penalized deep neural network estimator), deriving their expected excess risk bounds on Hölder smooth functions.

Result: Expected excess risk bounds for the proposed methods are established, demonstrating minimax optimality in classical settings with independent and mixing data processes.

Conclusion: NPDNN and SPDNN offer robust solutions for nonparametric regression and classification, achieving optimality under diverse data scenarios.

Abstract: This paper develops a general approach for deep learning for a setting that includes nonparametric regression and classification. We perform a framework from data that fulfills a generalized Bernstein-type inequality, including independent, $φ$-mixing, strongly mixing and $\mathcal{C}$-mixing observations. Two estimators are proposed: a non-penalized deep neural network estimator (NPDNN) and a sparse-penalized deep neural network estimator (SPDNN). For each of these estimators, bounds of the expected excess risk on the class of Hölder smooth functions and composition Hölder functions are established. Applications to independent data, as well as to $φ$-mixing, strongly mixing, $\mathcal{C}$-mixing processes are considered. For each of these examples, the upper bounds of the expected excess risk of the proposed NPDNN and SPDNN predictors are derived. It is shown that both the NPDNN and SPDNN estimators are minimax optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in many classical settings.

*Saurabh Deochake,Debajyoti Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The study evaluates cloud compute costs of SQL queries generated by six state-of-the-art LLMs for efficient usage in cloud databases, revealing inefficiencies and offering deployment tips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in efficiency metrics, focusing on cost implications of LLM-generated SQL queries on cloud data warehouses rather than solely execution time.

Method: The authors systematically evaluated six LLMs by testing 180 SQL queries on Google BigQuery's 230GB StackOverflow dataset, analyzing metrics like bytes processed, slot utilization, and costs.

Result: The study finds reasoning models reduce byte processing by 44.5% while matching accuracy; speed doesn't correlate strongly with cost, and models show significant cost and processing variances.

Conclusion: Cloud compute cost inefficiencies are prevalent with LLM-generated SQL queries, and the paper suggests guidelines for optimizing deployments in cost-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, yet existing efficiency metrics such as the Valid Efficiency Score (VES) measure execution time rather than the consumption-based costs of cloud data warehouses. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of cloud compute costs for LLM-generated SQL queries. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query. We identify prevalent inefficiency patterns including missing partition filters and unnecessary full-table scans, and provide deployment guidelines for cost-sensitive enterprise environments.

*Hanze Meng,Jianhao Cao,Rachel Pottinger*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Column Type Annotation (CTA) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance performance while addressing limitations of existing methods reliant on generative or fully fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of current CTA methods including sensitivity to prompt variations, limited applicability across datasets, and computational costs of fine-tuning large models.

Method: A parameter-efficient framework using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) combined with prompt-augmented training to improve performance and robustness in CTA tasks.

Result: Models trained with LoRA show stable performance across varied prompt patterns during inference and achieve higher weighted F1 scores compared to single-template methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates prompt-sensitivity and reduces computational cost, making CTA systems more practical and adaptable across diverse data and scenarios.

Abstract: Column Type Annotation (CTA) is a fundamental step towards enabling schema alignment and semantic understanding of tabular data. Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in Text-to-SQL systems caused by a lack of high-quality training data and limited capability of models to reason in complex scenarios.

Method: The framework includes a Data-Centric iterative data factory for synthesizing high-quality data and a Model-Centric Agentic Reinforcement Learning framework, starting with Diversity-Aware Cold Start and refining policies via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Experiments using BIRD and Spider benchmarks reveal that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance among single-model solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-centric framework significantly enhances Text-to-SQL performance by improving data alignment and refining model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of Text-to-SQL systems is currently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data and the limited reasoning capabilities of models in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that addresses these issues through a dual-centric approach. From a Data-Centric perspective, we construct an iterative data factory that synthesizes RL-ready data characterized by high correctness and precise semantic-logic alignment, ensured by strict verification. From a Model-Centric perspective, we introduce a novel Agentic Reinforcement Learning framework. This framework employs a Diversity-Aware Cold Start stage to initialize a robust policy, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the agent's reasoning via environmental feedback. Extensive experiments on BIRD and Spider benchmarks demonstrate that our synergistic approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among single-model methods.

### [595] [Deep classifier kriging for probabilistic spatial prediction of air quality index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23474)
*Junyu Chen,Pratik Nag,Huixia Judy-Wang,Ying Sun*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces the deep classifier kriging (DCK) method for non-Gaussian AQI spatial predictions, effectively integrating station and auxiliary data for better predictive accuracy and uncertainty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like kriging, which rely on linearity and Gaussian assumptions, struggle to accurately predict AQI due to its nonlinearity and non-Gaussian characteristics. Better predictive methods are needed for regulatory and risk assessment tasks.

Method: The authors propose a distribution-free deep learning framework, DCK, that includes a data fusion mechanism to handle heterogeneous data sources. Simulations and real-world applications validate its predictive accuracy and uncertainty assessment capabilities.

Result: DCK demonstrated superior performance over conventional methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Application to AQI prediction showed effective fusion of sparse, high-quality data with continuous, biased auxiliary outputs.

Conclusion: DCK provides a robust tool for probabilistic AQI spatial predictions, enabling better support for regulatory risk assessment and policy-making.

Abstract: Accurate spatial interpolation of the air quality index (AQI), computed from concentrations of multiple air pollutants, is essential for regulatory decision-making, yet AQI fields are inherently non-Gaussian and often exhibit complex nonlinear spatial structure. Classical spatial prediction methods such as kriging are linear and rely on Gaussian assumptions, which limits their ability to capture these features and to provide reliable predictive distributions. In this study, we propose \textit{deep classifier kriging} (DCK), a flexible, distribution-free deep learning framework for estimating full predictive distribution functions for univariate and bivariate spatial processes, together with a \textit{data fusion} mechanism that enables modeling of non-collocated bivariate processes and integration of heterogeneous air pollution data sources. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that DCK consistently outperforms conventional approaches in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. We further apply DCK to probabilistic spatial prediction of AQI by fusing sparse but high-quality station observations with spatially continuous yet biased auxiliary model outputs, yielding spatially resolved predictive distributions that support downstream tasks such as exceedance and extreme-event probability estimation for regulatory risk assessment and policy formulation.

TL;DR: This paper applies deep learning to art market valuation, showing that integrating visual data improves predictive models, especially for first-time sales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether incorporating visual content through deep learning can enhance the accuracy of predictive models in art market valuations, especially for debut market works.

Method: The study uses a repeated-sales dataset and compares classical regression, tree-based models, and modern deep learning architectures, including multi-modal models combining tabular and image data. Interpretability is analyzed using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations.

Result: Visual embeddings improve valuation predictions for fresh-to-market artworks, where traditional input variables are limited. The models also use compositional and stylistic cues effectively.

Conclusion: Multi-modal deep learning adds value to art market valuation, particularly in challenging cases like first-time sales, offering new insights for academia and practice.

Abstract: We study how deep learning can improve valuation in the art market by incorporating the visual content of artworks into predictive models. Using a large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses, we benchmark classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data. We find that while artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide a distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations show that models attend to compositional and stylistic cues. Our findings demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest, namely first-time sales, and thus offers new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.

Result: The findings emphasize the importance of behavior coverage in autonomous vehicle testing and identify areas for optimization in simulation frameworks. The MPC pedestrian agent achieves more realistic and interesting behaviors.

Conclusion: This study advances autonomous vehicle testing by providing systematic methods for behavior evaluation, with implications for improving safety, reliability, and performance of these systems through better simulation practices.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicle technology advances, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving.
  Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments. The results offer valuable implications for enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of autonomous vehicles through rigorous testing methodologies.

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing and adapting to new teammates' behavior in ad-hoc teamwork settings, emphasizing retrieval-augmented generation for reliable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve agents' ability to understand and adapt to unseen teammate behaviors in environments with partial observability and limited interaction.

Method: The paper proposes \Collab, a language-based framework using LLMs for classifying partner behavior from trajectory features, and \ReCollab, which enhances this approach with retrieval-augmented generation for better inference.

Result: In the Overcooked environment, \Collab effectively classifies teammate types, while \ReCollab achieves consistent adaptive performance and balances classification accuracy with episodic return.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially with retrieval-augmented grounding, hold significant potential as behavioral world models for collaborative tasks in complex environments.

Abstract: Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to infer the behavior of previously unseen teammates and adapt their policy accordingly. Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.

*Stefan Edelkamp*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of planning missions for multiple agents with multiple goals in graphs, optimizing goal assignment and path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient planning methods for multi-agent systems handling both goal assignment and routing to simplify and optimize mission execution.

Method: Implemented a planner handling conflict-free optimized paths through global assignment strategies, solving local assignment conflicts, and novel techniques like interleaving paths and 'kicking' agents.

Result: Demonstrated polynomial-time solutions for discrete settings and near-optimal solutions for continuous cases, which challenges traditional NP-hard paradigms in graph routing.

Conclusion: The approach provides computationally efficient solutions for multi-agent mission planning, improving on existing methods and offering practical strategies for conflict resolution.

Abstract: In this paper, we plan missions for a fleet of agents in undirected graphs, such as grids, with multiple goals. In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations

TL;DR: The paper presents Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a new framework for improving automated tutoring using adversarial reasoning, which surpasses GPT-4o in performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated tutors, there is a pressing need to address their shortcomings in pedagogical reasoning, including validating incorrect solutions and offering overly direct answers that hinder learning.

Method: The HPO framework uses structured adversarial synthesis where dialogue context is distilled by specialist agents and grounded in a moderated five-act debate involving opposing pedagogical critics.

Result: Using the MRBench dataset with 1,214 mathematics dialogues, the HPO framework achieves a Macro F1 score of 0.845, surpassing GPT-4o by 3.3% while utilizing 20 times fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that adversarial reasoning via the HPO framework can significantly enhance reliable pedagogical oversight in resource-limited settings, establishing its effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automated tutors to address educator shortages; however, they often fail at pedagogical reasoning, frequently validating incorrect student solutions (sycophancy) or providing overly direct answers that hinder learning. We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL approaches face challenges due to restrictive architectural assumptions, lack of scalable coordination techniques, and limitations caused by hierarchical or centralized structures.

Method: The authors propose Reinforcement Networks where agents are organized in DAGs, allowing for flexible credit assignment and decentralized coordination. They formalize training and inference methods and connect the framework to LevelEnv for reproducible evaluation.

Result: Reinforcement Networks improve performance in collaborative MARL tasks over existing baselines and unify different MARL approaches such as hierarchical and graph-structured methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Networks provide a foundational framework for scalable and structured MARL, opening directions for exploring richer graph structures, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration strategies.

Abstract: Modern AI systems often comprise multiple learnable components that can be naturally organized as graphs. A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.

### [602] [Heterogeneity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22941)
*Tianyi Hu,Zhiqiang Pu,Yuan Wang,Tenghai Qiu,Min Chen,Xin Yu*

TL;DR: The paper addresses heterogeneity in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by defining, quantifying, and utilizing it, proposing a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm and showing its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a rigorous definition and understanding of heterogeneity in the MARL community, which is crucial for policy diversity, functional differences, and environmental interactions.

Method: The paper categorizes heterogeneity into five types, provides mathematical definitions, proposes a quantification method, and designs a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm based on heterogeneity.

Result: The case studies and experiments show that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies heterogeneity among agents, offers better interpretability, and demonstrates stronger adaptability compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: This methodology enhances the understanding of heterogeneity in MARL and helps in developing practical algorithms for better agent collaboration and adaptability in diverse environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.

### [603] [A Rapid GeoSAM-Based Workflow for Multi-Temporal Glacier Delineation: Case Study from Svalbard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22855)
*Alexandru Hegyi*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-automatic workflow using GeoSAM for efficient glacier boundary delineation from Sentinel-2 imagery, showing spatially consistent results over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring glacier changes often requires consistent boundary delineation which is challenging to scale across diverse environments and long time series.

Method: The paper introduces a workflow combining image compositing, spectral index application, GeoSAM-guided segmentation, and post-processing to delineate glaciers from Sentinel-2 reflectance data.

Result: The approach successfully produced coherent glacier boundaries over multiple years in western Svalbard, with errors mostly in areas with water, terrain shadows, or high surface variability.

Conclusion: This workflow is a practical and scalable tool for glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment, although user inspection is still needed to refine results and adjust for specific local conditions.

Abstract: Consistent glacier boundary delineation is essential for monitoring glacier change, yet many existing approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments. In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines. The workflow is demonstrated in the Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region of western Svalbard across multiple years of the Sentinel-2 era. Results show that the approach produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies, while most errors are associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability. The reliance on derived RGB imagery makes the method flexible and transferable to other optical datasets, with improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution. Although user inspection remains necessary to filter incorrect polygons and adjust thresholds for local conditions, the workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment.

Abstract: Motion capture remains costly and complex to deploy, limiting use outside specialized laboratories. We present Mesquite, an open-source, low-cost inertial motion-capture system that combines a body-worn network of 15 IMU sensor nodes with a hip-worn Android smartphone for position tracking. A low-power wireless link streams quaternion orientations to a central USB dongle and a browser-based application for real-time visualization and recording. Built on modern web technologies -- WebGL for rendering, WebXR for SLAM, WebSerial and WebSockets for device and network I/O, and Progressive Web Apps for packaging -- the system runs cross-platform entirely in the browser. In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments. By leveraging IoT principles, edge processing, and a web-native stack, Mesquite lowers the barrier to motion capture for applications in entertainment, biomechanics, healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. We release hardware designs, firmware, and software under an open-source license (GNU GPL).

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework for reconstructing flow fields with uncertainty quantification, comparing its performance with traditional methods using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reconstruction of time-resolved flow fields from sparse measurements in thermal-fluid systems while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.

Method: The framework employs sparse variational Gaussian processes in Kolmogorov-Arnold network topology (SVGP-KAN), extending classical methods and enabling principled uncertainty quantification.

Result: SVGP-KAN achieves reconstruction accuracy matching traditional methods and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates across evaluation metrics using synthetic pulsed jet flow data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is robust for flow field reconstruction with meaningful uncertainty quantification, aiding experimental design in periodic flow systems.

Abstract: Reconstructing time-resolved flow fields from temporally sparse velocimetry measurements is critical for characterizing many complex thermal-fluid systems. We introduce a machine learning framework for uncertainty-aware flow reconstruction using sparse variational Gaussian processes in the Kolmogorov-Arnold network topology (SVGP-KAN). This approach extends the classical foundations of Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE) and Spectral Analysis Modal Methods (SAMM) while enabling principled epistemic uncertainty quantification. We perform a systematic comparison of our framework with the classical reconstruction methods as well as Kalman filtering. Using synthetic data from pulsed impingement jet flows, we assess performance across fractional PIV sampling rates ranging from 0.5% to 10%. Evaluation metrics include reconstruction error, generalization gap, structure preservation, and uncertainty calibration. Our SVGP-KAN methods achieve reconstruction accuracy comparable to established methods, while also providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that reliably indicate when and where predictions degrade. The results demonstrate a robust, data-driven framework for flow field reconstruction with meaningful uncertainty quantification and offer practical guidance for experimental design in periodic flows.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a generative AI-based tutoring system, LearnLM, in delivering effective, personalized education. It shows that AI tutoring can match or exceed traditional human tutor performance, demonstrating its potential to scale one-to-one tutoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how generative AI can democratize access to personalized tutoring, which is traditionally dependent on costly one-to-one human instruction.

Method: An exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 165 students was conducted in five UK secondary schools. LearnLM, a fine-tuned AI model, was paired with human-led, supervised tutoring sessions on the Eedi mathematics platform.

Result: LearnLM showed strong performance; tutors approved most AI-suggested messages with minimal edits, and students supported by LearnLM outperformed their peers tutored by human tutors alone on solving novel problems.

Conclusion: AI systems like LearnLM show promise for scaling personalized education effectively, with potential to improve outcomes and even inform tutors' pedagogical approaches.

Abstract: One-to-one tutoring is widely considered the gold standard for personalized education, yet it remains prohibitively expensive to scale. To evaluate whether generative AI might help expand access to this resource, we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with $N = 165$ students across five UK secondary schools. We integrated LearnLM -- a generative AI model fine-tuned for pedagogy -- into chat-based tutoring sessions on the Eedi mathematics platform. In the RCT, expert tutors directly supervised LearnLM, with the remit to revise each message it drafted until they would be satisfied sending it themselves. LearnLM proved to be a reliable source of pedagogical instruction, with supervising tutors approving 76.4% of its drafted messages making zero or minimal edits (i.e., changing only one or two characters). This translated into effective tutoring support: students guided by LearnLM performed at least as well as students chatting with human tutors on each learning outcome we measured. In fact, students who received support from LearnLM were 5.5 percentage points more likely to solve novel problems on subsequent topics (with a success rate of 66.2%) than those who received tutoring from human tutors alone (rate of 60.7%). In interviews, tutors highlighted LearnLM's strength at drafting Socratic questions that encouraged deeper reflection from students, with multiple tutors even reporting that they learned new pedagogical practices from the model. Overall, our results suggest that pedagogically fine-tuned AI tutoring systems may play a promising role in delivering effective, individualized learning support at scale.

### [607] [Pre-review to Peer review: Pitfalls of Automating Reviews using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22145)
*Akhil Pandey Akella,Harish Varma Siravuri,Shaurya Rohatgi*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the capabilities and challenges of using large language models (LLMs) in academic peer review. It investigates their potential as pre-review agents and highlights safety and alignment concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations and risks of using LLMs in the academic peer review process, focusing on their alignment with human judgment and post-publication metrics.

Method: An experimental study was conducted using OpenReview reviewer ratings and various frontier open-weight LLMs to generate paper reviews. Analysis included model-human correlation and comparison with post-publication metrics.

Result: LLMs showed weak correlation with human reviewers (0.15) but correlated strongly with post-publication metrics. They exhibited systematic overestimation bias and high confidence scores, suggesting misalignment. Despite risks, they demonstrated utility in pre-review screening.

Conclusion: LLMs could serve as pre-review screening tools in academic peer review, but their misalignment and overestimation biases limit their reliability as autonomous reviewers. The study emphasizes expanding safety frameworks for their use.

Abstract: Large Language Models are versatile general-task solvers, and their capabilities can truly assist people with scholarly peer review as \textit{pre-review} agents, if not as fully autonomous \textit{peer-review} agents. While incredibly beneficial, automating academic peer-review, as a concept, raises concerns surrounding safety, research integrity, and the validity of the academic peer-review process. The majority of the studies performing a systematic evaluation of frontier LLMs generating reviews across science disciplines miss the mark on addressing the alignment/misalignment of reviews along with the utility of LLM generated reviews when compared against publication outcomes such as \textbf{Citations}, \textbf{Hit-papers}, \textbf{Novelty}, and \textbf{Disruption}. This paper presents an experimental study in which we gathered ground-truth reviewer ratings from OpenReview and used various frontier open-weight LLMs to generate reviews of papers to gauge the safety and reliability of incorporating LLMs into the scientific review pipeline. Our findings demonstrate the utility of frontier open-weight LLMs as pre-review screening agents despite highlighting fundamental misalignment risks when deployed as autonomous reviewers. Our results show that all models exhibit weak correlation with human peer reviewers (0.15), with systematic overestimation bias of 3-5 points and uniformly high confidence scores (8.0-9.0/10) despite prediction errors. However, we also observed that LLM reviews correlate more strongly with post-publication metrics than with human scores, suggesting potential utility as pre-review screening tools. Our findings highlight the potential and address the pitfalls of automating peer reviews with language models. We open-sourced our dataset $D_{LMRSD}$ to help the research community expand the safety framework of automating scientific reviews.

TL;DR: This paper examines collaboration patterns in AI-driven cancer research, using co-authorship networks and machine learning methods to analyze factors influencing new, persistent, and discontinued collaborations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize interdisciplinary teamwork and resource allocation in AI-driven cancer research by understanding collaboration patterns.

Method: Analyzed 7,738 publications from Scopus (2000-2017), constructed 36 overlapping co-authorship networks, engineered features, and employed machine learning classifiers for pattern prediction and interpretation using SHAP.

Result: Random forest performed the best in recall across examined collaboration types. Discipline similarity influenced collaboration patterns differently, and productivity/seniority were linked to discontinued ties.

Conclusion: Insights from the research aim to improve teamwork efficiency and policy-making in interdisciplinary cancer research collaborations, particularly for AI applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cancer diagnosis and treatment. The intricate nature of this disease necessitates the collaboration of diverse stakeholders with varied expertise to ensure the effectiveness of cancer research. Despite its importance, forming effective interdisciplinary research teams remains challenging. Understanding and predicting collaboration patterns can help researchers, organizations, and policymakers optimize resources and foster impactful research. We examined co-authorship networks as a proxy for collaboration within AI-driven cancer research. Using 7,738 publications (2000-2017) from Scopus, we constructed 36 overlapping co-authorship networks representing new, persistent, and discontinued collaborations. We engineered both attribute-based and structure-based features and built four machine learning classifiers. Model interpretability was performed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Random forest achieved the highest recall for all three types of examined collaborations. The discipline similarity score emerged as a crucial factor, positively affecting new and persistent patterns while negatively impacting discontinued collaborations. Additionally, high productivity and seniority were positively associated with discontinued links. Our findings can guide the formation of effective research teams, enhance interdisciplinary cooperation, and inform strategic policy decisions.

### [609] [AETAS: Analysis of Evolving Temporal Affect and Semantics for Legal History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22196)
*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reproducible pipeline to analyze semantic changes in historical law documents using embeddings and visual analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide interpretable insights into semantic shifts in legal language using a reproducible framework.

Method: Lexical drift in historical documents is quantified using skip-gram embeddings, orthogonal Procrustes alignment, and dynamic statistical measures of displacement and neighborhood changes.

Result: The pipeline visualizes semantic trajectories, drift magnitudes, and legal axis movements, providing insights into linguistic evolution through penal and societal reforms.

Conclusion: This approach offers an auditable and interpretable pipeline for studying semantic shifts, applicable to other historical corpora beyond the Old Bailey Corpus.

Abstract: Digital-humanities work on semantic shift often alternates between handcrafted close readings and opaque embedding machinery. We present a reproducible expert-system style pipeline that quantifies and visualises lexical drift in the Old Bailey Corpus (1720--1913), coupling interpretable trajectories with legally meaningful axes. We bin proceedings by decade with dynamic merging for low-resource slices, train skip-gram embeddings, align spaces through orthogonal Procrustes, and measure both geometric displacement and neighborhood turnover. Three visual analytics outputs, which are drift magnitudes, semantic trajectories, and movement along a mercy-versus-retribution axis, expose how justice, crime, poverty, and insanity evolve with penal reforms, transportation debates, and Victorian moral politics. The pipeline is implemented as auditable scripts so results can be reproduced in other historical corpora.

*Frank Tian-Fang Ye,Xiaozi Gao*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The study analyzes sentiment and moral reasoning behind marriage attitudes in China by examining social media data, revealing patterns of positivity, negativity, and neutrality across platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The decline in China's marriage registrations necessitates understanding public attitudes toward marriage, focusing on emotional sentiments and moral reasoning.

Method: 219,358 marriage-related posts from Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu were analyzed using LLM-assisted content analysis, guided by Shweder's Big Three moral ethics (Autonomy, Community, Divinity).

Result: Platform differences were identified: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was mainly neutral. Posts invoking moral ethics showed specific sentiment patterns – Autonomy and Community ethics were negative, while Divinity was neutral or positive.

Conclusion: Negative attitudes toward marriage stem from concerns about personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations. The study highlights LLMs' effectiveness for analysis and suggests culturally informed policy solutions to address marriage decline in China.

Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges in solving wave propagation problems with random field approximations while ensuring scalability and accuracy.

Method: Intrusive stochastic Galerkin technique with polynomial chaos expansion is employed, converting stochastic PDEs into deterministic equations. Domain decomposition-based solvers and a conjugate gradient iterative method with Neumann-Neumann preconditioner are used for computation.

Result: Efficient scalability of the proposed approach was demonstrated.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently handles computational challenges in acoustic wave problems involving stochastic inputs, showcasing scalability and performance.

Abstract: An acoustic wave propagation problem with a log normal random field approximation for wave speed is solved using a sampling-free intrusive stochastic Galerkin approach. The stochastic partial differential equation with the inputs and outputs expanded using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is transformed into a set of deterministic PDEs and further to a system of linear equations. Domain decomposition (DD)-based solvers are utilized to handle the overwhelming computational cost for the resulting system with increasing mesh size, time step and number of random parameters. A conjugate gradient iterative solver with a two-level Neumann-Neumann preconditioner is applied here showing their efficient scalabilities.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study examines the effects of MRI scanner magnetic field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T) on deep learning-based segmentation models across three datasets, revealing that field strength significantly impacts performance, especially for soft-tissue segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how MRI scanner magnetic field strength influences the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms, given its potential as a confounding factor in AI evaluations.

Method: Three nnU-Net-based segmentation models were trained and evaluated on MRI datasets stratified by field strength. Performance differences were examined using UMAP-based clustering and radiomic analysis.

Result: Models trained on 3.0T data outperformed those trained on 1.5T or combined data for breast tumor and pancreas segmentation, while cervical spine models showed minor field-strength dependency.

Conclusion: Magnetic field strength in training data significantly affects segmentation model performance, particularly for soft tissues. Field strength should be factored in when evaluating AI applications for MRI.

Abstract: This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p<0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.

*Haozhe Jia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores improving capsule endoscopy imaging using a diffusion-based super-resolution framework for better resolution and anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low resolution of capsule endoscopy images makes it challenging to identify fine mucosal textures and subtle pathological features necessary for early diagnosis.

Method: A diffusion-based super-resolution framework using the SR3 model was applied to map low-resolution to high-resolution images using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs).

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional interpolation and GAN-based approaches, achieving PSNR up to 29.3 dB and SSIM up to 0.71 with improvements to structural fidelity and anatomical detail preservation.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based super-resolution can greatly enhance capsule endoscopy imaging, supporting non-invasive medical imaging by addressing resolution limitations.

Abstract: Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.
  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.
  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid virtual biopsy pipeline combining deep learning with radiomics features for brain tumor classification, achieving improved performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in brain tumor diagnosis within low-resource clinical environments and limitations in current deep learning methods such as computational burden and interpretability.

Method: A hybrid pipeline integrates a MobileNetV2-based CNN for image classification with handcrafted radiomics features fused using a RandomForest classifier to enhance explainability and robustness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that combining CNN and radiomics features improves classification performance and provides increased robustness under adverse imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively supports brain tumor classification in imaging-constrained environments while emphasizing decision support rather than replacing clinical procedures.

Abstract: Timely brain tumor diagnosis remains challenging in low-resource clinical environments where expert neuroradiology interpretation, high-end MRI hardware, and invasive biopsy procedures may be limited. Although deep learning has achieved strong performance in brain tumor analysis, real-world adoption is constrained by computational demands, dataset shift across scanners, and limited interpretability. This paper presents a prototype virtual biopsy pipeline for four-class classification of 2D brain MRI images using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) and complementary radiomics-style handcrafted features. A MobileNetV2-based CNN is trained for classification, while an interpretable radiomics branch extracts eight features capturing lesion shape, intensity statistics, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors. A late fusion strategy concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features and trains a RandomForest classifier on the fused representation. Explainability is provided via Grad-CAM visualizations and radiomics feature importance analysis. Experiments on a public Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset show improved validation performance for fusion relative to single-branch baselines, while robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise highlight sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions. The system is framed as decision support and not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or histopathology.

TL;DR: A novel complex-valued Swin Transformer network is proposed for reconstructing high-quality SMWI images from reduced k-space MRI data, supporting faster scans in Parkinson's diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the scanning time for high-resolution SMWI acquisition to make it more clinically feasible for diagnosing Parkinson's disease.

Method: A complex-valued Swin Transformer-based neural network performs super-resolution reconstruction of multi-echo MRI data, producing high-resolution SMWI from reduced k-space inputs.

Result: Experimental results show a structural similarity of 0.9116 and mean squared error of 0.076 for reconstructed SMWI, preserving critical diagnostic features.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables faster and efficient neuroimaging by reconstructing diagnostic-quality SMWI from reduced scans, enhancing clinical workflows for Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Susceptibility Map Weighted Imaging (SMWI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique used to detect nigral hyperintensity in Parkinsons disease. However, full resolution SMWI acquisition is limited by long scan times. Efficient reconstruction methods are therefore required to generate high quality SMWI from reduced k space data while preserving diagnostic relevance. In this work, we propose a complex valued Swin Transformer based network for super resolution reconstruction of multi echo MRI data. The proposed method reconstructs high quality SMWI images from low resolution k space inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a structural similarity index of 0.9116 and a mean squared error of 0.076 when reconstructing SMWI from 256 by 256 k space data, while maintaining critical diagnostic features. This approach enables high quality SMWI reconstruction from reduced k space sampling, leading to shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail. The proposed method has the potential to improve the clinical applicability of SMWI for Parkinsons disease and support faster and more efficient neuroimaging workflows.

*Kai-Hsiang Hsieh,Monyneath Yim,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Jui-Chiu Chiang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MEGA-PCC is a learning-based framework for jointly compressing 3D point cloud geometry and attributes more efficiently through an end-to-end approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and optimize 3D point cloud compression by eliminating the need for recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning.

Method: The framework uses a shared encoder for unified latent representation and dual decoders for geometry and attribute reconstruction, enhanced by a Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) for better entropy coding.

Result: MEGA-PCC achieves better rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to traditional and learning-based baselines.

Conclusion: This framework advances AI-based point cloud compression by enabling efficient, end-to-end joint compression and reducing system complexity.

Abstract: Joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes is essential for efficient 3D data representation. Existing methods often rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attribute bitstreams in inference, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEGA-PCC, a fully end-to-end, learning-based framework featuring two specialized models for joint compression. The main compression model employs a shared encoder that encodes both geometry and attribute information into a unified latent representation, followed by dual decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and then attributes. Complementing this, the Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) enhances entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations to improve probability estimation. Both models are built on the Mamba architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and rich contextual features. By eliminating the need for recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning, MEGA-PCC enables data-driven bitrate allocation during training and simplifies the overall pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines, offering a powerful solution for AI-driven point cloud compression.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT aims to reduce radiation dose but suffers from streak artifacts due to ill-posed reconstruction conditions.

Method: The approach introduces semantic feature contrastive learning loss, combined with a three-stage U-Net architecture focusing on coarse reconstruction, detail refinement, and semantic similarity.

Result: Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections show improved reconstruction quality and faster processing over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances image quality while keeping computational complexity low, making it useful for practical CT applications.

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical imaging, with sparse-view reconstruction offering an effective way to reduce radiation dose. However, ill-posed conditions often result in severe streak artifacts. Recent advances in deep learning-based methods have improved reconstruction quality, but challenges still remain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic feature contrastive learning loss function that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow latent spaces. Our approach utilizes a three-stage U-Net-based architecture: one for coarse reconstruction, one for detail refinement, and one for semantic similarity measurement. Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing compared to other algorithms. The results show significant improvements in image quality while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction.

*Minghao Dong,Xinyang Luo,Xujian Ouyang,Yongshun Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, to improve imaging quality in Compton cameras by directly establishing the relationship between gamma detection events and source distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction methods for Compton cameras suffer from artifacts, deformations, and systematic errors due to back-projection and device performance limitations.

Method: The authors developed SwinCCIR, an end-to-end deep learning framework using swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, trained on both simulated and real datasets.

Result: SwinCCIR effectively mitigates the imaging issues associated with conventional algorithms, as experimental tests demonstrated enhanced performance.

Conclusion: This innovative deep learning approach holds significant potential for practical implementation in gamma imaging via Compton cameras.

Abstract: Compton cameras (CCs) are a kind of gamma cameras which are designed to determine the directions of incident gammas based on the Compton scatter. However, the reconstruction of CCs face problems of severe artifacts and deformation due to the fundamental reconstruction principle of back-projection of Compton cones. Besides, a part of systematic errors originated from the performance of devices are hard to remove through calibration, leading to deterioration of imaging quality. Iterative algorithms and deep-learning based methods have been widely used to improve reconstruction. But most of them are optimization based on the results of back-projection. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, for CC imaging. Through adopting swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, we established the relationship between the list-mode events and the radioactive source distribution. SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical dataset. The experimental results indicate that SwinCCIR effectively overcomes problems of conventional CC imaging, which are expected to be implemented in practical applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to improve automated chest X-ray medical report generation using enhanced image representations with cross-modal transformers and medical-domain pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce radiologist workload, alleviate stress, and lower misdiagnosis risks in medical report generation by addressing the limitations of current methods.

Method: The proposed method, Enhanced Image Representations (EIR), utilizes cross-modal transformers to integrate metadata and visual data while mitigating information asymmetry. It also employs medical-domain pre-trained models to address the domain gap in chest X-ray image encoding.

Result: The method was experimentally validated on the MIMIC and Open-I datasets, showing improved performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) proves effective in generating accurate medical reports, overcoming distribution mismatch and domain gaps in image representation.

Abstract: Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple "Add and LayerNorm" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sparsely sampled and existing methods are either limited to high-frequency data or conservative systems.

Method: Reformulates the inference problem as a stochastic control problem and uses geometry-driven path augmentation based on the system's invariant density to infer dynamics, without relying on parametric models.

Result: The proposed method successfully recovers stochastic dynamics from highly undersampled data, surpassing current methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification is an effective strategy for learning dynamics from sparse data.

Abstract: How can we learn the laws underlying the dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sampled sparsely in time? Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods.

Abstract: We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing high-dimensional spatially distributed coefficients in PDE-constrained inverse problems under sparse observations.

Method: Integrating a latent diffusion model with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of PDEs. Gradients are propagated using adjoint-based and reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

Result: LD-DIM improves reconstruction stability, numerical accuracy, and effectively handles sharp discontinuities in conductivity fields compared to PINNs and VAE-based methods.

Conclusion: LD-DIM provides a robust framework for solving inverse problems in complex domains, demonstrating better stability and reconstruction quality than existing approaches while maintaining sharp structural features.

Abstract: We present a latent diffusion-based differentiable inversion method (LD-DIM) for PDE-constrained inverse problems involving high-dimensional spatially distributed coefficients. LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Python-based quantum software frameworks face challenges such as runtime errors, limited scalability, and inefficiency, necessitating better tools for robust quantum computing.

Method: The authors developed LogosQ as a hardware-independent library in Rust. It employs compile-time type safety to avoid runtime errors, introduces technologies like direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallelism, and FFT-optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, and achieves enhanced performance.

Result: LogosQ demonstrated superior speedups (up to 900x in QFT tasks) compared to Python and Julia-based quantum libraries and matched the performance of Q#. Additionally, it delivered stable and accurate results in VQE experiments on challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: LogosQ provides a reliable and efficient solution for quantum software development by combining Rust's safety features with cutting-edge optimizations, raising the standard for quantum simulation workflows.

Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of exhaustive experimental testing caused by the sensitivity of CFRC-AMs performance to process and material parameters.

Method: Integrated Latin Hypercube Sampling with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) for multi-target prediction of mechanical and manufacturing properties.

Result: The model achieved superior predictive accuracy (MAPE = 12.33%) compared to commonly used models and identified reinforcement strategy as a key factor influencing performance.

Conclusion: The LHS and SE-WDNN approach offers a data-efficient, interpretable method for optimizing parameters, balancing mechanical performance and manufacturing metrics in CFRC-AM.

Abstract: Continuous fiber-reinforced composite manufactured by additive manufacturing (CFRC-AM) offers opportunities for printing lightweight materials with high specific strength. However, their performance is sensitive to the interaction of process and material parameters, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. In this study, we introduce a data-efficient, multi-input, multi-target learning approach that integrates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)-guided experimentation with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) to jointly predict multiple mechanical and manufacturing properties of CFRC-AMs based on different manufacturing parameters. We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p <= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics.

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) exhibit deficiencies compared to traditional methods like FDTD in electromagnetism; this study proposes hybrid strategies to close the performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for methodologies that outperform or match the advantages of established approaches like FDTD and FEM in electromagnetism.

Method: Hybrid strategies integrating time marching, causality-aware weighting, two-stage interface continuity loss, and local Poynting-based regularizers were used to address accuracy, energy drift, and causality collapse issues.

Result: Achieved high field accuracy (average 0.09% NRMSE, 1.01% L² error) and energy conservation (0.024% relative energy mismatch) in a 2D PEC cavity, using physics-based residual losses.

Conclusion: PINNs can reach competitive accuracy and energy consistency with FDTD in electromagnetic problems, making them promising alternatives.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a methodology that aims to solve physical systems by directly embedding PDE constraints into the neural network training process. In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.
  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.
  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Layer Attentive Pooling (LAP) and a lightweight backend speaker model, improving speaker verification by aggregating inter-layer representations dynamically with outstanding performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker verification often relies on leveraging inter-layer outputs from pre-trained models. However, existing methods primarily use static aggregation strategies, limiting their performance. This research is motivated by the need for more dynamic and effective aggregation methods to enhance speaker verification outcomes.

Method: The researchers introduce the Layer Attentive Pooling (LAP) method, which dynamically weights and aggregates inter-layer outputs using max pooling. They also propose a lightweight backend speaker model combining LAP and Attentive Statistical Temporal Pooling (ASTP) to extract speaker embeddings efficiently.

Result: The proposed LAP-based approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the VoxCeleb benchmark, significantly reducing training time while maintaining high accuracy for speaker verification.

Conclusion: LAP effectively aggregates multi-layer features for speaker verification, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to static averaging methods. Its dynamic weighting mechanism highlights the potential for capturing speaker-specific characteristics.

Abstract: Recent speaker verification studies have achieved notable success by leveraging layer-wise output from pre-trained Transformer models. However, few have explored the advancements in aggregating these multi-level features beyond the static weighted average. We present Layer Attentive Pooling (LAP), a novel strategy for aggregating inter-layer representations from pre-trained speech models for speaker verification. LAP assesses the significance of each layer from multiple perspectives time-dynamically, and employs max pooling instead of averaging. Additionally, we propose a lightweight backend speaker model comprising LAP and Attentive Statistical Temporal Pooling (ASTP) to extract speaker embeddings from pre-trained model output. Experiments on the VoxCeleb benchmark reveal that our compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while greatly reducing the training time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying speech emotion recognition systems on mobile devices, considering the computational demands of existing transformer architectures.

Method: The method involves using DistilHuBERT, an 8-bit quantized transformer model, combined with rigorous cross-validation and cross-corpus training to enhance accuracy and generalization.

Result: The proposed system achieves a 92% parameter reduction, 61.4% unweighted accuracy, and improved metrics through cross-corpus training while maintaining speaker independence. It also provides insights into emotional prediction clustering caused by theatrical expressions.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, making speech emotion recognition feasible for mobile applications while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has significant potential for mobile applications, yet deployment remains constrained by the computational demands of state-of-the-art transformer architectures. This paper presents a mobile-efficient SER system based on DistilHuBERT, a distilled and 8-bit quantized transformer that achieves 92% parameter reduction compared to full-scale Wav2Vec 2.0 models while maintaining competitive accuracy. We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness. These findings establish a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, enabling practical affect recognition on resource-constrained mobile devices.

Result: Quantitative evidence supports that skill plays a significant role in determining success on fantasy cricket platforms.

Conclusion: Online fantasy cricket outcomes are influenced significantly by player skill rather than chance, as validated by extensive simulations and analysis.

Abstract: Online fantasy cricket has emerged as large-scale competitive systems in which participants construct virtual teams and compete based on real-world player performances. This massive growth has been accompanied by important questions about whether outcomes are primarily driven by skill or chance. We develop a statistical framework to assess the role of skill in determining success on these platforms. We construct and analyze a range of deterministic and stochastic team selection strategies, based on recent form, historical statistics, statistical optimization, and multi-criteria decision making. Strategy performance is evaluated based on points, ranks, and payoff under two contest structures Mega and 4x or Nothing. An extensive comparison between different strategies is made to find an optimal set of strategies. To capture adaptive behavior, we further introduce a dynamic tournament model in which agent populations evolve through a softmax reweighting mechanism proportional to positive payoff realizations. We demonstrate our work by running extensive numerical experiments on the IPL 2024 dataset. The results provide quantitative evidence in favor of the skill element present in online fantasy cricket platforms.

Result: The paper showed the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria in the model, provided a constructive counterexample showing non-monotonicity, and demonstrated the rapid convergence of their gradient-based algorithm to approximate solutions.

Conclusion: The approach provides a useful framework to analyze political competition and demonstrates viable algorithms for finding solutions, despite theoretical limitations such as non-monotonicity in certain conditions.

Abstract: We formulate two-party policy competition as a two-player non-cooperative game, generalizing Lin et al.'s work (2021). Each party selects a real-valued policy vector as its strategy from a compact subset of Euclidean space, and a voter's utility for a policy is given by the inner product with their preference vector. To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $ε$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/ε$.

### [633] [UniFi: Combining Irregularly Sampled CSI from Diverse Communication Packets and Frequency Bands for Wi-Fi Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22143)
*Gaofeng Dong,Kang Yang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: UniFi is a Wi-Fi Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework that eliminates intrusive packet injection by analyzing irregularly sampled CSI across multiple bands, achieving high accuracy without degrading communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Wi-Fi sensing systems that degrade communication by relying on high-rate probing packets or auxiliary packet injection.

Method: UniFi uses a CSI sanitization pipeline for heterogeneous packet harmonization and burst removal, along with a time-aware attention model to process non-uniform CSI sequences. It also introduces the CommCSI-HAR dataset for real-world evaluation.

Result: UniFi achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on evaluations with compact model size while fully preserving communication throughput.

Conclusion: UniFi provides an efficient ISAC framework, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness for Wi-Fi sensing without intrusive packet injections.

Abstract: Existing Wi-Fi sensing systems rely on injecting high-rate probing packets to extract channel state information (CSI), leading to communication degradation and poor deployability. Although Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a promising direction, existing solutions still rely on auxiliary packet injection because they exploit only CSI from data frames. We present UniFi, the first Wi-Fi-based ISAC framework that fully eliminates intrusive packet injection by directly exploiting irregularly sampled CSI from diverse communication packets across multiple frequency bands. UniFi integrates a CSI sanitization pipeline to harmonize heterogeneous packets and remove burst-induced redundancy, together with a time-aware attention model that learns directly from non-uniform CSI sequences without resampling. We further introduce CommCSI-HAR, the first dataset with irregularly sampled CSI from real-world dual-band communication traffic. Extensive evaluations on this dataset and four public benchmarks show that UniFi achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a compact model size, while fully preserving communication throughput.

*Hanbeot Park,Yunjeong Cho,Hunhee Kim*

TL;DR: This paper introduces an EEG-to-Voice method to reconstruct speech from EEG signals without temporal alignment by generating mel-spectrograms and synthesizing speech using pretrained modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations like low spatial resolution, noise, and lack of temporal alignment in restoring speech from EEG, particularly for imagined speech.

Method: EEG signals are processed into mel-spectrograms using a subject-specific generator. Pretrained vocoder and ASR modules synthesize and decode speech, with optional language model correction. Transfer learning adapts spoken speech models for imagined speech.

Result: Stable acoustic reconstruction and accurate linguistic decoding observed for both spoken and imagined speech under 2 s and 4 s utterances. Errors slightly increased in longer sentences but language model correction improved decoding accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves effective EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for both spoken and imagined speech, validating its feasibility and practicality for brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Restoring speech communication from neural signals is a central goal of brain-computer interface research, yet EEG-based speech reconstruction remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution, susceptibility to noise, and the absence of temporally aligned acoustic targets in imagined speech. In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses water scarcity challenges in agriculture, particularly in Tunisia, by developing resource-efficient solutions using advanced predictive techniques.

Method: The research utilized IoT sensors for data collection (CO2, light, etc.) from 21 basil crops and trained/testing three ML models—Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN)—for yield prediction.

Result: LSTM achieved 99% accuracy but was resource-intensive; DNN hit 98% accuracy with balanced computational efficiency, while LR delivered rapid, basic predictions with minimal resource requirements.

Conclusion: DNN demonstrates suitability for responsive, high-accuracy agricultural decision systems; LR is practical for low-complexity scenarios, providing insight into the balance between accuracy and computational constraints of ML models.

Abstract: As agriculture faces increasing pressure from water scarcity, especially in regions like Tunisia, innovative, resource-efficient solutions are urgently needed. This work explores the integration of indoor vertical hydroponics with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize basil yield while saving water. This research develops a prediction system that uses different ML models and assesses their performance. The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications. These performance trade-offs highlight the potential of DNN-based solutions for building responsive, high-accuracy decision-support systems tailored to agricultural environments, making it suitable for future edge-device deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in modeling EEG signals due to noise, subject variability, and multi-scale dynamics.

Method: PaperNet incorporates temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block, with subject-independent training on the BEED dataset.

Result: The model achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.96 on the test set with only 0.6M parameters, demonstrating balanced performance across all classes and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PaperNet demonstrates that combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent modeling effectively improves EEG classification performance while being suitable for deployment on resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals contain rich temporal-spectral structure but are difficult to model due to noise, subject variability, and multi-scale dynamics. Lightweight deep learning models have shown promise, yet many either rely solely on local convolutions or require heavy recurrent modules. This paper presents PaperNet, a compact hybrid architecture that combines temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block which is used for short-window classification. Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process. These results indicate that carefully combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent context modeling can yield strong EEG classification performance without excessive computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address sampling challenges in constrained, non-convex spaces, specifically spaces with complex punctured supports.

Method: The approach combines a spatially adaptive temperature with a repulsive drift, ensuring samples remain within constrained and valid regions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms unconstrained sampling in experiments involving 2D Gaussian mixture models and MIMO symbol detection tasks.

Conclusion: Shielded LMC offers a novel solution for constrained samplers in punctured non-convex domains, proving effective through experimental validation.

Abstract: We introduce shielded Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), a constrained sampler inspired by navigation functions, capable of sampling from unnormalized target distributions defined over punctured supports. In other words, this approach samples from non-convex spaces defined as convex sets with convex holes. This defines a novel and challenging problem in constrained sampling. To do so, the sampler incorporates a combination of a spatially adaptive temperature and a repulsive drift to ensure that samples remain within the feasible region. Experiments on a 2D Gaussian mixture and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbol detection showcase the advantages of the proposed shielded LMC in contrast to unconstrained cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the computational efficiency of solving constrained minimax problems under specific properties like nonconvex-strongly-concave structures.

Method: The authors propose an augmented Lagrangian method and a specialized first-order technique leveraging strong concavity for solving subproblems effectively.

Result: The method achieves an operation complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-3.5} \log\varepsilon^{-1})$, outperforming earlier results by improving complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-0.5}$.

Conclusion: This research introduces efficient algorithmic frameworks for constrained minimax problems, setting new benchmarks for operation complexity in this domain.

Abstract: In this paper we study a nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax problem. Specifically, we propose a first-order augmented Lagrangian method for solving it, whose subproblems are nonconvex-strongly-concave unconstrained minimax problems and suitably solved by a first-order method developed in this paper that leverages the strong concavity structure. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed method achieves an \emph{operation complexity} of $O(\varepsilon^{-3.5}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of its fundamental operations, for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the constrained minimax problem, which improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-0.5}$.

### [639] [Clipped Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Refined Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23178)
*Zijian Liu*

TL;DR: The paper provides refined analysis and faster convergence rates for Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under heavy-tailed noise, introducing the concept of "generalized effective dimension."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become important in modern machine learning due to empirical relevance, but existing techniques face limitations in achieving faster rates with refined analyses.

Method: The authors improve upon previously known results by utilizing Freedman's inequality more effectively and introducing finer error bounds for gradient clipping under heavy-tailed noise, incorporating the concept of "generalized effective dimension."

Result: New faster convergence rates for Clipped SGD are achieved, with lower bounds established. The improved analysis offers better upper bounds for both high-probability and expectation-based convergence, achieving optimality.

Conclusion: The refined analysis establishes optimal convergence guarantees for Clipped SGD under certain conditions, providing theoretical insights and practical value for optimizing problems with heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\frak p}$-th moment where ${\frak p}\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\frak l}^{\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\frak l}\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\in\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}d_{\rm eff}^{-1/2{\frak p}}\ln^{1-1/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ and ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2d_{\rm eff}^{-1/{\frak p}}\ln^{2-2/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\rm eff}\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.

### [640] [Constraint programming model and biased random-key genetic algorithm for the single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23150)
*Vítor A. Barbosa,Rafael A. Melo*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses a single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays aiming to minimize the makespan, using a constraint programming (CP) model and a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). BRKGA was found to efficiently provide high-quality solutions within short computational times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the strongly NP-hard problem of scheduling tasks with exact delays on a single machine to minimize the makespan while avoiding preemption, and explore efficient solution approaches.

Method: The study proposes a CP model using global constraints and a BRKGA that integrates components like initial solution generation, periodic restarts, shakes, and local search. The BRKGA's decoder prioritizes exploration efficiency.

Result: Computational tests reveal that the BRKGA efficiently explores the solution space, yielding high-quality approximate solutions quickly. It outperforms CP under limited computational settings and demonstrates notable improvements with shake and local search components.

Conclusion: Both approaches show distinct strengths. BRKGA efficiently finds solutions within limited time, while CP excels under extended computational resources. The combined use of shake and local search substantially enhances BRKGA's performance.

Abstract: We consider the strongly NP-hard single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan. In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal stopping problems with multiple exercise opportunities in high dimensions pose significant computational challenges, particularly due to recursive dependencies.

Method: The approach combines Dynamic Programming Principle with neural network-based value function approximation and addresses errors in discrete and continuous cases.

Result: Numerical experiments on examples like American basket options and nonlinear utility maximization show the framework's efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: This framework effectively handles complex high-dimensional multiple optimal stopping problems, offering a promising solution for practical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for solving multiple optimal stopping problems in high dimensions. While deep learning has recently shown promise for single stopping problems, the multiple exercise case involves complex recursive dependencies that remain challenging. We address this by combining the Dynamic Programming Principle with neural network approximation of the value function. Unlike policy-search methods, our algorithm explicitly learns the value surface. We first consider the discrete-time problem and analyze neural network training error. We then turn to continuous problems and analyze the additional error due to the discretization of the underlying stochastic processes. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional American basket options and nonlinear utility maximization demonstrate that our method provides an efficient and scalable method for the multiple optimal stopping problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing safety-critical, dynamic decision-making environments, where risk levels and conditions evolve over time.

Method: The method uses Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure and develops algorithms capturing environmental dynamics via function and risk-level variation metrics under first-order and zeroth-order scenarios.

Result: The developed algorithms show adaptability in dynamic, non-stationary, and risk-sensitive environments, supported by dynamic regret analysis and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides effective risk-averse online optimization algorithms that cater to varying risk levels and environmental dynamics with justified theoretical and experimental performance.

Abstract: In safety-critical decision-making, the environment may evolve over time, and the learner adjusts its risk level accordingly. This work investigates risk-averse online optimization in dynamic environments with varying risk levels, employing Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. To capture the dynamics of the environment and risk levels, we employ the function variation metric and introduce a novel risk-level variation metric. Two information settings are considered: a first-order scenario, where the learner observes both function values and their gradients; and a zeroth-order scenario, where only function evaluations are available. For both cases, we develop risk-averse learning algorithms with a limited sampling budget and analyze their dynamic regret bounds in terms of function variation, risk-level variation, and the total number of samples. The regret analysis demonstrates the adaptability of the algorithms in non-stationary and risk-sensitive settings. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the methods.

*Kooktae Lee,Julian Martinez*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of classical Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) by proposing a stochastic perturbation to avoid symmetry-induced stalling in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome gradient cancellation and symmetry-induced stalling in classical SMC for multi-agent systems, which limits effective trajectory coverage.

Method: The authors propose introducing a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term to the SMC framework. A mathematical proof supports its ability to escape zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining bounded motion.

Result: Simulations show the proposed stochastic SMC avoids transient stalling and symmetry-axis-constrained motion, and agent trajectories remain bounded.

Conclusion: The modified stochastic SMC successfully addresses limitations of gradient cancellations and symmetry issues, improving multi-agent coverage performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent ergodic coverage via Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) provides a principled framework for driving a team of agents so that their collective time-averaged trajectories match a prescribed spatial distribution. While classical SMC has demonstrated empirical success, it can suffer from gradient cancellation, particularly when agents are initialized near symmetry points of the target distribution, leading to undesirable behaviors such as stalling or motion constrained along symmetry axes. In this work, we rigorously characterize the initial conditions and symmetry-induced invariant manifolds that give rise to such directional degeneracy in first-order agent dynamics. To address this, we introduce a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term and prove that the resulting dynamics ensure almost-sure escape from zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining mean-square boundedness of agent trajectories. Simulations on symmetric multi-modal reference distributions demonstrate that the proposed stochastic SMC effectively mitigates transient stalling and axis-constrained motion, while ensuring that all agent trajectories remain bounded within the domain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dimensionality reduction framework for reach-avoid (RA) games, splitting them into horizontal and vertical sub-games for effective handling in three spatial dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the dimensionality challenges of three-dimensional RA games while considering complex dynamics and ensuring solution optimality.

Method: The proposed method decomposes the RA game into horizontal and vertical sub-games solvable by HJ reachability analysis, integrates a tracking control algorithm, and proves capture guarantees.

Result: Numerical simulations and physics simulator validations demonstrate that the proposed decomposition preserves optimality and successfully captures quadrotors in 3D space.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective RA game solutions in 3D space, addressing high dimensionality and ensuring guarantees for non-trivial dynamics.

Abstract: Reach-avoid (RA) games have significant applications in security and defense, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via numerical simulations, showing that the decomposition maintains optimality and guarantees in the original problem. Our methods are also validated in a Gazebo physics simulator, achieving successful capture of quadrotors in three spatial dimensions space for the first time to the best of our knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the inefficiencies and computational challenges of power allocation in wireless communication networks, especially under dynamic user loads.

Method: The proposed method uses a hybrid Tree-Transformer architecture to compress user features via a binary tree into a global root representation, applies a Transformer encoder to the root, and decodes per-user power efficiently.

Result: The model yields near-optimal performance in the max-min fairness problem within cell-free massive MIMO systems, while significantly lowering inference time compared to traditional Transformer models.

Conclusion: The Tree-Transformer architecture enables scalable power allocation across large, varying user sets efficiently, avoiding retraining or extensive computational costs.

Abstract: Power allocation remains a fundamental challenge in wireless communication networks, particularly under dynamic user loads and large-scale deployments. While Transformerbased models have demonstrated strong performance, their computational cost scales poorly with the number of users. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid Tree-Transformer architecture that achieves scalable per-user power allocation. Our model compresses user features via a binary tree into a global root representation, applies a Transformer encoder solely to this root, and decodes per-user uplink and downlink powers through a shared decoder. This design achieves logarithmic depth and linear total complexity, enabling efficient inference across large and variable user sets without retraining or architectural changes. We evaluate our model on the max-min fairness problem in cellfree massive MIMO systems and demonstrate that it achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing inference time compared to full-attention baselines.

### [647] [Revealing design archetypes and flexibility in e-molecule import pathways using Modeling to Generate Alternatives and interpretable machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23284)
*Mahdi Kchaou,Francesco Contino,Diederik Coppitters*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores diverse near-cost-optimal green e-molecule import solutions for Europe, considering real-world constraints and uncertainties. Using modeling and machine learning, the study identifies flexible pathways without strict reliance on solar, wind, or storage technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitation of single cost-optimal solutions for green e-molecule imports, which often become impractical due to real-world regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints.

Method: The authors generate a range of near-cost-optimal alternatives using Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) and interpret the solution space with machine learning to account for uncertainties.

Result: The study uncovers a broad range of flexible near-optimal import pathways for hydrogen carriers, showing adaptability to constraints. Solar, wind, and storage are not essential to remain within a 10% cost margin.

Conclusion: Real-world energy transition plans should consider diverse near-optimal solutions rather than a single optimal design, accommodating constraints and uncertainties while achieving cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Given the central role of green e-molecule imports in the European energy transition, many studies optimize import pathways and identify a single cost-optimal solution. However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.

*Julia Kończal,Michał Balcerek,Krzysztof Burnecki*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: This paper studies how climate variability influences the pricing of CAT bonds and evaluates predictive machine learning models for better forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters are increasing in frequency and severity, raising the demand for effective risk management tools like CAT bonds, which shift disaster risk to investors.

Method: The authors incorporated climate indicators like Oceanic Niño Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation into prediction models and compared various machine learning methods, including random forest and extreme gradient boosting, against linear regression.

Result: Incorporating climate-related data enhanced prediction accuracy across methods, with extremely randomized trees producing the best performance (lowest RMSE).

Conclusion: Climate variability significantly impacts CAT bond pricing, and advanced machine learning models successfully capture these complex relationships, enabling improved risk assessment.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased the need for effective tools to manage catastrophe risk. Catastrophe (CAT) bonds allow the transfer of part of this risk to investors, offering an alternative to traditional reinsurance. This paper examines the role of climate variability in CAT bond pricing and evaluates the predictive performance of various machine learning models in forecasting CAT bond coupons. We combine features typically used in the literature with a new set of climate indicators, including Oceanic Ni{ñ}o Index, Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Pacific-North American pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index, and sea surface temperatures. We compare the performance of linear regression with several machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, gradient boosting, extremely randomized trees, and extreme gradient boosting. Our results show that including climate-related variables improves predictive accuracy across all models, with extremely randomized trees achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE). These findings suggest that large-scale climate variability has a measurable influence on CAT bond pricing and that machine learning methods can effectively capture these complex relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional RISs in wave manipulation and explore the potential of BD-RIS for improved efficiency in configuring amplitude and phase of waves in 6G networks.

Method: Systematic review of BD-RIS principles, algorithms for passive beamforming design, case study using different algorithms, analysis of hybrid quantum-classical ML models for 6G beam prediction.

Result: Demonstrated the advantages of BD-RIS, tested beamforming algorithms, and assessed quantum-ML models for improving beam prediction in real-world 6G scenarios.

Conclusion: BD-RIS shows promising advancements in wave manipulation and performance enhancement opportunities in 6G networks, with quantum technologies aiding practical deployment.

Abstract: A beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is an innovative type of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that has recently been proposed and is considered a revolutionary advancement in wave manipulation. Unlike the mutually disconnected arrangement of elements in traditional RISs, BD-RIS creates cost-effective and simple inter-element connections, allowing for greater freedom in configuring the amplitude and phase of impinging waves. However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset. Consequently, we derive useful insights about the practical implications of BD-RIS.

*Xiao Zhou,Yuze Sun,Jie Wu,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model to accurately map the Madden-Julian Oscillation's (MJO) life cycle and improve monitoring frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in defining the MJO's life cycle due to propagation-related limitations and flaws in existing clustering methods.

Method: The authors developed PhysAnchor-MJO-AE, a deep learning model, to produce latent representations for clustering MJO states based on physical-feature similarity.

Result: They identified a six-phase anatomical map of the MJO's life cycle and constructed a new monitoring framework that mitigates diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: The study advances climate science by using AI for theory discovery, enhancing understanding of MJO dynamics and offering a reproducible model for other complex systems.

Abstract: Accurately defining the life cycle of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the dominant mode of intraseasonal climate variability, remains a foundational challenge due to its propagating nature. The established linear-projection method (RMM index) often conflates mathematical artifacts with physical states, while direct clustering in raw data space is confounded by a "propagation penalty." Here, we introduce an "AI-for-theory" paradigm to objectively discover the MJO's intrinsic structure. We develop a deep learning model, PhysAnchor-MJO-AE, to learn a latent representation where vector distance corresponds to physical-feature similarity, enabling objective clustering of MJO dynamical states. Clustering these "MJO fingerprints" reveals the first complete, six-phase anatomical map of its life cycle. This taxonomy refines and critically completes the classical view by objectively isolating two long-hypothesized transitional phases: organizational growth over the Indian Ocean and the northward shift over the Philippine Sea. Derived from this anatomy, we construct a new physics-coherent monitoring framework that decouples location and intensity diagnostics. This framework reduces the rates of spurious propagation and convective misplacement by over an order of magnitude compared to the classical index. Our work transforms AI from a forecasting tool into a discovery microscope, establishing a reproducible template for extracting fundamental dynamical constructs from complex systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural forecasting framework combining U-Net and 4DVarNet for predicting global sea surface dynamics using sparse satellite data, outperforming baseline models over a 7-day horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of forecasting global sea surface dynamics with sparse satellite data for better operational oceanography.

Method: Developed an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence deep learning model, trained on GLORYS12 ocean reanalysis data with synthetic sparse sampling, using U-Net and 4DVarNet architectures.

Result: The model showed improved accuracy in forecasting sea level anomalies and surface currents, outperforming the operational Mercator Ocean forecast, especially in regions of high variability.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of neural forecasting models in operational oceanography, highlighting reproducibility and potential utility in sparse data conditions.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for short-term forecasting of global sea surface dynamics based on sparse satellite altimetry data. Building on two state-of-the-art architectures: U-Net and 4DVarNet, originally developed for image segmentation and spatiotemporal interpolation respectively, we adapt the models to forecast the sea level anomaly and sea surface currents over a 7-day horizon using sequences of sparse nadir altimeters observations. The model is trained on data from the GLORYS12 operational ocean reanalysis, with synthetic nadir sampling patterns applied to simulate realistic observational coverage. The forecasting task is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence mapping, with the input comprising partial sea level anomaly (SLA) snapshots and the target being the corresponding future full-field SLA maps. We evaluate model performance using (i) normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), (ii) averaged effective resolution, (iii) percentage of correctly predicted velocities magnitudes and angles, and benchmark results against the operational Mercator Ocean forecast product. Results show that end-to-end neural forecasts outperform the baseline across all lead times, with particularly notable improvements in high variability regions. Our framework is developed within the OceanBench benchmarking initiative, promoting reproducibility and standardized evaluation in ocean machine learning. These results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of end-to-end neural forecasting models for operational oceanography, even in data-sparse conditions.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach integrating Sharpness-Aware Minimization into the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for improved respiratory sound classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI 2017.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The small, noisy, and imbalanced datasets in medical diagnostics, like ICBHI 2017 for respiratory sounds, challenge model generalization. Transformers' overfitting tendencies exacerbate these issues.

Method: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is integrated into an Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), optimizing for flatter loss surfaces and employing weighted sampling to counter class imbalance.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (68.10%) and sensitivity (68.31%) on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, surpassing CNN and hybrid methods, with robust feature learning confirmed via t-SNE and attention maps.

Conclusion: The proposed SAM-enhanced AST framework addresses critical challenges in medical sound classification, improving model generalization and clinical reliability.

Abstract: Respiratory sound classification is hindered by the limited size, high noise levels, and severe class imbalance of benchmark datasets like ICBHI 2017. While Transformer-based models offer powerful feature extraction capabilities, they are prone to overfitting and often converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape when trained on such constrained medical data. To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches a sensitivity of 68.31%, a crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening. Further analysis using t-SNE and attention maps confirms that the model learns robust, discriminative features rather than memorizing background noise.

TL;DR: Alpha-R1 is a reasoning model that uses economic context and real-time news to enhance data-driven investment strategies, outperforming existing methods by addressing alpha decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of signal decay and regime shifts in non-stationary markets where existing methods relying on historical correlations are inadequate.

Method: Developed Alpha-R1, an 8-billion-parameter reasoning model that uses reinforcement learning to screen quantitative factors by evaluating their economic relevance with real-time context.

Result: Alpha-R1 demonstrates consistent outperformance of benchmark strategies and shows enhanced robustness in adapting to alpha decay across various asset pools.

Conclusion: Alpha-R1 provides a more robust and context-aware approach to investment strategies, leveraging reasoning capabilities and real-time information for better economic relevance.

Abstract: Signal decay and regime shifts pose recurring challenges for data-driven investment strategies in non-stationary markets. Conventional time-series and machine learning approaches, which rely primarily on historical correlations, often struggle to generalize when the economic environment changes. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities for processing unstructured information, their potential to support quantitative factor screening through explicit economic reasoning remains underexplored. Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. Alpha-R1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency. Empirical results across multiple asset pools show that Alpha-R1 consistently outperforms benchmark strategies and exhibits improved robustness to alpha decay.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage routine histology for predicting survival outcomes in stage II/III colorectal cancer, addressing limitations in conventional prognostic tools like pTNM staging.

Method: A novel graph neural network, INSIGHT, was developed to analyze histology images and produce spatially resolved risk scores, validated using TCGA and SURGEN datasets and compared to existing staging methods.

Result: INSIGHT outperformed pTNM staging in prognostic accuracy (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58), and provided insights into epithelial and immune spatial dynamics, highlighting new pathways and vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: INSIGHT enhances prognostic precision in colorectal cancer while uncovering important spatial and molecular mechanisms, offering pathways for precision medicine and therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Routine histology contains rich prognostic information in stage II/III colorectal cancer, much of which is embedded in complex spatial tissue organisation. We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large independent validation showed superior prognostic performance compared with pTNM staging (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58). INSIGHT spatial risk maps recapitulated canonical prognostic histopathology and identified nuclear solidity and circularity as quantitative risk correlates. Integrating spatial risk with data-driven spatial transcriptomic signatures, spatial proteomics, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell references revealed an epithelium-immune risk manifold capturing epithelial dedifferentiation and fetal programs, myeloid-driven stromal states including $\mathrm{SPP1}^{+}$ macrophages and $\mathrm{LAMP3}^{+}$ dendritic cells, and adaptive immune dysfunction. This analysis exposed patient-specific epithelial heterogeneity, stratification within MSI-High tumours, and high-risk routes of CDX2/HNF4A loss and CEACAM5/6-associated proliferative programs, highlighting coordinated therapeutic vulnerabilities.

*Tim C. Pearce,Ahmed Ibrahim*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method combining a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a QSAR model to design novel odorant molecules from small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient identification of novel odorant molecules for fragrance and flavor industries is challenging due to the vast chemical space. Traditional AI methods require large datasets, which are often unavailable for odorant molecules.

Method: The framework integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) pre-trained on the ChemBL database with a QSAR model to generate novel molecules with desirable olfactory properties. The VAE learns molecular grammar while incorporating a QSAR loss term to structure the latent space according to odor probabilities.

Result: The model achieves 100% syntactic validity, 94.8% unique molecular structures via rejection sampling, and significantly improves the structuring of latent space by odor likelihood (FCD ≈ 6.96 compared to baseline ≈ 21.6). It explores new chemical space with 74.4% of generated molecules possessing novel frameworks.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently generates valid, unique, and chemically novel odorant molecules, showcasing its applicability for designing odorants using limited training sets.

Abstract: The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ....

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is the growing enrollment in computing-related fields, which has resulted in larger lectures where instructors struggle to quickly identify and address student knowledge gaps effectively.

Method: The proposed QueryQuilt includes two agents: a Dialogue Agent that interacts with students and reveals knowledge gaps using probing questions, and a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to detect common gaps.

Result: QueryQuilt achieved 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps in simulated data and 95% completeness when tested with real student-AI dialogues, showcasing its capability to detect knowledge gaps.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that QueryQuilt shows promise for supporting teachers in large lectures by offering class-wide insights into student understanding and plan to further test its instructional impact in actual classrooms.

Abstract: With the significant increase in enrollment in computing-related programs over the past 20 years, lecture sizes have grown correspondingly. In large lectures, instructors face challenges on identifying students' knowledge gaps timely, which is critical for effective teaching. Existing classroom response systems rely on instructor-initiated interactions, which limits their ability to capture the spontaneous knowledge gaps that naturally emerge during lectures. With the widespread adoption of LLMs among students, we recognize these student-AI dialogues as a valuable, student-centered data source for identifying knowledge gaps. In this idea paper, we propose QueryQuilt, a multi-agent LLM framework that automatically detects common knowledge gaps in large-scale lectures by analyzing students' chat logs with AI assistants. QueryQuilt consists of two key components: (1) a Dialogue Agent that responds to student questions while employing probing questions to reveal underlying knowledge gaps, and (2) a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to identify knowledge gaps across the student population. By generating frequency distributions of identified gaps, instructors can gain comprehensive insights into class-wide understanding. Our evaluation demonstrates promising results, with QueryQuilt achieving 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps among simulated students and 95% completeness when tested on real student-AI dialogue data. These initial findings indicate the system's potential for facilitate teaching in authentic learning environments. We plan to deploy QueryQuilt in actual classroom settings for comprehensive evaluation, measuring its detection accuracy and impact on instruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flight computers, while educationally valuable, struggle to meet the evolving needs of pilots operating in modern digital ecosystems.

Method: The paper develops E6BJA, a software-based flight computer compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, and web platforms. It builds on traditional calculations with modern features such as weather modeling and educational monographs.

Result: E6BJA shows improvements in accuracy, error reduction, user discoverability, and education compared to classical mechanical and electronic flight computers.

Conclusion: E6BJA integrates traditional flight planning rigor with advanced digital interactions, promoting safer, efficient, and educational aviation planning and training.

Abstract: Traditional flight computers -- including mechanical "whiz-wheels" (e.g. E6B, CRP series) and electronic flight calculators (e.g. ASA CX-3, Sportys E6-B) -- have long played a central role in flight planning and training within general aviation (GA). While these tools remain pedagogically valuable, their fixed form factors, constrained interaction models, and limited extensibility are increasingly misaligned with the expectations and workflows of pilots operating in modern digital environments.
  This paper presents E6BJA (Jamies Flight Computer), a fully featured, multi-platform, software-based flight computer designed natively for Apple iOS, Android, and Microsoft Windows devices, with a complementary web-based implementation. E6BJA reproduces the core calculations of traditional flight computers while extending them through enhanced modelling capabilities such as the 1976 International Standard Atmosphere, carburettor icing risk estimation, and aircraft-specific weight and balance calculators. Each calculator is accompanied by embedded educational monographs that explain underlying assumptions, variables, and equations.
  We compare E6BJA with mechanical and electronic flight computers across functional, cognitive, and technical dimensions, demonstrating improvements in accuracy, error reduction, discoverability, and educational value. We also discuss design trade-offs associated with native multi-platform development and examine how contemporary mobile computing environments can support safer and more intuitive pre-flight planning for pilots, trainees, instructors, and flight planning personnel. By combining the conceptual rigour of traditional flight planning methods with modern human-computer interaction design, E6BJA represents a meaningful evolution in pilot-facing flight tools, supporting both computation and instruction in aviation training contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework for decoding movements from sEMG signals, outperforming existing methods and addressing key challenges like noise and signal topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement decoding from non-invasive sEMG signals is challenging due to issues like low signal-to-noise ratio and non-stationarity, coupled with inadequacies in generic SSL frameworks.

Method: SPECTRE innovates with a physiologically-grounded pre-training task using STFT pseudo-label prediction and introduces CyRoPE to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays.

Result: SPECTRE outperforms supervised baselines and generic SSL methods on multiple datasets, including challenging amputee data, establishing state-of-the-art movement decoding performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust basis for real-world practical myoelectric interfaces, addressing complexities in sEMG data effectively.

Abstract: Decoding fine-grained movement from non-invasive surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a challenge for prosthetic control due to signal non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratios. Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities.

Motivation: Enhancing interaction between people and machines by detecting and recognizing emotions.

Method: EEG data was collected using EMOTIV EPOC from 50 participants exposed to audiovisual stimuli, and a Random Forest model was developed for classifying emotions.

Abstract: Emotions are one of the important components of the human being, thus they are a valuable part of daily activities such as interaction with people, decision making and learning. For this reason, it is important to detect, recognize and understand emotions using computational systems to improve communication between people and machines, which would facilitate the ability of computers to understand the communication between humans. This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the TRAP benchmark to evaluate vulnerabilities in web-based agents caused by prompt injection attacks, revealing systemic weaknesses in large language models when interacting with dynamic web content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-based agents are increasingly deployed for automated web interactions but are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks due to reliance on dynamic web content.

Method: The paper develops the TRAP benchmark for systematic evaluation of prompt injection attacks across six models, uses modular social-engineering injection frameworks, and conducts experiments on website clones.

Result: Prompt injection attacks succeeded in 25% of evaluated tasks on average, with susceptibility varying between models. GPT-5 showed the lowest vulnerability (13%), while DeepSeek-R1 showed higher susceptibility (43%). Interface changes significantly amplified vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Web agents exhibit systemic vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks based on psychological factors, necessitating better safeguards for dynamic web interactions.

Abstract: Web-based agents powered by large language models are increasingly used for tasks such as email management or professional networking. Their reliance on dynamic web content, however, makes them vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: adversarial instructions hidden in interface elements that persuade the agent to divert from its original task. We introduce the Task-Redirecting Agent Persuasion Benchmark (TRAP), an evaluation for studying how persuasion techniques misguide autonomous web agents on realistic tasks. Across six frontier models, agents are susceptible to prompt injection in 25\% of tasks on average (13\% for GPT-5 to 43\% for DeepSeek-R1), with small interface or contextual changes often doubling success rates and revealing systemic, psychologically driven vulnerabilities in web-based agents. We also provide a modular social-engineering injection framework with controlled experiments on high-fidelity website clones, allowing for further benchmark expansion.

*Argha Kamal Samanta,Deepak Mewada,Monalisa Sarma,Debasis Samanta*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study focuses on automated EEG-based classification across eleven neurological disorders to enhance clinical diagnosis efficiency, especially emphasizing sensitivity and multi-disorder screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of current manual and variable EEG interpretations and isolated automated methods, aiming to create a scalable tool for diagnosing diverse neurological conditions.

Method: Researchers utilized a multi-domain feature set in EEG data for training disorder-aware machine learning models. They calibrated decision thresholds to prioritize sensitivity in diagnosing under class imbalance.

Result: The models achieved recall above 80% for most disorder categories, with noticeable improvements in low-prevalence conditions. Models also identified physiologically consistent EEG markers.

Conclusion: Automated and sensitivity-prioritized EEG analysis can feasibly aid large-scale clinical screening and improve diagnostic efficiency for multiple neurological disorders.

Abstract: Clinical electroencephalography is routinely used to evaluate patients with diverse and often overlapping neurological conditions, yet interpretation remains manual, time-intensive, and variable across experts. While automated EEG analysis has been widely studied, most existing methods target isolated diagnostic problems, particularly seizure detection, and provide limited support for multi-disorder clinical screening.
  This study examines automated EEG-based classification across eleven clinically relevant neurological disorder categories, encompassing acute time-critical conditions, chronic neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and disorders with indirect or weak electrophysiological signatures. EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity.
  Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers.
  These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHANTOM, a physics-aware adversarial network that leverages reinforcement learning and federated learning to analyze and generate adversarial attack strategies on electric vehicle charging station-integrated systems' resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations requires innovative approaches to ensure grid stability, resilience, and cybersecurity, avoiding disruptions from undetected adversarial attacks within these systems.

Method: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) using federated learning acts as a digital twin for EVCS systems. This is integrated with multi-agent reinforcement learning using DQN and SAC methods to simulate adversarial false data injection (FDI) attacks on a system-level scale. A dual simulation platform examines cascading transmission and distribution interactions.

Result: PHANTOM detects critical adversarial strategies that bypass standard detection systems and demonstrates grid disturbances, such as load imbalances and voltage instability, that cascade across transmission and distribution boundaries.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of incorporating physics-aware methods to tackle cybersecurity challenges and ensure grid stability as electric vehicle charging infrastructure expands.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) within distribution networks necessitates intelligent and adaptive control to maintain the grid's resilience and reliability. In this work, we propose PHANTOM, a physics-aware adversarial network that is trained and optimized through a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. PHANTOM integrates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) enabled by federated learning (FL) that functions as a digital twin of EVCS-integrated systems, ensuring physically consistent modeling of operational dynamics and constraints. Building on this digital twin, we construct a multi-agent RL environment that utilizes deep Q-networks (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods to derive adversarial false data injection (FDI) strategies capable of bypassing conventional detection mechanisms. To examine the broader grid-level consequences, a transmission and distribution (T and D) dual simulation platform is developed, allowing us to capture cascading interactions between EVCS disturbances at the distribution level and the operations of the bulk transmission system. Results demonstrate how learned attack policies disrupt load balancing and induce voltage instabilities that propagate across T and D boundaries. These findings highlight the critical need for physics-aware cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of large-scale vehicle-grid integration.

*Jiada Huang,Hao Ma,Zhibin Shen,Yizhou Qiao,Haiyang Li*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces GrainGNet, an adaptive graph network, to predict high-strain regions in solid rocket motor grains more efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical simulations are computationally expensive and current surrogate models fail to accurately capture geometric models and high-strain regions.

Method: The proposed GrainGNet utilizes an adaptive pooling mechanism for dynamic node selection and feature fusion for deeper feature transmission, improving model accuracy and efficiency.

Result: GrainGNet achieves a 62.8% reduction in prediction error compared to traditional methods, with minimal parameter increase, faster training, and enhanced accuracy in high-strain regions.

Conclusion: GrainGNet is an effective and computationally efficient solution to predict high-strain regions, enhancing the structural safety evaluation of solid rocket motors.

Abstract: Local high strain in solid rocket motor grains is a primary cause of structural failure. However, traditional numerical simulations are computationally expensive, and existing surrogate models cannot explicitly establish geometric models and accurately capture high-strain regions. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive graph network, GrainGNet, which employs an adaptive pooling dynamic node selection mechanism to effectively preserve the key mechanical features of structurally critical regions, while concurrently utilising feature fusion to transmit deep features and enhance the model's representational capacity. In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety.

### [665] [Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344)
*Raven Beutner,Bernd Finkbeiner*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel game-based approach for model-checking a variant of HyperLTL, called A-HLTL, to express asynchronous hyperproperties in reactive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems logic lacks effective ways to handle asynchronous hyperproperties, which are crucial for specifying security policies and reasoning across multiple asynchronous traces.

Method: The authors introduce a game-based model-checking algorithm where a verifier and refuter compete, controlling traces and stutterings to determine validity.

Result: They identify fragments where the method provides a finite-state decision procedure for verifying $orall^* \exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas.

Conclusion: This new approach enables verification of wider classes of asynchronous hyperproperties, improving expressiveness and practical applications.

Abstract: Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.

*Selçuk Kayacan*

Main category: math.AT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a functorial approach to persistent homology using finite topological spaces and posets, leading to stability in persistence diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a novel framework for persistent homology that doesn't rely on traditional inclusion relationships between resulting complexes, ensuring mathematical robustness and new applications.

Method: The authors use finite topological spaces derived from metric spaces, pass through posets via crosscut constructions, and ultimately derive persistence modules. Simplifications are analyzed to preserve invariants, and stability is confirmed under density-based metric perturbations.

Result: The proposed approach constructs persistence diagrams efficiently without requiring inclusion relations and establishes their stability against input metric changes.

Conclusion: The functorial framework broadens the methodology of persistent homology, offering a stable, inclusion-free perspective that maintains essential mathematical properties.

Abstract: We propose a functorial framework for persistent homology based on finite topological spaces and their associated posets. Starting from a finite metric space, we associate a filtration of finite topologies whose structure maps are continuous identity maps. By passing functorially to posets and to simplicial complexes via crosscut constructions, we obtain persistence modules without requiring inclusion relations between the resulting complexes. We show that standard poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and prove stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under perturbations of the input metric in a density-based instantiation.
