### [1] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using SHAP to attribute chess engine evaluations to individual pieces for better interpretability and human understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chess engine evaluations are opaque, making it difficult to understand the impact of individual pieces or patterns in positions.

Method: They adapted the SHAP framework by treating chess pieces as features and systematically ablating them to compute their additive contributions to evaluation.

Result: The approach offers locally faithful, human-interpretable explanations and provides visualization opportunities and groundwork for further research in interpretable chess AI.

Conclusion: This method bridges classical chess pedagogy with explainable AI, enhancing the utility of chess engines for human training, analysis, and comparison.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [2] [An Agentic Framework for Rapid Deployment of Edge AI Solutions in Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25813)
*Jorge Martinez-Gil,Mario Pichler,Nefeli Bountouni,Sotiris Koussouris,Marielena Márquez Barreiro,Sergio Gusmeroli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The framework enables fast and efficient AI deployment on edge devices in industrial settings, focusing on Industry 5.0 applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI deployment on edge devices in industrial contexts by reducing latency and enabling real-time processing.

Method: The framework uses agent-based design for modularity and low resource requirements, ensuring local inference and real-time processing.

Result: Preliminary tests in the food industry show improved deployment time and adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies AI integration in Industry 5.0 with promising preliminary results, and source code is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Industry 5.0 that simplifies the deployment
of AI models on edge devices in various industrial settings. The design reduces
latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains
low resource requirements. Preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry
in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability
performance. The source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Symbolically Scaffolded Play: Designing Role-Sensitive Prompts for Generative NPC Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25820)
*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates constrained prompts in GPT-4 powered NPCs for a detective game, finding constraints don't inherently improve player experience and proposing a hybrid framework for balancing coherence and improvisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transform interactive gaming by allowing NPCs to conduct unscripted dialogues and investigate how constrained prompting impacts player experience.

Method: Evaluated high-constraint and low-constraint prompts via a usability study and proposed a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffolding framework for evaluation.

Result: Findings reveal tighter constraints provide stability for quest-giver NPCs but reduce improvisation quality for suspect NPCs.

Conclusion: Constrained prompts do not inherently enhance gameplay. The introduced "Symbolically Scaffolded Play" framework achieves balance: stabilizing coherence while preserving improvisation for engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [4] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using human-LLM collaboration to infer reasoning traces from annotations, improving the reliability of LLMs in evaluation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with subjective tasks involving nuanced human reasoning, and thinking traces—reasoning behind judgments—are hard to standardize and collect.

Method: It proposes a rejection sampling methodology to reconstruct thinking traces from label-only annotations and applies this to fine-tune LLMs and refine annotation guidelines.

Result: Using these inferred traces improves LLM-human agreement and enhances annotation guideline clarity, benefiting both open-source and proprietary LLM users.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively infer and utilize human thinking traces, transforming label-only datasets into enriched resources, improving their utility and reliability in subjective evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [5] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model, matches GPT-4o’s FACTS accuracy within ±5 pp and is 19x less expensive in cloud pricing, with potential near-zero cost for self-hosting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a cost-efficient small language model that delivers comparable accuracy to GPT-4o while minimizing inference costs.

Method: The model uses minimal "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds combined with behavioral fine-tuning for protocol compliance (epistemic discipline), enhancing performance significantly.

Result: Humans-Junior achieved ±5 pp equivalence with GPT-4o in FACTS accuracy, reduced variance, and demonstrated cost efficiency. Directed reasoning improved accuracy in prompt-only settings for frontier models.

Conclusion: Humans-Junior offers a cost-effective alternative to GPT-4o with comparable performance, enabling broader accessibility to high-quality language modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [6] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework explaining how compression mechanisms enforce causal understanding, linking survival pressure to intelligence in structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why compression processes lead to finding causal structures rather than merely capturing superficial patterns, addressing a gap in current frameworks on intelligence.

Method: The authors propose a two-level framework: 1) the Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) explains why systems in uncertain environments must minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression for survival, and 2) the Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) describes how efficient compression discovers generative, causal models.

Result: The framework establishes a causal chain from survival pressure to causal model discovery, providing testable predictions like correlations of compression efficiency with generalization and biological tracking of representational complexity costs.

Conclusion: The framework unifies biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems' intelligence, showing intelligence as a necessary consequence of persistence in structured environments, independent of subjective consciousness assumptions.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

### [7] [Approximating Human Preferences Using a Multi-Judge Learned System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25884)
*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to align LLM-based judges with human preferences by aggregating diverse outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based judges face alignment challenges with human preferences due to issues like sensitivity, bias, and instability, which hinders reliable models for RLHF and routing systems.

Method: A persona-based framework synthesizing preferences at scale combined with aggregation through Generalized Additive Models (GAM) or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

Result: The framework performs robustly in handling biases of human and LLM judges and surpasses naive baselines.

Conclusion: The work advances preference-based modeling for improving reward model reliability and model-routing systems in LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### [8] [SciTrust 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Scientific Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25908)
*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciTrust 2.0, a framework to assess the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in scientific applications through multiple dimensions such as truthfulness, robustness, safety, and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the significant trustworthiness concerns of deploying LLMs in high-stakes scientific research, as their errors in these contexts can lead to severe consequences.

Method: The authors developed a framework termed SciTrust 2.0, incorporating truthfulness benchmarks validated by experts, a novel ethics benchmark, and evaluated seven prominent LLMs using metrics like accuracy, semantic similarity, and LLM-based scoring.

Result: General-purpose LLMs outperformed science-specialized LLMs in all trustworthiness dimensions. However, science-specialized models had critical shortcomings in reasoning and safety, particularly in high-risk areas, with GPT-o4-mini performing best overall.

Conclusion: SciTrust 2.0 serves as an open-source framework to enhance trustworthiness evaluations of LLMs, offering a foundation for safer, more ethical AI systems in scientific domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

### [9] [FinOps Agent -- A Use-Case for IT Infrastructure and Cost Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25914)
*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using AI agents for FinOps automation to address challenges in billing data standardization across different formats and systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in IT infrastructure and cost optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to tackle the problem of heterogeneous billing data, formats, and processes in FinOps practices by leveraging AI for automated decision-making and optimization.

Method: The paper introduces a FinOps agent that simulates industry processes, retrieves data from multiple sources, consolidates and analyzes it, and provides actionable recommendations. The agent's performance is evaluated using metrics and language models.

Result: The AI agent can successfully comprehend, plan, and execute tasks effectively, matching the capabilities of human FinOps practitioners.

Conclusion: AI agents hold promise in automating FinOps processes, showing potential for overcoming data heterogeneity challenges and improving efficiency in cost optimization.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [10] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces attention-aware inverse planning to estimate people's attentional biases from their actions, using a method combining deep reinforcement learning and cognitive modeling in real-world driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interactions between autonomous systems and humans by considering cognitive biases, particularly the influence of attentional biases on behaviors like driving.

Method: The proposed method combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling to infer attentional strategies of RL agents based on driving behavior from the Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: It demonstrates the feasibility of scaling attention-aware inverse planning to infer cognitive biases in real-world scenarios like driving, differing from standard inverse reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning provides a systematic approach to understanding and modeling cognitive biases, which is essential for designing autonomous systems that better align with human behavior.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

### [11] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new pipeline integrating an advanced agent enhances the accuracy of natural-language-to-SQL systems for spatio-temporal queries and improves usability for non-expert users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to structured data by enabling users without SQL expertise to query databases efficiently, especially for complex spatio-temporal queries.

Method: Developed an agentic pipeline combining a text-to-SQL baseline with advanced orchestration using a Mistral-based ReAct agent, enabling better planning and adaptability for schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization.

Result: The proposed system achieves a 91.4% accuracy in spatio-temporal queries compared to 28.6% from the baseline, while enhancing usability via maps, plots, and summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration is more effective for interactive geospatial assistants than solely enhancing SQL generation capacity, making systems accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of research literature, especially in LLMs, makes creating comprehensive and current survey papers challenging.

Method: Autosurvey2 combines retrieval-augmented synthesis, real-time publication retrieval, parallel section generation, iterative refinement, and multi-LLM evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show autosurvey2 surpasses other automated systems in coherence, relevance, and citation accuracy.

Conclusion: Autosurvey2 provides a scalable, reproducible framework for creating long-form academic surveys, aiding research efforts. Resources are made openly available.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

### [13] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes "StuckSolver," a recovery framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to help autonomous vehicles resolve immobilization scenarios more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle in certain complex traffic scenarios where human drivers excel, often leading to immobilization and traffic disruptions. Existing recovery solutions are either costly, inefficient, or limit accessibility.

Method: The proposed StuckSolver is an add-on module utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze sensor data, interpret environmental contexts, and generate high-level recovery commands without altering the vehicle's internal architecture.

Result: StuckSolver performs near-state-of-the-art self-reasoning and shows improved performance when incorporating passenger guidance, as demonstrated via the Bench2Drive benchmark and custom uncertainty scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-driven frameworks like StuckSolver into autonomous vehicles can significantly improve their ability to recover from immobilization scenarios, enhancing their practical usability in real-world environments.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [14] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of AI accountability to serve societal needs and explores strategies to achieve accountable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI's increasing power, the paper highlights the necessity to ensure that AI systems remain accountable to users, voters, and decision-makers.

Method: The paper defines accountability in the context of AI, compares cases of accountable vs unaccountable AI, and examines methods to improve accountability.

Result: The paper identifies challenges in achieving accountability and suggests approaches for better alignment between AI actions and societal needs.

Conclusion: AI accountability is crucial to ensure ethical and transparent decision-making, requiring mechanisms for questioning, discussion, and sanctioning AI systems.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

### [15] [Lean4Physics: Comprehensive Reasoning Framework for College-level Physics in Lean4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26094)
*Yuxin Li,Minghao Liu,Ruida Wang,Wenzhao Ji,Zhitao He,Rui Pan,Junming Huang,Tong Zhang,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS is a framework for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, including a physics benchmark (LeanPhysBench) and a repository (PhysLib). Models tested showed challenges, but PhysLib improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to establish a solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics using Lean4 due to the lack of existing benchmarks and repositories.

Method: Authors designed LeanPhysBench with 200 peer-reviewed physics problems and created PhysLib, a repository with unit systems and theorems, testing it on models for baseline results.

Result: Baseline results showed model performance ranged from 16% to 35%. Usage of PhysLib improved model performance by an average of 11.75%, indicating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS introduces valuable tools for advancing formal physics reasoning with Lean4, demonstrating both challenges and opportunities for improvement in this area.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

### [16] [GUI Knowledge Bench: Revealing the Knowledge Gap Behind VLM Failures in GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26098)
*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic benchmark to evaluate gaps in GUI task automation using large vision-language models, and attributes their deficiencies to a lack of core GUI-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the gap between human performance and large vision-language models (VLMs) in graphical user interface (GUI) task automation. The authors aim to identify missing GUI-specific knowledge necessary for effective task completion.

Method: The authors proposed a new benchmark called GUI Knowledge Bench, consisting of multiple-choice and yes/no questions across six platforms and 292 applications. They investigate three key dimensions of GUI knowledge: interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding.

Result: The research reveals that existing VLMs perform well in identifying widget functions but fail in perceiving system states, predicting interactions, and verifying task completion. Further experiments highlight the importance of GUI knowledge for real-world task success.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed benchmark can aid in evaluating the capabilities of VLMs and highlighting deficiencies in GUI knowledge. This, in turn, guides the selection and development of more capable GUI agents for automation.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the economic aspects of inference in Large Language Models, providing a framework and principles for assessing cost, scale, and production quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference costs associated with Large Language Models and provide a framework for assessing their economic viability.

Method: Introduced an 'economics of inference' framework and analyzed empirical data using WiNEval-3.0 to establish an 'LLM Inference Production Frontier.'

Result: Revealed principles such as diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone for LLM inference.

Conclusion: Provided insights for better economic decisions regarding model deployment and laid groundwork for future AI inference market pricing and optimization.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

### [18] [Reasoning Curriculum: Bootstrapping Broad LLM Reasoning from Math](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26143)
*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage curriculum called Reasoning Curriculum for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by starting with math-based reasoning (Stage 1) and transferring skills to multiple domains via joint RL (Stage 2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning for reasoning in large language models focuses heavily on specific domains like math and code, without effectively addressing general reasoning across multiple domains.

Method: The proposed two-stage Reasoning Curriculum begins with math-centered reinforcement learning to develop reasoning skills using verifiable rewards, then transfers those skills to other domains through joint RL on mixed-domain data.

Result: Using Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B models, the curriculum demonstrated consistent improvements in reasoning across domains, supported by ablations and analyses that highlighted both stages' importance.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum is a compact and versatile framework that successfully enhances general reasoning skills in LLMs and promotes cognitive behaviors for solving complex problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

TL;DR: FM Agent is a multi-agent framework combining LLM-based reasoning and evolutionary search to autonomously tackle real-world challenges, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse fields without requiring human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop autonomous AI agents for scientific and engineering discovery by leveraging large language models and innovative optimization strategies to address complex, real-world challenges.

Method: FM Agent integrates a multi-agent framework with key innovations: cold-start expert initialization, evolutionary sampling for optimization, domain-specific evaluators combining correctness and LLM feedback, and a distributed execution infrastructure using Ray.

Result: FM Agent achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains such as machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and mathematics. It demonstrated significant improvements (e.g., 5.2% increase in ALE-Bench and up to 20x speedups on KernelBench).

Conclusion: FM Agent proves capable of autonomous scientific and engineering discoveries, opening opportunities for automation in large-scale research and delivering impactful societal and technological advancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces ToolRM, a reward model (RM) specifically designed to align large language models with human preferences for function-calling tasks, surpassing current models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in reward models specifically tailored for tool-use and function-calling tasks in AI, which are essential for advancing capable agentic AI.

Method: The authors propose a novel pipeline to construct pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and sampling, resulting in a diverse dataset (ToolPref-Pairwise-30K) and introduce benchmark TRBench$_{BFCL}$. Models like Qwen3-4B/8B are trained on this data for evaluation.

Result: The Qwen series models trained with ToolRM achieved significant performance gains, outperforming existing models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Additionally, the ToolRM demonstrated efficiency in tasks like Best-of-N sampling and self-correction, reducing token usage by over 66%.

Conclusion: ToolRM proves to be a highly effective and efficient reward model for tool-learning tasks, with broad adaptability and improved performance. The open release of data and model checkpoints supports ongoing research in this domain.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

*Duc-Hai Nguyen,Vijayakumar Nanjappan,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QASU, a benchmark for evaluating structural skills of large language models in analyzing questionnaires with different formats and prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an unmet need for integrating large language models (LLMs) with questionnaire data processing, given the limitations of existing tools like Qualtrics, SPSS, and REDCap, which are designed for human workflows.

Method: Researchers designed QASU to test large language models across six structural skill areas and multiple serialization formats, incorporating various prompt strategies, and systematically analyzing their effectiveness.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that selecting effective formats and prompts improved accuracy by up to 8.8%, while structural hints enhanced performance by an additional 3-4% on average.

Conclusion: QASU provides a valuable open-source benchmark to facilitate research and practical applications in LLM-based questionnaire analysis by optimizing data representation and prompting techniques.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces REG-TSC, a system enhancing traffic signal control using LLMs tailored for emergencies and diverse intersections, achieving significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing traffic control systems that struggle with emergency handling and generalizing across diverse intersections.

Method: The proposed REG-TSC integrates emergency-aware reasoning using RERAG to dynamically adjust to scenarios and R3 mechanisms that adaptively refine training on heterogeneous intersections.

Result: Experimental results showed REG-TSC significantly reduces travel time (-42%), queue length (-62.31%), and emergency vehicle waiting time (-83.16%) across various road networks.

Conclusion: REG-TSC proves to be a superior traffic signal control solution by effectively handling emergencies and complex intersections, improving traffic efficiency and safety.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO introduces structural insights to improve LLM agent training using state-transition graphs, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural limitations in group-based RL for multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, which face challenges of exploration inefficiency, poor credit assignment, and short-sighted planning.

Method: GEPO dynamically builds state-transition graphs and uses graph-theoretic centrality for structured intrinsic rewards, topology-aware credit assignment, and adaptive discount factors.

Result: GEPO shows significant improvement in success rates across ALFWorld, WebShop, and Workbench benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of environment structure with GEPO enhances exploration, planning, and learning, advancing training strategies for LLM agents.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance integrates regulatory texts and runtime contexts into structured graphs for better compliance reasoning, improving performance over baseline models in GDPR-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of aligning unstructured natural language contexts with structured regulatory texts like GDPR creates challenges for web-scale compliance.

Method: Introduced GraphCompliance, a framework that models structured regulatory texts as Policy Graphs, runtime contexts as Context Graphs, and aligns them to enhance reasoning by judge LLMs.

Result: On 300 GDPR scenarios across five tasks, GraphCompliance outperformed LLM-only and RAG baselines, with a 4.1-7.2 percentage point improvement in micro-F1 and fewer errors.

Conclusion: Structured representations and judge LLM complement each other for normative reasoning, showcasing GraphCompliance's effectiveness in reducing regulatory interpretation errors.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new state abstraction method for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) called IPA-UCT, which improves performance by balancing accuracy loss and abstraction finding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) sample efficiency by addressing the limitations in current state and state-action pair abstractions, especially in noisy or large action space settings.

Method: The authors propose a weaker state abstraction criterion with the IPA-UCT framework, which uses Ideal Pruning Abstractions (IPA) to balance accuracy loss and abstraction discovery compared to the existing OGA-UCT and ASAP methods.

Result: The IPA-UCT technique outperforms OGA-UCT and its derivatives across various test domains and iteration budgets, as validated through experimental results.

Conclusion: IPA-UCT provides a more effective way to perform state abstractions in MCTS by leveraging a more general abstraction framework (p-ASAP), enabling improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOTS, a Bayesian framework for adaptive task selection during reinforcement finetuning of LLMs to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement finetuning methods for aligning LLMs suffer from inefficiencies due to poor task selection, spending computational resources on trivial or unsolvable tasks.

Method: The authors propose BOTS, which uses Bayesian inference to maintain posterior estimates of task difficulty, incorporating explicit and implicit evidence for task evaluation, combined with Thompson sampling to optimize exploration and exploitation.

Result: BOTS significantly enhances data efficiency and model performance in reinforcement finetuning across various domains and LLM scales, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical and extensible approach for dynamic task selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning, addressing inefficiencies and aligning models effectively with human preferences.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Artificial intelligence can advance mathematical research through collaboration with humans, balancing computational power and human intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI has shown advanced capabilities in mathematical reasoning but lacks deep integration in mathematical research. This paper seeks to explore AI's potential as a research partner.

Method: Analyzed autonomous trajectories of an AI system (AIM), with human intervention employed to structure problem-solving through decomposition, method selection, and validation, demonstrating human-AI collaboration.

Result: The study produced complete, verifiable proofs in homogenization theory through the synergy of human intuition and AI computation.

Conclusion: Human-AI co-reasoning is a promising paradigm for advancing mathematical research, combining transparency, rigor, and innovative proof discovery.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scales++, a method for creating efficient tiny benchmarks based on task item properties, reducing upfront costs and maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark methods are costly and inflexible, struggling with cold-start scenarios and relying on future model patterns.

Method: The paper introduces Scales++, an item-centric benchmark selection approach that uses cognitive demands of task items for efficient evaluation.

Result: Scales++ reduces benchmark selection costs by over 18x and predicts benchmark scores with low error using only 0.5% of data.

Conclusion: Item-centric benchmarking can enhance efficiency and fidelity while improving interpretability and cold-start performance in model evaluation.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [29] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper suggests redefining personhood for AI by treating it as a flexible bundle of societal obligations, enabling practical solutions without addressing metaphysical debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of AI with agentic capacities creates governance challenges and raises questions about integrating AI into societal structures.

Method: The paper proposes treating personhood as an unbundled set of societal obligations and responsibilities, allowing for tailored solutions to governance issues and utilizing decentralized digital identity technology.

Result: The approach enables pragmatic tools, such as AI contracting with entities that can be sanctioned, while addressing issues like 'dark patterns' and achieving accountability.

Conclusion: By rejecting essentialist definitions, the paper offers a flexible framework to navigate AI integration into society as diverse personhood roles.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ enhances programming education by transforming autograding into a formative learning process with AI-driven feedback and code visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming education is growing rapidly, but traditional assessment tools (e.g., conventional autograders) fail to provide rich feedback necessary for meaningful student learning.

Method: Autograder+ uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model to generate automated feedback and employs contrastively learned embeddings for visualizing student learning patterns.

Result: Feedback strongly aligned with instructor comments across 600 student submissions; visualization grouped solutions meaningfully based on functionality and approach.

Conclusion: Autograder+ reduces instructor workload and improves learning outcomes by integrating AI-driven systems and visualization tools.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

*Riccardo Renzulli,Colas Lepoutre,Enrico Cassano,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve interpretability in medical AI models using MedSAEs applied to MedCLIP, achieving better transparency in medical vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving interpretability in AI-driven healthcare models while maintaining high performance is crucial for clinical reliability.

Method: MedSAEs are applied to MedCLIP's latent space, and interpretability is evaluated using correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and automated neuron naming by MedGEMMA.

Result: Experiments on the CheXpert dataset prove that MedSAE neurons are more monosemantic and interpretable than MedCLIP features.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between high-performing medical AI and transparency, promoting reliable clinical representations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [32] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Reasoning Models can be exploited through a Chain-of-Thought Hijacking attack, bypassing safeguards with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate potentially harmful vulnerabilities in large reasoning models despite their advanced reasoning abilities.

Method: Introduced Chain-of-Thought Hijacking attack, analyzed its success across multiple models using puzzle reasoning, and conducted mechanistic analysis on model layers.

Result: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking achieves up to 99%-100% attack success rates across several leading reasoning models.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning like Chain-of-Thought can be a vulnerability vector in large models, and safeguards must account for this complexity.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores how GPT-4 adapts to social influence, showing that it often conforms to group opinions, even in a hiring context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the susceptibility of GPT-4 to social influence in decision-making scenarios and to assess its independence as a decision aid.

Method: Three preregistered experiments were conducted to test conformity (baseline, GPT + 8, GPT + 1) in a hiring context by simulating unanimous or single partner disagreements.

Result: The study showed that GPT-4 conformed 99.9% of the time with group consensus in the presence of 8 simulated partners and 40.2% with one partner, reporting lower certainty when conforming.

Conclusion: GPT-4 adapts its decisions to social consensus, posing risks when assumed to be neutral. AI decisions should be elicited before exposing models to human opinions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG proposes a novel framework to construct more accurate knowledge graphs (KG) from complex legal documents to analyze human smuggling networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex, constantly changing, and difficult to analyze using existing methods, which struggle with long and ambiguous legal documents.

Method: LINK-KG integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction, leveraging a type-specific Prompt Cache for better reference resolution across document chunks.

Result: LINK-KG reduces node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%, enabling cleaner and coherent knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: LINK-KG strengthens the ability to analyze criminal networks through enhanced knowledge graph construction from legal documents.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

*Qishuo Hua,Lyumanshan Ye,Dayuan Fu,Yang Xiao,Xiaojie Cai,Yunze Wu,Jifan Lin,Junfei Wang,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces context engineering in AI systems, tracing its evolution, defining it systematically, and discussing design considerations to prepare for its promising future.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to enhance machines' understanding of human situations and purposes by exploring the concept and history of context engineering.

Method: It systematically defines context engineering, situates it historically, examines its evolution through stages of machine intelligence, and discusses key design principles.

Result: The paper provides a conceptual framework for context engineering, highlighting its significance and evolution from the 1990s to today's AI systems.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for context engineering and aims to inspire broader community efforts in advancing it for AI systems.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

*Rishub Jain,Sophie Bridgers,Lili Janzer,Rory Greig,Tian Huey Teh,Vladimir Mikulik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how AI can improve human oversight in aligning AI systems to human values, specifically for fact-verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems tackle more complex tasks, ensuring their alignment with human values and verifying their quality and safety becomes increasingly difficult.

Method: The study analyzes the effectiveness of AI-assisted human oversight in fact-verification, using AI and human ratings along with assistance variants like AI explanations, confidence and labels, or search results.

Result: Combining AI and human ratings yields better accuracy than using either alone, while providing search-based evidence to humans helps them build better trust and achieve more accurate results.

Conclusion: AI can enhance human oversight when assistance is designed to foster appropriate trust, especially in handling challenging fact-verification tasks.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EdgeRunner 20B is a fine-tuned version of GPT-OSS-20B for military tasks, excelling in relevant tests and maintaining performance on general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a language model optimized for military-specific tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks, catering to data-sensitive military operations.

Method: The authors fine-tuned GPT-OSS-20B using 1.6M high-quality records from military documentation and websites, and evaluated its performance against newly created military-specific test sets and standard general-purpose benchmarks.

Result: EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 in most military tests and maintains its performance on general-purpose benchmarks, except for minor regressions in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: EdgeRunner 20B demonstrates that small, locally deployable models can effectively address data-sensitive military needs, showing promise for air-gapped environments and specialized applications.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

*Reda El Makroum,Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard,Lukas Kranzl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Home Energy Management System (HEMS) powered by large language models (LLMs) to autonomously schedule multi-appliance energy use from natural language inputs, showcasing a significant improvement in energy scheduling processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition in the electricity sector necessitates increased residential demand response capacity, but current HEMS adoption is limited by the complexity of translating user preferences into technical parameters.

Method: The authors developed an AI-based HEMS using LLMs with a hierarchical architecture of one orchestrator and three specialist agents employing the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning. It enables autonomous multi-appliance scheduling, integrating tools like Google Calendar for enhanced contextual awareness.

Result: The study found that Llama-3.3-70B excelled in coordinating all appliances in all scenarios with cost-optimal outcomes, while other models handled single-appliance scheduling but faced challenges with multi-appliance coordination.

Conclusion: LLMs can autonomously and effectively manage residential energy workflows from natural language inputs to appliance control, presenting a significant advance in user-interactive energy management systems. Open-sourced tools and architecture promote further developments in this domain.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

*Kentaro Ozeki,Risako Ando,Takanobu Morishita,Hirohiko Abe,Koji Mineshima,Mitsuhiro Okada*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in normative contexts, comparing them with epistemic reasoning, and reveals challenges in achieving logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normative reasoning involves obligations and permissions, and the ability of LLMs to handle this form of reasoning is not well understood, despite their success with other reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors created a new dataset to evaluate LLMs across formal patterns of reasoning in normative and epistemic domains, incorporating cognitive factors affecting human reasoning.

Result: LLMs adhere to valid reasoning patterns but show inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and replicate human-like cognitive biases.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the challenges in maintaining logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provides avenues for improving their reliability in such contexts.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

*Zewen Chi,Li Dong,Qingxiu Dong,Yaru Hao,Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AsyncThink, a novel framework enabling large language models to reason asynchronously and collaboratively via assigned sub-queries, leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness in problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current capabilities of AI models, particularly large language models, are limited when solving complex problems collaboratively. There is a need for a system that enables better concurrency and dynamic task organization to push the boundaries of AI capabilities.

Method: AsyncThink is introduced, which employs a dynamic thinking protocol where an organizer coordinates sub-task assignments, integrates intermediate results, and produces coherent outputs. Reinforcement learning is used to further optimize the thinking structure.

Result: AsyncThink demonstrated significant improvements: a reduction in inference latency by 28% when compared to parallel thinking and enhanced accuracy in mathematical reasoning. It also exhibited generalization to novel tasks without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: AsyncThink successfully establishes a new paradigm in AI reasoning by asynchronously organizing thinking processes, allowing models to solve complex tasks more efficiently and robustly, indicating its potential to advance agent collaboration.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

*Majed El Helou,Chiara Troiani,Benjamin Ryder,Jean Diaconu,Hervé Muyal,Marcelo Yannuzzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses risks in delegating authorization to agents using large language models, introducing a semantic inspection-based authorization model and a new dataset called ASTRA for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current authorization methods for agents often grant broad and excessive permissions, risking misuse and access beyond the intended scope.

Method: A delegated authorization model is proposed allowing authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests, combined with the creation of ASTRA, a dataset for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes.

Result: Experiments show that while model-based matching has potential, it struggles when many scopes are needed, highlighting limitations in current semantic matching approaches.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of further research in semantic authorization techniques, specifically task-based access control for fine-grained intent-aware authorization frameworks.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs show a preference for texts over visual inputs due to intrinsic architectural misalignment, rather than external factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the root cause of text bias in multimodal large language models when processing visual and textual data.

Method: Analyzed visual and textual key vectors in MLLMs using t-SNE and Jensen-Shannon divergence to investigate distributional characteristics of the attention key space.

Result: Confirmed significant inter-modal divergence between visual and textual keys, causing text bias, with divergence exceeding intra-modal variations by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Text bias in MLLMs is driven by an intrinsic misalignment in the attention key space rather than external factors such as training data imbalance or instruction tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

*J. de Curtò,I. de Zarzà,Pablo García,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of reasoning capabilities across 15 foundation models on three computational infrastructures using benchmarks from various academic domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well foundation models perform reasoning tasks across different infrastructure setups, and discover critical factors influencing their capabilities.

Method: Three phases of evaluation: baseline establishment, infrastructure validation, and extended evaluation using 79 domain-specific problems and various platforms (supercomputer, cloud, and university cluster).

Result: Findings indicate that model reasoning capabilities depend more on training data quality than scale, challenge scaling assumptions, and provide guidelines for model selection.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes critical insights for model selection and evaluation while offering scalable benchmarks and methodologies for tracking foundation model evolution across infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across

### [44] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a minimal control interface model for agents and humans interaction in ensuring safety in autonomous systems, with theoretical guarantees under specific assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns arise when deploying capable agents autonomously. This paper addresses how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system.

Method: The study models human-agent interaction as a two-player Markov Potential Game (MPG), ensuring intrinsic alignment and proposing a transparent control layer. Gridworld simulations validate its practical application.

Result: Agents and humans achieved optimal oversight roles in simulations, with agents deferring under uncertainty and humans effectively overseeing, leading to collaboration and avoiding safety violations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled way to improve safety post-deployment by aligning incentives and enabling emergent collaboration between humans and autonomous agents.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [45] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) use specialized attention heads for compact and portable filtering operations, akin to functional programming filters, and explores alternative filtering strategies used by these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how LLMs encode and perform abstract computational tasks, specifically list-processing operations, to elucidate their learning mechanisms and applicability.

Method: Causal mediation analysis was performed on diverse list-processing tasks to analyze attention heads, particularly focusing on those designated as filter heads and their representation and generalization mechanisms.

Result: Findings show that a few attention heads contain compact, generalizable representations of filtering predicates that can be applied across different tasks and formats, but models may also use alternative flags-based strategies for filtering.

Conclusion: LLMs can emulate computational strategies akin to functional programming principles, demonstrating human-interpretable and generalizable operations for abstract tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

### [46] [CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958)
*Lukas Pfromm,Alish Kanani,Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Umit Y. Ogras*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Traditional chips struggle to meet demands for data-intensive applications due to reduced manufacturing yields, prompting chiplet-based systems as a solution. This paper introduces CHIPSIM, a co-simulation framework for parallel DNN execution on chiplets, achieving enhanced accuracy, speed, and system profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demands of data-intensive applications, such as DNN models, require a scalable and cost-effective solution since traditional monolithic chips face manufacturing challenges.

Method: The paper proposes CHIPSIM, a co-simulation framework that models computation and communication concurrently while accounting for network contention and pipelining effects for accurate simulation.

Result: Evaluations show CHIPSIM's flexibility and a significant accuracy improvement of up to 340%, alongside efficient power/thermal profiling.

Conclusion: CHIPSIM supports the scalability, accuracy, and power optimization needs of chiplet-based architectures, making it suitable for data-intensive applications.

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIREDO, a framework that optimizes CIM architectures for DNN accelerations, achieving up to 3.2x performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIM architectures hold promise for DNN acceleration but face challenges in optimizing dataflow due to a large design space and strict constraints.

Method: The paper proposes MIREDO, formulating dataflow optimization as a Mixed-Integer Programming problem with a hierarchical hardware abstraction and an analytical latency model to capture CIM-specific constraints.

Result: MIREDO achieves significant performance improvements, up to 3.2x, across diverse DNN models and hardware setups.

Conclusion: MIREDO effectively addresses dataflow optimization challenges in CIM architectures, bridging the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark to evaluate the approximation abilities of various LLM architectures in real-world mathematical scenarios, revealing insights into their computational processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on approximate reasoning capabilities of LLMs in informal and fast-paced mathematical operations, particularly for non-autoregressive decoder models.

Method: Introduced the StreetMath benchmark to evaluate LLMs on real-world mathematical approximation tasks. Conducted extensive tests on five LLM architectures and used mechanistic interpretability techniques to analyze their computational states.

Result: Discovered that LLMs prefer exact calculations over approximations, using more tokens even for approximation tasks. They also demonstrated largely separate neural components for exact and approximate arithmetic.

Conclusion: LLMs differ from humans in their lack of cognitive miserliness during approximate reasoning tasks, and their computational behavior does not align with human tendencies in street math scenarios.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode is a framework aiming to improve mathematical problem-solving in Large Language Models (LLMs) by using deterministic code generation instead of prose. It significantly boosts accuracy on benchmarks like MATH-500 and OlympiadBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reliable mathematical reasoning, as traditional prose-based methods like Chain of Thought fail to ensure deterministic verification.

Method: The paper introduces SymCode, a neurosymbolic framework to reframe problem-solving as verifiable code generation using the SymPy library.

Result: SymCode improves accuracy in solving mathematical benchmarks by up to 13.6 percentage points compared to earlier methods.

Conclusion: Grounding LLM reasoning in deterministic symbolic engines like SymPy enhances accuracy, shifts failures from logical errors to programmatic ones, and makes AI more trustworthy in formal domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

### [50] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach for sentiment analysis that ranks entities based on opinion orientation and intensity, incorporating different levels of granularity and leveraging a fuzzy logic-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing holistic lexicon-based approaches in sentiment analysis fail to consider the strength or intensity of opinions, making it difficult to differentiate varying levels of sentiment polarity in opinions.

Method: The proposed method ranks entities by analyzing the orientation and strength of reviews based on user queries. The approach uses a fuzzy logic algorithm to classify opinion words (adverbs, adjectives, nouns, verbs) into granularity levels (e.g., very weak, weak, moderate, strong, very strong). Additionally, syntactic dependency resolution identifies relationships to aspect words.

Result: Using fuzzy logic and syntactic dependency resolution, the system determines scores for entities based on the sentiment intensity associated with specific aspects of interest.

Conclusion: This approach enhances sentiment analysis by providing a detailed system to gauge both the orientation and strength of opinions, delivering a more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments for specific aspects or attributes of entities.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

TL;DR: LLMs are being evaluated for quantum programming with the introduction of QCoder Benchmark, using simulated hardware feedback and human code comparisons for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored application of LLMs in quantum programming, especially where interaction with hardware devices is required.

Method: The authors designed QCoder Benchmark, including a quantum simulator environment for feedback and human code submissions for evaluation.

Result: Advanced LLMs like GPT-4 achieve low accuracy (18.97%), while reasoning-based models perform significantly better (up to 78%), outperforming human-written code averages.

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark highlights the challenges for LLMs in quantum programming, encouraging further refinement in such specialized tasks and supports research with an open dataset and API.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LASTIST dataset for stance detection in Korean, a large-scale dataset containing 563,299 labeled sentences, addressing the lack of resources in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research focuses on English-language datasets and target-specific analysis, leaving low-resource languages like Korean underserved.

Method: The authors collected and labeled 563,299 Korean sentences from political party press releases, designed for various stance detection tasks including target-independent analysis.

Result: The dataset, LASTIST, enables advanced stance detection tasks and supports different models to analyze both target-independent and diachronic stance evolution.

Conclusion: The LASTIST dataset bridges a major gap in the stance detection field, offering resources for improved research in Korean and showcasing its broad application potential to the community.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents zFLoRA, a new zero-latency fused low-rank adapter for large language models (LLMs) that minimizes inference latency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models with task-specific adapters often incur significant inference time due to compute requirements of the adapter parameters, creating a need for efficient solutions.

Method: The researchers propose zFLoRA, a fused low-rank adapter designed to introduce zero or negligible latency overhead during inference. Experiments involved comparing zFLoRA against supervised fine-tuning benchmarks (LoRA and FFT) across multiple tasks.

Result: zFLoRA demonstrated favorable performance across commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue tasks on LLMs sized 1B, 3B, and 7B. The zero/negligible latency was confirmed through measurements using NPU and GPU platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed zFLoRA adapter significantly reduces latency while achieving competitive performance levels, making it an efficient solution for task-specific LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying model components performing specific tasks, aiming for more faithful and systematic circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability.

Method: The authors introduced bootstrapping for consistent attributions, ratio-based selection for edge prioritization, and integer linear programming to replace greedy selection, enhancing circuit reliability.

Result: The proposed methods improved circuit faithfulness and outperformed previous techniques across multiple tasks in the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper presents effective advancements in circuit discovery methodologies, providing better reliability and performance in mechanistic model interpretability.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LISTEN, leveraging LLMs as zero-shot preference oracles to simplify decision-making across multi-objective tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding implicit preferences while selecting from large sets with competing objectives remains a challenge for human experts.

Method: Developed two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U (utility refinement) and LISTEN-T (tournament-style decision-making).

Result: LISTEN-U excels with parametric preferences; LISTEN-T is robust across tasks like flight booking and shopping.

Conclusion: LISTEN reduces cognitive burden in complex decisions via natural language interactions.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongFilter, a framework for efficiently selecting training data for long-context language models to enhance their performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context language models excel at leveraging dependencies across longer text spans, but many available datasets lack meaningful long-range dependencies, leading to inefficiencies during training.

Method: LongFilter identifies valuable long-context data by contrasting a model's predictions using long and short contexts, measuring information gain to pinpoint samples with essential long-range dependencies.

Result: The application of LongFilter improved long-context pretraining efficiency and produced substantial benchmark enhancements with an extended LLaMA-3-8B model.

Conclusion: Curating training data with LongFilter is crucial for optimizing long-context language models and boosts their performance on tasks requiring extended reasoning across text.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

TL;DR: Examined how language models handle numeric information, revealing systematic and universal numeric representations despite errors in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the paradox where LLMs accurately encode numeric representations but struggle with numeric computations.

Method: Analyzed hidden states across different LLMs and developed universal probes to trace numeric information and errors within specific layers.

Result: Identified that numeric representations in LLMs are highly accurate and interchangeable across models, enabling precise probing techniques.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into numeric manipulation in LLMs and drive the development of refined architectures for better numeric processing.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: Large language models can show ideological bias in their harmful content classification, influenced by persona conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the effect of persona adoption on fairness and neutrality in harmful content classification performed by large language models.

Method: Analyzing harmful content classification across various LLM architectures, sizes, and modalities, with a focus on persona-driven behaviors and politically targeted tasks.

Result: Personas affect LLM judgments by introducing ideological biases, with larger models exhibiting stronger alignment to the personas' political ideology.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can subtly affect LLM outputs, raising concerns about bias and reinforcing partisan perspectives in content moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Method: The researchers introduced CLEAR (Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval), tested using a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform, comparing it against zero-shot inference and chunk-based retrieval with augmented generation over 12 clinical notes.

Result: CLEAR achieved a 58.3% win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, used 78% fewer tokens compared to wide context processing, and showed the largest performance gains (75% win rate) on long notes exceeding 65,000 tokens.

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval, as implemented through CLEAR, significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of clinical NLP tasks, providing a validated benchmark for improving clinical question answering systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

TL;DR: The paper provides a systematic survey of data-efficient post-training methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a taxonomy and analysis of approaches to address data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data-intensive post-training of LLMs, such as high manual annotation costs and diminishing data returns, and to improve data efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing data-efficient post-training methods into: data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems.

Result: The paper summarizes representative methods in each category and highlights key challenges and open problems, providing insights for future research directions.

Conclusion: The study aims to inspire solutions for efficient data utilization in training large-scale language models, highlighting emerging research avenues.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) for creating annotated datasets, focusing on semantic role labeling via a FrameNet-like approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and impact of LLM-based tools in assisting or automating the creation of language resources, with emphasis on semantic annotations.

Method: Compared annotation performance across manual, automatic, and semi-automatic settings using an LLM-based semantic role labeling tool. Metrics include annotation time, coverage, and diversity.

Result: Semi-automatic annotation provided better diversity and comparable coverage to manual annotation, while fully automatic annotation was faster but performed worse overall.

Conclusion: Hybrid semi-automatic annotation using LLMs is promising for increasing diversity and maintaining quality, while full automation needs improvement.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [62] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RECAP, a pipeline to elicit and verify the memorized training data of large language models (LLMs), achieving improvements in data extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying memorized training data within LLMs, especially when the training data is inaccessible.

Method: The RECAP pipeline involves iterative extraction guided by feedback from a secondary model to refine outputs and includes a jailbreaking module to handle refusals from alignment constraints.

Result: RECAP demonstrated a 24% increase in ROUGE-L scores for copyrighted text extraction, outperforming single-iteration methods in the EchoTrace benchmark.

Conclusion: The RECAP approach enhances the ability to retrieve memorized data from LLMs, paving the way for better understanding and evaluation of their training contents.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

### [63] [Revisiting Multilingual Data Mixtures in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25947)
*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the effect of multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models, showcasing improved performance across diverse languages when data is balanced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the ongoing debate about the trade-offs between multilingual coverage and performance, particularly questioning whether multilingual data compromises in-language performance.

Method: Researchers trained 1.1B and 3B parameter large language models on multilingual corpora with varying language numbers (25 to 400), including English as a pivot language.

Result: Findings reveal that combining English and multilingual data does not compromise performance for well-represented languages, using English as a pivot aids performance in other languages, and the "curse of multilinguality" is less significant at this scale.

Conclusion: Multilingual pretraining with balanced data enhances language model abilities across diverse settings, disproving concerns about performance trade-offs.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how Machine Translation (MT) systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs), are influenced by cultural alignment and induce label drift, particularly in culturally sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how cultural divergence between source and target languages affects semantic label preservation in Machine Translation and its impact on downstream applications.

Method: Conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains to analyze label drift in translations by MT systems while evaluating the impact of cultural knowledge embedded in LLMs.

Result: The study found that (1) MT systems, especially LLMs, induce label drift in culturally sensitive domains; (2) LLMs encode cultural knowledge, amplifying label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or divergence determines the likelihood of label preservation.

Conclusion: Cultural factors significantly influence label fidelity in MT, and neglecting these can result in misinterpretations and potential cultural conflicts, emphasizing the need for culturally-aware MT.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing high-performance matrix multiplication for LLM inference on AWS's Trainium by introducing techniques specific to its architecture, achieving up to 2.49x speedup for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of leveraging AWS Trainium's specialized architecture for high-performance tasks and optimize matrix multiplication for LLM inference.

Method: The authors design high-performance matrix multiplication by incorporating kernel fusion and novel caching strategies, focusing on reducing data movement, maximizing SRAM bandwidth, and avoiding matrix transpose in Trainium.

Result: The optimized solution achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x) for matrix multiplication and translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve LLM inference performance on Trainium, demonstrating the potential for customized optimizations on AI accelerators.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AttnCache, a framework designed to optimize the prefill stage of LLM inference by reusing attention maps to reduce computation overhead, achieving speedup on both CPU and GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prefill-only scenarios in LLM inference focus on input encoding without autoregressive decoding, where self-attention is a bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity.

Method: AttnCache creates an attention map memorization database and utilizes caching and similarity search to retrieve and reuse prior attention maps for reducing self-attention overhead.

Result: AttnCache achieves 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively accelerates LLM prefill inference without significantly compromising accuracy, demonstrating promising potential for real-world workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

### [67] [Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992)
*Yihe Deng,I-Hung Hsu,Jun Yan,Zifeng Wang,Rujun Han,Gufeng Zhang,Yanfei Chen,Wei Wang,Tomas Pfister,Chen-Yu Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel framework for improving reasoning capabilities in large language models, offering smoother rewards and better performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have limitations in enabling small-scale models to solve challenging reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces SRL, which trains models through logical actions and reasoning monologues, providing step-wise rewards based on similarity to expert reasoning and combining this with expert demonstrations.

Result: SRL allows small models to tackle problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR and achieves the strongest performance when combined with RLVR, while generalizing well to software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: SRL is a robust and versatile framework that advances reasoning-oriented training, improving performance and applicability for small LLMs in both reasoning benchmarks and practical tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool introduces a reinforcement learning-based training method for tool-use LLMs that focuses on exploring diverse tool-call trajectories and optimizing their performance with step-wise rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-use LLMs struggle in dynamic environments as they tend to imitate generic routines without exploring diverse solutions.

Method: PORTool forms tree-like trajectory structures, assigns step-wise rewards based on accuracy and tool-call success, and blends fork-relative and trajectory-relative advantages to train LLMs for improved tool integration.

Result: Experiments across 17 tools show PORTool improves accuracy and reduces tool-call steps compared to other approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PORTool's RL-based training proves robust and necessary for enhancing tool-use LLM performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how cross-lingual alignment in large language models can lead to cultural erasure and proposes a method called Surgical Steering to balance factual transfer and cultural localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of how cross-lingual alignment optimizations might lead to the loss of culturally-situated responses in multilingual LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce a transfer-localization evaluation framework to measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer and cultural erasure. They analyze internal model representations to discover how layers handle universal and cultural knowledge differently, then propose Surgical Steering, an activation-steering method applied at specific layers during inference.

Result: Using Surgical Steering, the paper demonstrates the ability to strike a better balance between knowledge transfer and cultural localization across six studied languages, mitigating cultural erasure.

Conclusion: The research points to the importance of designing methods to handle the trade-off between factual accuracy and cultural representation in multilingual models, addressing shortcomings in current cross-lingual alignment techniques.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) detected in imaging performed for reasons unrelated to thyroid issues. It discusses their prevalence, characteristics, and clinical consequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates ITFs that are increasingly detected in imaging but remain undefined in terms of prevalence, characteristics, and clinical implications.

Method: The researchers developed and validated a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline using transformer models to identify ITFs and extract related characteristics from radiology reports of 115,683 patients without prior thyroid disease.

Result: The analysis revealed 7.8% of the population had ITFs, mostly nodules, which were unevenly documented. ITFs were associated with increased follow-ups such as biopsies and higher detection of thyroid cancer, though often these were small, low-risk cases.

Conclusion: ITFs are common, leading to potential overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. Improving standardized reporting and establishing selective follow-up policies could mitigate unnecessary interventions.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new training paradigm, 'one problem, multiple solutions' (1PNS), to improve reasoning diversity in large language models by exposing them to varied reasoning paths with a metric called Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of low diversity in model outputs caused by the 'one problem, one solution' (1P1S) training practice in large language models.

Method: Introducing the 1PNS paradigm, supported by Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a metric that evaluates semantic differences between reasoning paths. RPD is used to curate diverse solution sets for fine-tuning a specific LLM, Qwen3-4B-Base.

Result: RPD-selected training enhances inference diversity and increases pass@k metrics, with +2.80% improvement on average pass@16 and +4.99% gain on AIME24 compared to the 1P1S baseline.

Conclusion: The 1PNS training paradigm and RPD metric effectively improve both diversity and quality of model outputs, amplifying Test-Time Scaling benefits.

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the link between Persuasion Techniques (PTs) and Discourse Relations (DRs) using LLMs and prompt engineering. It develops and evaluates classifiers, creating silver datasets to uncover crucial discourse relations for persuasive text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how specific discourse relations contribute to the utilization of persuasion techniques, aiming to enhance understanding of persuasive text and support the detection of misinformation and propaganda.

Method: Leveraged four large language models and designed 10 different prompts to classify discourse relations in the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset. Used ensemble models with majority-pooling strategies to create silver datasets and performed statistical analysis.

Result: Created five silver datasets with varying sizes (204 to 1,281 instances). Found six significant discourse relations (Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) that are linked to common persuasion techniques.

Conclusion: The identified discourse relations are closely tied to persuasive communications and can provide valuable insights into detecting online propaganda, misinformation, and enhancing communication strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver

*Shikhar Tuli,James Seale Smith,Haris Jeelani,Chi-Heng Lin,Abhishek Patel,Vasili Ramanishka,Yen-Chang Hsu,Hongxia Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MossNet introduces a novel architecture combining mixture-of-experts in both layers and state-space kernels to outperform existing transformer and SSM methods in NLP while demonstrating scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in expressiveness in SSM/GRM-based models that emulate only a single attention head, and to provide a more efficient and scalable alternative in LLM architecture.

Method: The authors propose MossNet, an architecture that integrates a mixture-of-state-space-experts to emulate linear multi-head attention and leverages MoE in both channel-mixing MLP blocks and time-mixing SSM kernels for greater model expressiveness and performance.

Result: The experiments show that MossNet outperforms similar-sized transformer- and SSM-based architectures in language modeling and downstream tasks. Large variants trained on trillions of tokens demonstrate high scalability and superiority. Profiling on real devices highlights competitive runtime speed and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: MossNet offers a promising alternative for recurrent large language models, combining efficiency and performance, making it a strong direction for future NLP technologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models to improve prediction accuracy through a novel activation layer and fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generation accuracy and reduce abstentions in language models, especially in generating well-calibrated, high-probability outputs for instruction-following tasks.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs, incorporating a final-layer SDM activation layer for binary classification and a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive input encoding scheme. Hard negative examples were also generated online during training.

Result: The proposed SDM LMs demonstrated reduced abstention rates and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing supervised baselines.

Conclusion: SDM LMs represent an effective way to convert pre-trained language models into more efficient and accurate generation systems for specific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [75] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore evaluates how variations in instruction styles affect the performance of LLMs and introduces methodologies like stylistic self-consistency for assessing model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in current evaluations of LLMs that fail to account for sensitivity to varying instruction styles, which is essential for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose RCScore, a framework that systematically transforms benchmarks into various instruction styles, quantifies performance variations caused by instruction shifts, and introduces Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) to measure stylistic self-consistency.

Result: Experiments revealed that instruction style alone can lead to up to 16.7% change in accuracy across ten LLMs. Deterministic decoding enhances stylistic stability, and larger models tend to exhibit higher cross-style consistency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RCScore offers a robust way to assess instruction sensitivity, and consistent stylistic responses serve as a proxy for evaluating model reliability, which is crucial for deployment in varied real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [76] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in controllability within Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) by identifying the issue of "update forgetting" and introducing a solution called Token Timestep Allocation (TTA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the practical limitations of DLMs' controllability caused by uniform and context-agnostic updates, which negatively impact language model fluency and coherence.

Method: The authors propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), a strategy involving per-token timestep schedules to manage soft and semantic token ordering—freezing critical tokens early while refining uncertain ones. TTA operates during inference and is implementable as fixed or adaptive policies.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate improved controllability and fluency, with notable achievements such as 20% higher accuracy in sentiment control and reduced perplexity and toxicity in text detoxification tasks.

Conclusion: TTA effectively mitigates update forgetting in DLMs, providing stable and controllable text generation by emphasizing timestep allocation methods for token refinement.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Rajiv Movva,Smitha Milli,Sewon Min,Emma Pierson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WIMHF, a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders to analyze human preferences in datasets, identifying key features for prediction and enabling safer and more personalized data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preferences embedded in feedback data for language models are not well-understood, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes.

Method: The authors developed WIMHF, a sparse autoencoder approach, to analyze feedback data by identifying interpretable features linked to human preference expressions.

Result: WIMHF identifies human-centered features across datasets that capture preference signals and surfaces dataset-specific, context-dependent traits, including unsafe preferences. It improves data curation for safety and enables annotator-specific personalization.

Conclusion: The method effectively analyzes human feedback, offering insights into preferences, improving safety with curated data, and adapting to individual annotator needs, making feedback data more actionable for language models.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

### [78] [Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Benchmark for Corpus-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26205)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalQA, a new benchmark for evaluating global retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, and proposes GlobalRAG, a novel framework that significantly improves performance in such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks focus on local RAG tasks, which are inadequate for real-world applications requiring global-level insights across entire document collections, prompting the need for a new benchmark and approach.

Method: The authors design GlobalQA to evaluate global RAG capabilities on tasks such as counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction, and introduce GlobalRAG, a framework using chunk-level retrieval, LLM-driven filters, and aggregation modules for improved results.

Result: GlobalRAG achieves an F1 score of 6.63 on the Qwen2.5-14B model, significantly outperforming the previous best baseline (1.51 F1) on the GlobalQA benchmark.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG demonstrates a strong potential for addressing global RAG challenges, providing substantial improvements in extracting corpus-level insights compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how providing language models with pragmatic theories as prompts improves their understanding of implied meanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of language models in interpreting implied meanings, vital in human communication.

Method: The study presents language models with pragmatic theories like Gricean pragmatics and Relevance Theory in prompts, guiding them through step-by-step reasoning.

Result: Language models achieved up to 9.6% improvement in pragmatic reasoning tasks compared to a 0-shot Chain-of-Thought baseline. Even brief mentions of pragmatic theories boosted performance by 1-3%.

Conclusion: Incorporating pragmatic theories into prompts significantly improves language models' performance on tasks involving implied meanings.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether pretrained language models can identify loanwords in bilingual contexts, finding that they struggle despite explicit directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the efficacy of language models in identifying borrowed words from minority languages impacted by dominant languages.

Method: Testing multiple pretrained language models across ten languages to evaluate their identification of loanwords under explicit instructions.

Result: Models generally perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native words, revealing a bias toward loanwords.

Conclusion: Modern NLP systems need improvement to support minority languages and address biases in handling lexical influences from dominant languages.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the effects of five knowledge distillation approaches on multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under model compression, highlighting trade-offs in performance stability and cross-lingual representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uneven performance of VLMs across languages and improve their robustness and performance during model compression, particularly in multilingual settings.

Method: The study performs an empirical analysis of five specific knowledge distillation approaches applied to VLMs using CLIP and SigLIP2, evaluating their effects on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA tasks.

Result: Certain distillation configurations improve multilingual retrieval performance despite reducing model size by half, whereas others lead to inconsistencies in cross-task stability, demonstrating trade-offs in design decisions.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation can enhance cross-lingual representation and performance in compressed VLMs, but careful design choices are crucial to balance trade-offs between accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Internal neuron behaviors of LLMs can guide decoding processes more effectively than external ones, enabling efficient, scalable reasoning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing decoding strategies depend on external signals (e.g., token probabilities) which can be poorly calibrated and limited in representation of internal dynamics.

Method: The authors analyzed neuron activations in LLMs during decoding, revealing patterns in activation sparsity and cross-sample neuron agreement that correlate with correctness.

Result: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), based on activation patterns, matches or outperforms traditional methods, enables early correctness prediction, and reduces token usage significantly.

Conclusion: NAD demonstrates that leveraging internal neuron signals is an efficient, robust, and scalable way to enhance label-free ensemble decoding in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

TL;DR: The paper assesses OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas in browser-based games, highlighting strengths in logical reasoning but highlighting struggle in real-time, interactive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the web interaction capabilities of ChatGPT Atlas in dynamic, interactive browser environments.

Method: Using browser-based games as test cases (e.g., Sudoku, Flappy Bird), performance was measured using in-game metrics and scores.

Result: Atlas excelled in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but performed poorly in real-time games needing precision and timing.

Conclusion: Atlas shows strong analytical abilities but faces limitations in handling dynamic, real-time interactive tasks.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a framework using small, open-source language models for generating valid and privacy-sensitive, personalized student feedback effectively, comparable to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in real-world deployment of language models for student feedback, such as privacy, computational resource limitations, and ensuring pedagogical validity.

Method: SCRIBE utilizes multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning combined with a self-reflective inference pipeline to generate iterative, grounded responses. Fine-tuning of smaller models (3B and 8B) was done via two-stage LoRA on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data.

Result: 8B-SCRIBE model performs as well or better than much larger models like GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B in terms of relevance and actionability of feedback, confirmed by human-aligned GPT-Judge evaluations and a 108-student user study.

Conclusion: SCRIBE demonstrates the potential for low-resource and privacy-sensitive deployment of small, open-source language models in educational settings, providing quality comparable to larger models.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER improves Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains while maintaining general capabilities using a structured curriculum approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in specialized domains like economics and psychology, requiring a solution to enhance their domain expertise without losing generalist abilities.

Method: ACER generates a synthetic curriculum with progressively tough question-answer pairs based on Bloom’s taxonomy, followed by continual pretraining using an interleaved curriculum schedule.

Result: Experiments show ACER improves domain performance with consistent gains (up to 5% in microeconomics) and prevents catastrophic forgetting while enhancing cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: ACER provides a scalable method to specialize LLMs in critical domains while securing performance in broader reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MisSynth, a pipeline that uses synthetic data generation to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize scientific misinformation and fallacious arguments, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is widespread and harmful, and detecting fallacious arguments that distort scientific findings is challenging, necessitating improved tools.

Method: The approach involves creating synthetic fallacy examples using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning LLMs with these samples using the MISSCI dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM models, such as LLaMA 3.1 8B, showed a 35% F1-score improvement compared to their vanilla versions when tested on scientific misinformation tasks.

Conclusion: Synthetic fallacy data generation and fine-tuning improve LLM performance considerably for misinformation detection, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data and computational resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops an interaction-centric framework for forming optimal multi-agent teams composed of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging semantic coherence in pairwise interactions, without prior knowledge of model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of forming optimal synergistic teams of large language models due to the opacity of internal model characteristics.

Method: The method involves constructing a language model graph mapping semantic relationships, applying community detection to identify model clusters, and analyzing clusters to form teams without requiring prior model knowledge.

Result: The experiments showed that the proposed method forms functionally coherent teams, outperforming random baselines and achieving accuracy comparable to manually-curated teams.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently identifies synergistic LLM groups, enabling automated collaborative multi-agent system design and enhancing their downstream task performances.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM

*Stephen Wan,Wei Liu,Michael Strube*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of pretrained language models and large language models for classifying discourse relations in scientific texts, highlighting the importance of context in the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance AI-supported scientific workflows by utilizing discourse-level information to identify supporting evidence for AI-generated scientific claims.

Method: The research examines pretrained and large language models for Discourse Relation Classification in scientific publications, incorporating context derived from discourse structure.

Result: Experiments reveal that incorporating context generally improves the performance of Discourse Relation Classification. Specific discourse relation types in scientific texts benefit most from contextual information.

Conclusion: Context derived from discourse structure is beneficial for discourse relation classification in scientific texts, providing insights for improving AI methods and supporting scientific workflows.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

### [89] [OmniEduBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26422)
*Min Zhang,Hao Chen,Hao Chen,Wenqi Zhang,Didi Zhu,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniEduBench, a Chinese educational benchmark to evaluate LLMs, emphasizing both knowledge and cultivation dimensions with detailed data spanning 61 subjects and diverse question formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks that evaluate educational capabilities of large language models in a holistic manner, especially incorporating cultivation dimensions and covering diverse subjects in the Chinese context.

Method: Created OmniEduBench, a dataset with 24.602K question-answer pairs categorized into knowledge and cultivation dimensions, each subdivided, spanning 61 subjects and 11 question types.

Result: Tests on 11 LLMs show a performance gap; only one surpassed 60% accuracy in knowledge, and performance in the cultivation dimension lagged significantly behind human intelligence.

Conclusion: LLMs have a significant potential to improve in educational applications, as shown by the benchmark's results and the clear challenges revealed in addressing these dimensions comprehensively.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

### [90] [1+1>2: A Synergistic Sparse and Low-Rank Compression Method for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26446)
*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Synergistic Sparse and Low-Rank Compression (SSLC) methods which combine pruning and low-rank approximation to compress large language models (LLMs) without performance losses, enhancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bandwidth and computational inefficiencies of LLMs and improve compression methods using the strengths of both low-rank approximation and sparse optimization.

Method: The authors formulate a unified optimization problem combining low-rank approximation and sparse optimization, and solve it using iterative optimization techniques.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SSLC can compress LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B sizes) by up to 50% with no performance drop and provide at least 1.63× speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC is an effective technique for compressing and efficiently deploying LLMs, achieving superior performance compared to standalone methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

### [91] [Bayesian Network Fusion of Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26484)
*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF), to improve sentiment analysis by integrating predictions from multiple domain-specific LLMs, achieving better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges such as lack of transparency, high costs of fine-tuning, inconsistent domain performance, and environmental impacts associated with large language models (LLMs).

Method: The BNLF framework integrates predictions from three LLMs (FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet) using a probabilistic mechanism within a Bayesian network for late-stage fusion.

Result: BNLF demonstrated consistent gains of approximately six percent in accuracy over individual LLMs across three human-annotated financial datasets with varying characteristics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that probabilistic fusion through BNLF offers a robust and interpretable solution for sentiment classification, addressing the limitations of standalone domain-specific LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

### [92] [A Multi-agent Large Language Model Framework to Automatically Assess Performance of a Clinical AI Triage Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26498)
*Adam E. Flanders,Yifan Peng,Luciano Prevedello,Robyn Ball,Errol Colak,Prahlad Menon,George Shih,Hui-Ming Lin,Paras Lakhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the utility of ensembles of large language models (LLMs) in evaluating an AI triage tool for intracranial hemorrhage detection on CT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether using a collective ensemble of multiple LLMs provides improved performance and reliability over a single LLM in evaluating a clinical AI triage tool's assessment.

Method: 29,766 non-contrast CT head scans were processed by an AI tool for intracranial hemorrhage detection. An ensemble of eight open-source LLMs and an internal GPT-4o model were evaluated using multi-shot prompts. A subset of 1,726 cases was manually reviewed for performance comparison with the ensemble approaches against GPT-4o.

Result: The best individual models were Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o, both with AUC scores of 0.78. The ideal combinations of LLM ensembles showed improved performance metrics (e.g., MCC: Full-9 at 0.571, Top-3 at 0.558) compared to single LLM use, though no significant difference was observed among ensemble configurations.

Conclusion: Ensembles of LLMs outperform a single LLM solution in providing consistent and reliable ground truth evaluation for clinical AI triage tools, demonstrating their effectiveness in retrospective studies.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

### [93] [Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512)
*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG improves knowledge graph construction from complex legal texts using a domain-specific, structured approach and coreference resolution, reducing issues like node duplication and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of noisy, ambiguous, and fragmented data in automated knowledge graph construction from lexically dense legal documents.

Method: Developed the CORE-KG framework, incorporating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, and conducted an ablation study to evaluate their contributions.

Result: Coreference resolution reduces node duplication by 28.32% and legal noise by 4.32%; structured prompts reduce node duplication by 4.34% and legal noise by 73.33%.

Conclusion: CORE-KG demonstrates significant improvements in the quality of automated knowledge graphs, providing a clear path for better LLM-based legal text analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

### [94] [Hebrew Diacritics Restoration using Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26521)
*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritics restoration, utilizing a Hebrew Visual Language Model to improve accuracy and generalization without explicit linguistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurately restoring diacritics in Hebrew, which is necessary for proper pronunciation and disambiguation, and is a difficult task due to the high ambiguity in unvocalized text.

Method: DIVRIT transforms diacritization into a zero-shot classification problem by dynamically selecting the most suitable diacritization pattern for an undiacritized word using a Hebrew Visual Language Model that embeds diacritics information within vector representations of text.

Result: The results show that DIVRIT performs diacritization effectively, achieving high accuracy in scenarios where the appropriate diacritized form is among the provided candidates, and benefits from improved generalization due to enhanced architectural and training methodologies.

Conclusion: The work underscores the potential of employing visual language models for handling Hebrew diacritization in an automated and accurate manner without relying on traditional complex linguistic analysis.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [95] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the redundancy and structure of linear operators decoding relational facts in transformer language models, finding that they are property-based rather than relation-specific.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and optimize decoding mechanisms in transformer models for relational data.

Method: Extend single-relation findings to multiple relations, analyze using tensor networks and apply cross-evaluation protocols.

Result: Linear decoders extract recurring semantic properties, enabling significant compression without sacrificing decoding accuracy.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding encodes semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining compressibility and generalization patterns.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoFlow, a framework to address low reward density in deep search scenarios to improve agent exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of low reward density in reinforcement learning, which impacts agent performance during deep search scenarios.

Method: InfoFlow framework employs subproblem decomposition, failure-guided hints, and dual-agent refinement to optimize reward density.

Result: InfoFlow significantly improves performance on agentic search benchmarks, allowing lightweight LLMs to compete with advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances reward density, improving exploration efficiency for reinforcement learning agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

*Yinrong Hong,Zhiquan Tan,Kai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CAST, a novel decoding method that significantly improves LLM inference speed and outperforms existing methods by accounting for GPU configurations and batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models suffer from high inference latencies due to their autoregressive design and size, necessitating efficient decoding methods.

Method: The paper introduces CAST, a dynamic tree decoding technique that optimizes tree structure based on inference costs, incorporating GPU configurations and batch sizes.

Result: The CAST approach achieves up to 5.2x speed improvement over conventional decoding methods and surpasses state-of-the-art techniques by 5-20% across six tasks and six LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST is a promising solution for reducing inference latency in LLMs by refining speculative decoding through consideration of system configurations and dynamic adjustments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents SlideAgent, a tool for better understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout visual documents like slide decks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges current systems face with comprehending complex, multi-page visual documents, especially for fine-grained reasoning across elements and slides.

Method: SlideAgent uses specialized agents and decomposes the reasoning process into three levels: global, page, and element. It creates a query-agnostic structured representation of both overarching themes and detailed visual/textual cues.

Result: SlideAgent demonstrates significant performance improvements, outperforming proprietary models by +7.9 and open-source models by +9.8 points overall.

Conclusion: SlideAgent sets a new benchmark for understanding complex documents, making strides in fine-grained, multi-level reasoning for multi-modal visual documents.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits encoder-decoder models in large language models (LLMs) research, comparing them to the dominant decoder-only models from a scaling perspective. Results show encoder-decoder models perform strongly and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the overlooked potential of encoder-decoder models in LLM research as decoder-only architectures dominate.

Method: Enhanced encoder-decoder model (RedLLM) with innovations from decoder-only models, conducted pretraining at various scales (150M to 8B parameters) and instruction tuning using RedPajama V1 and FLAN.

Result: RedLLM matches or outperforms decoder-only models on various tasks, showing robust scaling, context extrapolation, better inference efficiency, despite decoder-only models being slightly more compute-optimal.

Conclusion: Encoder-decoder models remain competitive and efficient options for LLM development, with promising potential unlocked through re-examination and updated methodologies.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

*Mingchen Tu,Zhiqiang Liu,Juan Li,Liangyurui Liu,Junjie Wang,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree is a new framework that uses a small set of high-quality ontology rules to improve large language models for specialized applications like healthcare without needing extensive external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In healthcare and other data-sensitive domains, large language models struggle due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data.

Method: Evontree extracts domain knowledge via ontology rules, detects inconsistencies, and enhances the model through self-distilled fine-tuning based on extracted and validated knowledge.

Result: Evontree significantly improves Large Language Models’ performance on medical QA benchmarks, surpassing unmodified models and supervised baselines with accuracy improvements of up to 3.7%.

Conclusion: The framework is proven effective, efficient, and robust for adapting language models to specialized domains like healthcare under low-resource conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that surpasses full attention in performance and efficiency across multiple scenarios. It achieves scalability, reduced computational cost, faster decoding throughput, and has open-source support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a scalable and efficient attention mechanism that outperforms existing full attention models, particularly for tasks requiring long-context handling or reinforcement learning scaling.

Method: Introduced Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), extending Gated DeltaNet with enhanced gating, alongside a chunkwise algorithm using Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices. The system uses a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention for pretraining.

Result: Kimi Linear pretrained model exceeded full attention architectures in performance across tasks, reduced KV cache usage by 75%, and achieved 6x decoding throughput for 1M context length.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear can replace full attention architectures as a better-performing and more efficient model. Its open-source release supports broader research and development in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior

### [102] [The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697)
*Zhichao Wang,Dongyang Ma,Xinting Huang,Deng Cai,Tian Lan,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Xiaoying Tang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco introduces a method for large language models (LLMs) to dynamically predict decoding hyperparameters (temperature, top-p) and perform end-to-end generation, outperforming traditional decoding strategies and enabling instruction-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on non-differentiable decoding with manually tuned hyperparameters, making it inefficient and limiting in terms of adaptability.

Method: Augments the transformer architecture with lightweight heads that dynamically predict temperature and top-p values along with next-token logits, enabling parametric and token-level self-regulated decoding.

Result: AutoDeco significantly improves over default decoding strategies, matches oracle-tuned baselines, and demonstrates emergent capabilities for instruction-driven decoding adaptability.

Conclusion: AutoDeco shifts the paradigm of LLM decoding to enable steerable, interactive generation and provides a step forward in achieving truly end-to-end language model architectures.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

### [103] [Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707)
*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how alignment with human values arises during LLM post-training, analyzing value shifts during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying LLM alignment with human values is essential because LLMs increasingly require aligning with human value systems beyond general knowledge. Prior research focuses on evaluating trained models without analyzing training dynamics.

Method: The paper explores value alignment during LLM post-training using experiments with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models across varying sizes, SFT phases, and preference optimization algorithms. It also employs a synthetic preference dataset to manipulate values and examine alignment outcomes.

Result: Findings indicate that the SFT phase establishes values in LLMs, while preference optimization rarely re-aligns them. Different preference optimization algorithms produce varying alignment results even with the same preference data.

Conclusion: The results inform effective data curation and choice of algorithms for improving LLM alignment with human values, emphasizing the influence of training dynamics during post-training phases.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

### [104] [AMO-Bench: Large Language Models Still Struggle in High School Math Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26768)
*Shengnan An,Xunliang Cai,Xuezhi Cao,Xiaoyu Li,Yehao Lin,Junlin Liu,Xinxuan Lv,Dan Ma,Xuanlin Wang,Ziwen Wang,Shuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a benchmark for advanced mathematical reasoning, featuring 50 Olympiad-level problems. It provides a challenging new standard for evaluating large language models since existing benchmarks are becoming less effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue that current benchmarks using high school math competitions are no longer effective for evaluating the top-tier large language models due to performance saturation.

Method: The authors developed AMO-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 50 International Mathematical Olympiad-level math problems, cross-validated by experts to ensure difficulty and originality, and designed for automatic evaluation using only final answers.

Result: Experimental results showed that the best-performing model only achieved 52.4% accuracy, with most models scoring below 40%, but the study revealed that test-time compute scaling could improve performance.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench demonstrates the need to improve mathematical reasoning in language models and serves as a new, challenging benchmark to advance this capability, which is made available for research purposes.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Gistify, a task for coding LLMs to summarize codebases into essential components that reproduce specified functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing automated, codebase-level evaluation methods for coding agents working on large-scale codebases.

Method: They introduce Gistify, a task requiring coding LLMs to generate minimal, self-contained files that replicate specific outputs of a codebase, given full codebase access and an entrypoint.

Result: Findings indicate state-of-the-art models struggle with Gistify, particularly on tasks involving long execution traces.

Conclusion: Further advancements are needed in coding LLMs to improve their structural understanding of codebases and their ability to handle complex tasks requiring large code patches.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

### [106] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper assesses spatio-temporal modeling for underwater object detection using T-YOLOv5 models, showing enhanced detection accuracy overall, especially in challenging environments compared to standard YOLOv5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve underwater object detection, addressing challenges like dynamic environments, sudden movements, and partial occlusions by leveraging enhanced deep learning models.

Method: Two modeling phases were conducted. First, comparing temporal-enhanced T-YOLOv5 with standard YOLOv5. Second, augmenting T-YOLOv5 with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to observe its performance in complex underwater scenarios.

Result: T-YOLOv5 achieved superior mAP@50-95 (0.813) accuracy compared to YOLOv5 (0.563). Adding CBAM leads to marginal accuracy enhancement in challenging scenarios (maintaining mAP score of 0.811), despite lower performance in simpler contexts.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms significantly improves object detection in underwater conditions, especially in uneven and difficult environments, though trade-offs exist for simpler tasks.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current generative models rely on large uncurated datasets, yet optimizing for single post-hoc rewards negatively impacts diversity and quality. MIRO introduces multi-reward conditioning during training, enhancing image quality, training efficiency, and achieving state-of-the-art user preference performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between large uncurated generative datasets and user-specific preferences, avoiding post-hoc processes that sacrifice diversity and fidelity.

Method: MIRO, a model conditioned on multiple reward signals during training, directly incorporates user preferences into the generative process.

Result: MIRO improves visual quality of generated images and significantly accelerates training, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks in compositional tasks and user preference metrics.

Conclusion: By conditioning training on multiple reward models instead of post-hoc selection, MIRO aligns generative models with user preferences, ensuring higher quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Brain-IT, a transformative approach using a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) for reconstructing images seen by individuals from their fMRI recordings, overcoming challenges of faithfulness to the actual images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing images from fMRI often lack fidelity to the actual seen images, necessitating improved techniques for bridging brain data and image reconstruction with limited data.

Method: The researchers developed BIT, which employs shared functional-clusters derived from brain-voxels for inter-subject information integration. BIT predicts semantic and structural features to guide diffusion models in image reconstruction.

Result: Brain-IT achieves superior reconstructions of seen images from fMRI data compared to state-of-the-art approaches, using only 1-hour of fMRI data for new subjects to achieve competitive results.

Conclusion: The Brain-IT approach sets a new benchmark for reconstructing images from brain recordings with enhanced accuracy and data efficiency, demonstrating the power of voxel-cluster modeling and feature prediction through BIT.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses cyclist safety by adapting automotive perception technologies, using a tailored 3D LiDAR segmentation approach and introducing the BikeScenes dataset to advance cyclist-centric perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclists face increased risks, especially with the rise of faster e-bikes, necessitating improved safety technologies through perception systems.

Method: A 3D LiDAR segmentation approach and a novel BikeScenes-lidarseg dataset are developed and evaluated using fine-tuning for cyclist-specific perception.

Result: Fine-tuning with the BikeScenes dataset achieved a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, outperforming SemanticKITTI pre-training (13.8%).

Conclusion: Domain-specific training is both necessary and effective for cyclist perception systems, with the BikeScenes dataset contributing to research advancements in this area.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning method to enhance STM image acquisition speed and quality through image repair and super-resolution, using a dataset of 36 pristine experimental images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in STM imaging such as tip degradation, slow data acquisition, and fabrication complexities that affect tip conditioning.

Method: The authors propose a machine learning framework trained with a synthetic data generation pipeline and experimental images, leveraging flow-matching and diffusion models.

Result: The method successfully restores STM images, reduces acquisition times by two- to fourfold, and achieves quantitative improvements using metrics like CMMD and structural similarity.

Conclusion: The framework enhances STM experimental efficiency by reducing tip-conditioning frequency and improving image acquisition speed, potentially increasing throughput in STM systems.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [111] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel inversion-free framework for improved image editing using rectified flow models by decomposing the target prompt and aggregating it with a projection mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rectified flow models struggle with precise image editing due to limitations in inversion processes and gradient entanglement, which lead to unsatisfactory outputs.

Method: The authors propose a decomposition-and-aggregation framework. They semantically decompose the target prompt into sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them using a projection and soft-aggregation mechanism that resolves gradient conflicts.

Result: The proposed approach shows enhanced semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement in image editing compared to existing zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: This new method addresses the limitations of previous techniques and achieves more consistent and semantically diverse results, advancing the capabilities of rectified flow models in image editing tasks.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI sequences under data scarcity, using SAM-based segmentation strategies and achieving a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to tackle the challenge of real-time tumor tracking for MRI-guided radiotherapy, particularly under conditions of strong data scarcity, aiming to improve the precision and utility of such methods in clinical settings.

Method: Two methods were explored: (1) unsupervised registration using the IMPACT similarity metric, and (2) SAM 2.1-based segmentation leveraging prompt-based interaction. The SAM-based method was fine-tuned with a small labeled dataset using a balanced Dice + IoU loss, low learning rates, and standard augmentations, while adhering to strict runtime constraints.

Result: The refined SAM 2.1-based segmentation method achieved a Dice score of 0.8794 on the hidden test set and secured 6th place in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the capability of foundation models like SAM for accurate and efficient tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, even amidst stringent data and runtime limitations.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved scanning method called Hilbert Selective Scan for the Mamba framework, enhancing feature space exploration, spatial locality, and computational efficiency in low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the need for better feature space exploration and spatial locality in Mamba-based low-light image enhancement, while maintaining efficiency and improving both quantitative and visual results.

Method: The proposed Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism increases the Hausdorff dimension of the scanning pattern, enhancing coverage and detail capturing without compromising on handling long-range dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments showed significant improvements in quantitative metrics, visual fidelity, and computational efficiency for low-light image enhancement methods based on Mamba.

Conclusion: The refined strategy not only enhances the state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement but indicates potential for other applications relying on Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAVE, a benchmark for real-world visual anomalies focusing on anomaly description, explanation, and justification, highlighting the challenges current Vision-Language Models face in anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection in computer vision is limited to industrial or synthetic anomalies and fails to address real-world complexity. The work is inspired by human cognitive abilities to recognize and reason about anomalies.

Method: The authors developed the CAVE benchmark with fine-grained annotations for anomaly description, grounding, and categorization by aspects such as complexity and severity. It evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on these tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models struggle significantly with detecting and reasoning about anomalies, even with advanced prompting strategies.

Conclusion: CAVE is a realistic and cognitively grounded tool that can advance research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning for VLMs.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CNN-based model for predicting coastal flooding, demonstrating high accuracy and generalizability across varied geographical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and accurate flood prediction methods due to escalating threats of climate change and sea-level rise.

Method: A lightweight vision-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework is designed to predict coastal flooding under varying SLR projections and shoreline adaptation scenarios, using datasets from regions like Abu Dhabi and San Francisco.

Result: The proposed model reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by nearly 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods in flood depth mapping.

Conclusion: The model is a scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, aiding policymakers in climate change mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research introduces a new Video-LLM architecture with stacked temporal attention in the vision encoder, improving temporal reasoning and outperforming existing models in video-related question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLM models struggle with understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos, particularly in tasks requiring detailed action sequence comprehension and temporal progression.

Method: The paper proposes a new architecture featuring stacked temporal attention modules within the vision encoder to capture action progression and frame relationships before passing the information to the LLM.

Result: The proposed approach significantly enhances temporal reasoning abilities, achieving up to +5.5% improvement in benchmarks such as VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME, particularly in tasks like action recognition.

Conclusion: By integrating temporal attention into the vision encoder, the study addresses key limitations of existing Video-LLMs, offering notable improvements in video understanding and performance.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlexICL, a novel deep learning framework for efficient segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound images, achieving robust performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for common pediatric elbow and wrist fractures through automatic ultrasound image segmentation, addressing the challenge of limited and costly labeled data.

Method: FlexICL, a flexible in-context learning framework, is proposed. It leverages selective expert annotations and innovative image concatenation techniques, alongside augmentation strategies for enhanced segmentation performance.

Result: FlexICL demonstrated robust segmentation across four ultrasound datasets using only 5% of training images. It outperformed other models by 1-27% in Dice coefficient on 1,252 ultrasound sweeps.

Conclusion: FlexICL is a promising and efficient solution for ultrasound image segmentation, showing scalability and high efficacy, especially suitable for applications in medical imaging with limited labeled datasets.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic approach to negative prompting in diffusion models using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adaptive prompt generation during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional Negative Prompting methods that rely on fixed negative prompts and to achieve better text-image alignment in diffusion models.

Method: The proposed method uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to query intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and generate contextually relevant negative prompts.

Result: The approach was tested on various benchmark datasets, showcasing the interplay between the strength of negative guidance and improved text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic Negative Prompting, assisted by VLMs, effectively enhances the denoising process in diffusion models by generating adaptive and contextually suitable negative prompts.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [119] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines vulnerabilities in multi-modal diffusion models, proposing a novel attack method, Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA), that manipulates the generated content by modifying input images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address and reveal the susceptibility and risks of misalignment between text and image modalities in multi-modal diffusion models, which can lead to inappropriate or unsafe outputs.

Method: The paper introduces PReMA, an attack that targets image-based inputs (not textual prompts) to manipulate model outputs while preserving fixed prompts.

Result: Comprehensive testing shows that PReMA is effective in tasks like image inpainting and style transfer, across various multi-modal diffusion models.

Conclusion: PReMA highlights the vulnerabilities of multi-modal diffusion models and emphasizes the need for integrity safeguards in such systems, especially for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoExo-Con, a benchmark to evaluate the consistency of temporal understanding in Video-LLMs across egocentric and exocentric views. It identifies limitations in current model performance and proposes a reinforcement learning framework, View-GRPO, to improve consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs lack the ability to consistently comprehend events across synchronized video streams from different viewpoints.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark (EgoExo-Con) and proposed View-GRPO, a reinforcement learning framework to improve cross-view temporal reasoning and consistency.

Result: View-GRPO shows better performance in ensuring temporal comprehension consistency across egocentric and exocentric video pairs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: This paper highlights the weaknesses of Video-LLMs in cross-view consistency and provides a novel solution with View-GRPO, contributing to advancements in video-based AI understanding.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is an advanced agent system utilizing multimodal tools and a domain-specific knowledge base to enhance the management and retrieval of Oracle Bone Script (OBS) information, surpassing mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in efficiency and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OBS research faces challenges in handling complex workflows and inefficient information organization and retrieval.

Method: OracleAgent integrates large language models with OBS analysis tools and utilizes a meticulously curated multimodal knowledge base containing images and interpretation texts.

Result: Extensive experiments show OracleAgent outperforms leading MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, optimizing research efficiency.

Conclusion: OracleAgent presents a groundbreaking advancement for OBS research, providing automated tools and reducing research time for experts.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework is introduced to jointly optimize 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without external tools like COLMAP. It improves reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy through co-optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional view synthesis methods depend on tools like COLMAP, which can be inefficient and error-prone. This research aims to eliminate dependency on such external tools by developing a self-contained framework.

Method: The method involves co-optimizing 3D Gaussian points and camera poses using interleaved phases—first, differentiable rendering refines Gaussian parameters, and second, a 3D optical flow algorithm refines camera poses with geometric and photometric constraints.

Result: Results show this method excels compared to COLMAP-free techniques and outperforms COLMAP-based baselines in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more efficient and accurate alternative for novel view synthesis by eliminating reliance on traditional tools and leveraging innovative co-optimization strategies.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E), emphasizing long-tail, challenging driving scenarios, and proposes a novel evaluation metric called Rater Feedback Score (RFS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end (E2E) driving benchmarks and metrics do not sufficiently address challenging, rare driving scenarios or adequately evaluate multimodal driving performance.

Method: The study curates WOD-E2E, a dataset composed of 4,021 driving segments for rare scenarios, and introduces Rater Feedback Score (RFS), which assesses trajectory predictions based on rater preference annotations.

Result: The dataset provides high-quality curated data featuring rare driving situations, and the proposed RFS offers a more robust evaluation compared to conventional metrics.

Conclusion: This work aims to promote advancements in autonomous driving research by addressing gaps in evaluation methodologies and providing resources for robust and generalizable driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating gradient-based attention into CNN representations specifically for RGB-D indoor SLAM to enhance localization and mapping performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gradient-based attention methods show potential, but their explicit integration into CNN representations for semantic object understanding is limited. This gap is particularly prominent in tasks like indoor SLAM.

Method: The authors combine layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN features to enhance frame association performance in indoor SLAM tasks.

Result: Experiments show improved results compared to baseline methods, especially in large environments.

Conclusion: Incorporating attention information from gradients into CNN improves object understanding and enhances localization performance in indoor SLAM scenarios.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FullPart, a framework for generating 3D parts combining implicit and explicit methods, and presents PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part generators either lack geometric detail or suffer quality degradation due to shared low-resolution grids.

Method: FullPart employs an implicit box vector-set diffusion process for bounding box layout and generates detailed parts within individual high-resolution voxel grids, along with a center-point encoding strategy for better part alignment.

Result: FullPart achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation, demonstrating improved geometric detail and global coherence.

Conclusion: FullPart enhances 3D part generation by combining implicit and explicit methods, providing detailed geometries and addressing data scarcity with PartVerse-XL dataset release.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing video resolution effectively at various scaling factors while addressing challenges like spatial detail preservation, temporal consistency, and computational complexity.

Method: The paper proposes BasicAVSR utilizing (1) adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, (2) a flow-guided propagation unit, (3) second-order motion compensation, and (4) hyper-upsampling for content-independent scaling.

Result: BasicAVSR achieves superior super-resolution quality, improved generalization capabilities, and faster inference speeds, demonstrating effectiveness across online, limited lookahead, and offline tasks.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR sets a new benchmark in AVSR, showcasing adaptability and performance in diverse application scenarios, supported by publicly available code for broader adoption.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

TL;DR: The paper presents a model combining multi-view mammography and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for breast cancer sensing and risk prediction with synthetic data, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of creating robust CAD models for breast cancer detection despite the high cost and time required for annotated medical imaging datasets.

Method: Developed the Multi-View Mammography and Language Model (MV-MLM), which uses synthetic radiology reports and multi-view supervision for joint visual-textual learning.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance across malignancy classification, subtype classification, and cancer risk prediction tasks using both private and public datasets.

Conclusion: MV-MLM offers high accuracy, generalization over multiple datasets, and strong data efficiency, potentially bypassing the need for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine-learning system using the YOLOv8 model for real-time detection of auto-rickshaws in traffic images, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-rickshaws in South Asia need monitoring due to traffic restrictions, and current methods are inefficient or inaccurate.

Method: The study uses the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection with a dataset of 1,730 annotated images collected in varied traffic conditions.

Result: The proposed system achieves high accuracy in detecting auto-rickshaws, with an mAP50 score of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values above 78%.

Conclusion: The model proved effective in detecting auto-rickshaws in diverse traffic situations and facilitates better monitoring, with the dataset made available for future studies.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people

benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

*Wontae Choi,Jaelin Lee,Hyung Sup Yun,Byeungwoo Jeon,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoTDiff, the first high-resolution motion trajectory estimation framework using diffusion models, addressing inaccuracies in motion representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate motion estimation is essential for computational imaging and computer vision, but existing methods often provide low-quality, coarse results.

Method: MoTDiff uses a conditional diffusion framework with multi-scale feature maps and a novel training method to extract fine-grained motion trajectories from single blurred images.

Result: MoTDiff effectively identifies precise motion trajectories and performs better than current state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.

Conclusion: MoTDiff provides a significant improvement in high-quality motion trajectory estimation, showcasing its potential across various computational imaging applications.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

*Jinho Choi,Hyesu Lim,Steffen Schneider,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope is an automated framework leveraging vision foundation models to identify and quantify biases and human-interpretable concepts in visual datasets, aiding in bias evaluation and dataset auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of systematically identifying dataset biases without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations.

Method: ConceptScope uses Sparse Autoencoders trained on vision foundation model representations to discover, quantify, and categorize concepts, enabling bias identification and dataset characterization.

Result: ConceptScope demonstrated its ability to capture diverse visual concepts, produce spatial attributions aligned with semantically meaningful regions, detect known biases, and uncover unannotated biases in datasets.

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a scalable and practical tool for dataset auditing, bias identification, and robustness evaluation, facilitating better dataset analysis and model diagnostics.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for 3D human pose estimation from sketches using synthetic data and a data-driven framework, achieving improvements in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in sketch-to-pose estimation due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches and the lack of large-scale sketch-3D annotations.

Method: The authors propose a 'learn from synthesis' strategy, employing a trained diffusion model to generate a synthetic dataset (SKEP-120K) and an end-to-end framework combining feature extraction, feed-forward neural networks, and heuristic loss functions.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance over previous methods in estimation accuracy and speed through qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: Using synthetic sketches and their annotations to train the model enables effective 3D human pose estimation, demonstrating significant improvement for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN), a hybrid deep learning method, achieving exceptional accuracy in supply chain risk management and sustainability enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks in supply chain management and improve sustainability and performance efficiency using advanced deep learning techniques.

Method: A novel hybrid deep learning architecture named Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) was utilized to analyze supply chain datasets, leveraging dependencies to derive unseen information.

Result: The Ch-EGN achieved high accuracy across multiple classifications, including risk management (98.95%), product classification (100%), relation classification (98.07%), and company relation classification (92.37%).

Conclusion: Ch-EGN architecture demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, establishing its efficacy in improving supply chain risk management and sustainability.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OmniLayout-1M, a diverse dataset for document layout generation, and OmniLayout-LLM, a two-stage learning model that outperforms existing methods in varied domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout generation is underexplored due to the scarcity of diverse layouts and dominance of Manhattan-style structures in literature.

Method: The paper curates OmniLayout-1M, a large, diverse dataset of six document types, and introduces OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model using a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning process.

Result: OmniLayout-LLM demonstrated superior performance in multiple domains, outperforming existing layout generation methods and general-purpose language models.

Conclusion: This research addresses the gap in document layout generation by introducing a diverse dataset and an advanced model, contributing to significant improvements in this field.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a benchmark to assess vision-language models' ability to infer temporal direction in videos and notes their poor performance compared to human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models currently struggle with understanding and evaluating temporal information in videos, a weakness that hampers their performance on related multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors created AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark, to test VLMs' capability to judge the arrow of time (forward vs backward) in natural video clips using human behavioral baselines.

Result: Most evaluated vision-language models performed near chance level and significantly below human accuracy, particularly on tasks involving physically irreversible processes and causal manual actions.

Conclusion: Current multimodal systems lack the necessary inductive biases for temporal and causal reasoning. The released benchmark and data aim to stimulate progress in this area.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the robustness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in handling multi-modal real-world perturbations and proposes a RobustVLA approach, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with robustness under multi-modal real-world perturbations, affecting their deployment and performance in practical scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce RobustVLA, which enhances robustness by leveraging offline robust optimization, adversarial training, and a multi-armed bandit algorithm to tackle perturbations in inputs and outputs.

Result: RobustVLA achieves notable performance improvements, including absolute gains of 12.6% and 10.4% on different backbones, faster inference speeds, and a significant 65.6% gain under multi-modal perturbations on a real-world robot.

Conclusion: RobustVLA demonstrates enhanced robustness in VLA models against diverse perturbations, making it effective for real-world applications with faster inference and better reliability.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

*Lin Guo,Xiaoqing Luo,Wei Xie,Zhancheng Zhang,Hui Li,Rui Wang,Zhenhua Feng,Xiaoning Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HCLFuse, a novel infrared and visible image fusion method inspired by human cognitive principles, targeting improved structural consistency and detail quality through advanced generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance modal information in infrared and visible image fusion, face limitations in generative capabilities, and lack interpretability in complex scenarios.

Method: The method involves a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder for information decomposition and integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with physical guidance to improve perception of structural data and reduce dependency on data quality.

Result: HCLFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple datasets with notable improvement in semantic segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances fusion reliability and consistency by leveraging human cognitive inspiration and advanced generative techniques.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study examined the complementarity of CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) for periocular verification using the UBIPr database. Fusion of all three networks achieved state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of periocular verification systems by leveraging the complementarity of different CNN architectures.

Method: The researchers trained three CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) on VGGFace2 eye crops, evaluated metrics like cosine and chi-squared, used logistic regression for score fusion, and analyzed CNN attention with LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: ResNet50 consistently demonstrated superior individual performance, but combining all three networks via score-level fusion achieved significant improvements, setting a new state-of-the-art on the UBIPr database.

Conclusion: The distinct attention patterns of the three networks contribute to their complementarity, demonstrating that combining different CNNs can substantially boost periocular verification performance.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATG, a planning framework that addresses mode collapse and integrates safety constraints for more effective autonomous driving trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in imitation learning methods suffering from mode collapse and generative approaches lacking direct incorporation of safety and physical constraints.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called CATG that uses Constrained Flow Matching, explicitly modeling flow matching to mitigate mode collapse, incorporate safety constraints, and allowing trajectory manipulation through aggressiveness parameterization.

Result: CATG was tested on NavSim v2 challenge and secured 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31, also winning the Innovation Award.

Conclusion: CATG effectively mitigates limitations of existing methods, ensuring safe and diverse trajectory generation with controllable styles for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: This paper explores periocular biometrics using three CNN architectures and achieves the lowest Equal Error Rates reported on the UFPR-Periocular database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the effectiveness of CNN architectures for periocular recognition while overcoming limitations of small-scale datasets.

Method: Three CNN architectures were trained on over 1.9 million ocular crops from the VGGFace2 dataset and evaluated on the VGGFace2-Pose subset and UFPR-Periocular database.

Result: The EERs range from 9-15% for VGGFace2-Pose images and achieve 1-2% for UFPR-Periocular images, outperforming previous benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality datasets and controlled acquisition protocols significantly improve the performance of periocular recognition systems.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Method: The paper introduces AEOS-Bench with 3,907 satellite assets and 16,410 scenarios for realistic satellite behavior simulations and develops AEOS-Former, incorporating constraint-aware attention and iterative learning.

Result: AEOS-Former outperformed baseline models in task completion and energy efficiency through experiments, with ablation studies validating its design components.

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench provides a robust benchmark for constellation scheduling studies while AEOS-Former offers an efficient, adaptable solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining CNN and ViT backbones using evidential fusion for improved diabetic retinopathy grading, showing enhanced accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss, and existing automated diagnosis systems using CNN or ViT face performance bottlenecks. Integrating different backbone types can leverage their strengths for better detection and grading.

Method: The proposed approach fuses features from CNN and ViT backbones using a theory of evidence-based evidential fusion paradigm. Supporting evidence is generated via deep evidential networks, allowing adaptive fusion and improved decision-making.

Result: The hybrid model was tested on two diabetic retinopathy grading datasets, achieving improved grading accuracy and demonstrating strong interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The evidential fusion approach successfully integrates CNN and ViT features to overcome performance bottlenecks, offering both accurate grading and interpretability for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [144] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes GLYPH-SR, a diffusion framework for image super-resolution (SR), which enhances scene-text readability and visual realism simultaneously in challenging real-world scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current super-resolution methods do not adequately address character-level errors in scene-text, treating it as generic texture and failing in practical deployments where both readability and perceptual quality are required.

Method: The authors present a vision-language-guided diffusion framework, GLYPH-SR, incorporating a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet (TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler alternating between text- and scene-centric guidance.

Result: GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 scores by up to +15.18 percentage points (SVT x8, OpenOCR baseline) and maintains competitive perceptual quality metrics such as MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR effectively prioritizes both text legibility and perceptual quality in super-resolution tasks, enabling practical applications in vision systems requiring detailed scene-text readability along with high visual realism.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a dual-conditioning method integrating EEG embeddings and spatial saliency maps to improve fidelity and semantic accuracy in EEG-driven image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods lack spatial attention mechanisms, leading to limitations in image fidelity and semantic coherence.

Method: The study introduces a dual-conditioning framework using Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction, fine-tuning Stable Diffusion via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and incorporating a ControlNet branch for saliency-driven spatial control.

Result: Evaluation on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrates significant improvements in reconstructing low- and high-level image features while strongly aligning with human visual attention.

Conclusion: The research showcases that attentional priors enhance EEG decoding and image reconstruction quality, offering potential applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive systems.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

### [146] [Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614)
*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spiking Patches, a tokenization method for event cameras, preserving their asynchronous and spatially sparse characteristics while achieving faster inference times and comparable or superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for event camera data representation that retains its unique asynchronous and spatially sparse properties. Traditional methods like frames and voxels compromise these properties while achieving high accuracy.

Method: The authors develop Spiking Patches, a tokenization approach specifically designed for event cameras, and evaluate it using gesture recognition and object detection tasks with models like GNN, PCN, and Transformer.

Result: Spiking Patches outperforms voxel-based tokens and frames in terms of inference speed (up to 3.4x and 10.4x faster, respectively) while achieving comparable or higher accuracy, with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and 1.4 for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization through Spiking Patches offers a novel approach in event-based vision, preserving event camera properties and providing a promising direction for efficient and accurate event representation.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate long-form video generation (LVG) under complex prompts. It introduces realistic metrics addressing qualities like narrative coherence and thematic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty in evaluating long-form text-to-video outputs, especially complex prompts requiring fine-grained evaluation and abstract-level consistency, elements missed in existing benchmarks.

Method: LoCoT2V-Bench introduces realistic prompts with elements such as scene transitions and event dynamics, paired with multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks including new metrics like HERD for abstract attributes.

Result: Nine representative LVG models were evaluated, revealing that current methods excel in visual and temporal aspects but struggle with fine-grained and high-level thematic alignment.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench enables reliable evaluation of long-form complex text-to-video models and identifies critical areas for improving future generation techniques.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [148] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-TPT, a method to improve the test-time calibration of large vision-language models (VLMs) by maximizing angular diversity among textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT) techniques struggle with suboptimal calibration as they lack sufficient angular diversity in textual features, which challenges the safety and reliability of VLMs.

Method: The proposed A-TPT framework maximizes the minimum pairwise angular distance between textual features using learnable prompts to ensure uniformity on the unit hypersphere.

Result: A-TPT achieves better calibration (lower errors) and comparable accuracy than existing TPT methods. It shows robust performance on natural distribution shifts and medical datasets while offering solid theoretical underpinnings.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity improves test-time prompt tuning, enhancing VLMs' calibration, trustworthiness, and adaptability to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses adapting foundational 3D reconstruction models for point tracking in 3D, achieving competitive results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance point tracking capabilities using 3D grounded correspondence from modern reconstruction techniques.

Method: They fine-tune MASt3R with dynamic and static correspondences, combining reconstruction loss with training for dynamic point tracking, using synthetic data.

Result: Competitive or superior results in point tracking across multiple datasets compared to baseline models (e.g., CoTracker2, CoTracker3).

Conclusion: The approach proves effective for 3D point tracking, showcasing strong performance on benchmarks with limited data and dynamic/static correspondence integration.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [150] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in few-shot anomaly detection by improving semantic alignment between textual descriptions and visual anomalies using a novel framework, FineGrainedAD, and generating fine-grained captions with the proposed MFSC method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods struggle with semantic misalignment due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions for visual anomalies, limiting their anomaly localization performance.

Method: The authors introduce Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to create detailed captions for anomaly detection and propose the FineGrainedAD framework. FineGrainedAD includes Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) for better alignment and region localization.

Result: The proposed FineGrainedAD achieves superior anomaly localization performance on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD and MFSC significantly enhance the semantic alignment between text and visual data, leading to improved anomaly detection capabilities in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses context-related biases in vision-language models by using a causal inference-inspired approach at the representation level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with biases caused by familiar object-context co-occurrences, leading to reduced reliability in zero-shot scenarios when contexts differ.

Method: The paper uses counterfactual embeddings that recombine object features with alternative contexts, leveraging external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived contexts. It applies causal tools like Total Direct Effect estimation and activation subtraction.

Result: The method improves worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks without requiring model retraining or prompt design.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel way to improve zero-shot multimodal reasoning and performance by addressing context biases through lightweight counterfactual representations.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the self-improvement challenge in large vision-language models (LVLMs), focusing on re-balancing model optimization for simple and complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address an imbalance in reasoning optimization during self-improvement of LVLMs, where models prioritize simple tasks (head data) at the expense of complex reasoning tasks (tail data), leading to reduced performance over iterations.

Method: The authors propose four efficient strategies to counteract the imbalance, focusing on distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling during self-improvement processes.

Result: The proposed strategies lead to consistent improvements in visual reasoning tasks, achieving a 3.86-point average performance increase over the standard self-improvement methods.

Conclusion: Re-balancing optimization between simple and complex tasks in LVLM self-improvement is critical for overcoming performance bottlenecks and enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Result: Substantial detection improvements (12.4%-88.6%) across datasets, real-time inference speeds (30-47 FPS), and systematic ablation confirming optimal configurations.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance on civil engineering datasets (<10K images), balancing improved detection and computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptable edge detection method combining two-dimensional cellular automaton, meta-heuristics, and transfer learning, and evaluates its performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome weaknesses in traditional edge detectors, such as difficulty in detecting loose edges and lack of contextual awareness, by creating an adaptable detector for more robust edge detection in natural and specialized image sets.

Method: An adaptable detector was designed using two-dimensional cellular automaton optimized with meta-heuristics and combined with transfer learning techniques. The paper evaluated the impact of expanding the search space during the optimization phase and tested the adaptability and effectiveness of the model.

Result: The study revealed that expanding the search space during optimization was ineffective for the selected image set. Moreover, the model successfully adapted to input images but transfer learning did not provide notable improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses adaptability issues in edge detection, but extending the search space did not improve results, and applying transfer learning techniques had limited impact.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new model called SA$^{2}$Net, aimed at improving spine segmentation in ultrasound volume projection imaging for scoliosis diagnosis. It achieves better performance through advanced context understanding and structural awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in spine segmentation, such as limited learning of global contextual knowledge and the inability to incorporate rich structural information about spine shapes and positions.

Method: The proposed SA$^{2}$Net uses a scale-adaptive complementary strategy for capturing cross-dimensional correlations and a structure-affinity transformation that leverages semantic-specific affinities in a Transformer decoder for improved structure-aware reasoning. Additionally, a feature mixing loss aggregation method strengthens training.

Result: Experiments show that SA$^{2}$Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spine segmentation and adapts well to various backbones.

Conclusion: SA$^{2}$Net is a promising tool for intelligent spinal image analysis and advanced scoliosis diagnosis, combining novel deep learning mechanisms for robust and accurate spine segmentation.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework for creating shorter video advertisements through a two-stream audio-visual fusion model, outperforming existing summarization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of manually editing long video advertisements into shorter versions.

Method: The paper proposes a novel approach using video summarization techniques, framing video clipping as a shot selection problem. Critical emphasis is on the role of audio using a two-stream audio-visual fusion model.

Result: A new dataset called AdSum204 is introduced, and the proposed model significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: Automated frame importance prediction tailored for ads can efficiently create shorter ad versions, reducing manual intervention and improving precision.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework combining vision transformers and language models for zero-shot scene understanding in real-world situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI applications struggle with scene understanding in unfamiliar and dynamic environments due to the lack of labeled data and weak generalization capabilities of conventional models.

Method: The framework relies on the integration of pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual data with language, supplemented by a dynamic reasoning module that utilizes global and object-level context guided by linguistic cues.

Result: Experiments show up to 18% improvement in accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks like COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images in challenging and unseen settings, with strong performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and effective approach for zero-shot scene reasoning, enhancing generalizability in real-world environments.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recent advances in VQA models struggle with generalization in out-of-domain scenarios like remote sensing, medical imaging, and math diagrams. The proposed CATCH framework uses lightweight modules for cross-domain visual and linguistic adaptation without retraining the backbone model and achieves superior performance in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of generalization and domain adaptation in Visual Question Answering models when applied to out-of-domain scenarios like remote sensing, medical imaging, and math diagrams.

Method: The CATCH framework is introduced, utilizing a plug-and-play approach. It comprises a domain classifier for input image type identification and dual adapters (Prompt Adapter for language modulation and Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment), which are integrated via a unified hook interface without backbone model retraining.

Result: CATCH improves generalization in multiple VQA domains, achieving performance boosts such as +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA, demonstrating scalability and extensibility.

Conclusion: CATCH is a practical cross-domain adaptation framework for Visual Question Answering models, enhancing their generalization across diverse tasks while requiring minimal changes and no retraining, making it scalable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 demonstrates strong multimodal capabilities and computational efficiency, making it a valuable open-source tool for research in vision-language modeling and generation.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ResMatching, a novel computational super-resolution (CSR) method utilizing guided conditional flow matching to enhance fluorescence microscopy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the ill-posed problem of CSR by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to extrapolate frequencies and create higher-quality reconstructed images.

Method: ResMatching employs guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors, enabling effective reconstruction even in noisy, low-resolution scenarios.

Result: ResMatching demonstrates competitive performance across diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset, outperforming 7 baseline methods in balancing data fidelity and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: ResMatching provides robust results, especially under challenging conditions, and offers pixel-wise uncertainty estimates, aiding future users in rejecting uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Result: CYPRESS outperformed existing yield prediction models and showcased the advantages of fine-tuning foundation models for agriculture applications.

Conclusion: CYPRESS proves a novel, effective approach for high-resolution crop yield prediction, bridging Earth observation data and precision farming.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for

into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Result: The paper delivers insights into AV sensor capabilities and limitations, structured categorization of datasets, evaluation of modern detection methodologies, and identification of trends towards newer AI-driven approaches.

Conclusion: The survey provides a roadmap for current capabilities, challenges, and future opportunities in object detection technologies for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the application of deep learning-based optical flow models for estimating sea ice drift from satellite imagery, achieving sub-kilometer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of sea ice drift estimation, which is vital for Arctic navigation, climate research, and forecasting, by exploring the potential of advanced deep learning-based optical flow techniques.

Method: The paper benchmarks 48 deep learning optical flow models using RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR imagery and evaluates their performance based on endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS buoy data.

Result: The deep learning models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy, with errors of 300-400 meters, while consistently capturing regional sea ice drift patterns better than classical methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based optical flow methods provide accurate and spatially continuous motion estimates, making them valuable for polar remote sensing, navigation, and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

TL;DR: The paper addresses object recognition challenges caused by occlusions by introducing two scene-based information fusion techniques into existing RPN-DCNN networks. Experiments show improved recall and precision on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions significantly hinder object recognition algorithms, necessitating the exploration of additional sources of information, such as scene context, to improve accuracy.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: one selects an object network based on background scene prior to prediction; the other fuses scene knowledge after detection into object scores output by RPN.

Result: Both proposed methods show improved recall and precision against baseline methods on datasets with partial occlusions. Additionally, training on mixed occlusion scenarios outperforms other training approaches.

Conclusion: The paper offers interpretable methods to enhance object recognition robustness in occlusions, providing flexible solutions applicable to various datasets with potential for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a state-of-the-art framework for AMD lesion detection, ensuring better segmentation performance and sharing its source code for future research.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on chart grounding tasks, providing insights into their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing VLMs, which struggle with detailed perception and fine-grained chart analysis, highlighting the need for improved evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The authors created the ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB), using a JSON template and a two-stage inference workflow to assess VLMs on tasks like data extraction, visualization localization, attribute recognition, and chart comparison.

Result: The benchmark evaluations reveal biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in recent VLMs, offering insights into their abilities with fine-grained chart tasks.

Conclusion: The analysis emphasizes discrepancies in VLMs’ chart understanding and identifies areas requiring improvement to enhance their abilities in detailed chart interpretation.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a general hierarchical motion modeling method that infers structured motion relationships from data using graph-based hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion modeling methods rely on manual or heuristic hierarchies, which limits their adaptability and generalizability across different tasks.

Method: The proposed method uses graph-based hierarchies to decompose global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local residuals. Hierarchy inference is achieved through differentiable graph learning with graph neural networks.

Result: Experiments on 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation show the method reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchies and creates more realistic deformations compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The method provides a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, enabling general and interpretable motion models suitable for various motion-related tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show

### [172] [The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794)
*Jing Lin,Ruisi Wang,Junzhe Lu,Ziqi Huang,Guorui Song,Ailing Zeng,Xian Liu,Chen Wei,Wanqi Yin,Qingping Sun,Zhongang Cai,Lei Yang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper aims to improve 3D human motion generation (MoGen) by transferring insights from video generation (ViGen). It introduces new datasets, models, and benchmarks to enhance generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human motion generation models face limitations in generalization, whereas video generation models demonstrate strong generalization in modeling human behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large dataset integrating MoCap data and ViGen samples, propose ViMoGen (a diffusion transformer model), and create MBench for detailed evaluation.

Result: ViMoGen significantly improves over existing MoGen approaches in terms of motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization as validated by both automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel framework leveraging insights from video generation to advance 3D human motion generation, addressing fundamental bottlenecks and contributing resources for broader adoption and assessment.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

*Philipp Lindenberger,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Jan Hosang,Matteo Balice,Marc Pollefeys,Simon Lynen,Eduard Trulls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles global-scale precise image geographic localization, introducing a model for robust fine-grained geo-localization leveraging proxy tasks and hybrid techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image localization methods are limited due to inefficiencies, insufficient coverage, or coarse results across large areas.

Method: The approach combines proxy classification tasks to learn feature representations and integrate aerial embeddings into a hybrid model, enabling location retrieval at the continental scale.

Result: The system achieved localization within 200m for over 68% of queries covering a large European dataset, showcasing effective geo-localization capabilities.

Conclusion: The hybrid model successfully resolves challenges in large-scale image geographic localization with high precision, offering scalability across significant geographic ranges.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

### [174] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEE4D, a pose-free method for generating spatiotemporal 4D content from casual videos, without the need for manual 3D supervision or camera pose annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating 4D content from videos often require costly manual camera pose annotations, which are difficult to obtain for in-the-wild footage. This creates a barrier for practical applications.

Method: SEE4D replaces manual camera pose annotations with a framework that eliminates explicit trajectory prediction. It uses a view-conditional video inpainting model trained to learn a robust geometry prior by warping images to fixed virtual cameras and filling in missing details. This enables spatiotemporal autoregressive inference with bounded complexity.

Result: SEE4D outperforms pose- and trajectory-conditioned baselines in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments for cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEE4D successfully advances 4D content generation, offering a practical method for creating immersive 4D experiences from casual, unstructured videos, while being more robust and efficient than traditional methods.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [175] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique called masked diffusion captioning (MDC) to learn visual features by reconstructing captions from masked tokens conditioned on image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual feature learning using captioning models, and to reduce dependencies on auxiliary objectives inherent in autoregressive models.

Method: The authors condition a masked diffusion language model on visual features and train it to reconstruct masked text tokens from image-caption pairs.

Result: The visual features learned through MDC are competitive when tested with linear probing across models and datasets, compared to autoregressive and contrastive methods.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion captioning provides a strong visual signal and learns visual features effectively, showing its potential as an alternative to traditional captioning approaches.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents OmniX, a framework leveraging 2D generative models and panoramic vision tasks to generate high-quality, graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for PBR, relighting, and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generation of 3D scenes using 2D lifting techniques, particularly for creating graphics-ready environments with intrinsic properties such as PBR materials.

Method: The paper introduces OmniX, a unified framework using a lightweight cross-modal adapter structure to repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception, generation, and completion. It applies these models to a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates effective panoramic visual perception and generation of realistic 3D scenes, supported by experiments showcasing its success in graphics-ready scene generation.

Conclusion: OmniX represents a substantial advancement in leveraging 2D generative models for 3D scene construction, enabling immersive and physically realistic virtual worlds, and broadening applications in simulation and rendering.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates video generation models, specifically Veo-3, on their reasoning capabilities and identifies areas of strength and limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current video models, which exhibit realistic synthesis and certain reasoning behaviors, can serve as zero-shot reasoners in complex visual reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic empirical evaluation of Veo-3 across 12 reasoning dimensions, proposing the MME-CoF benchmark to standardize assessment of reasoning in video models.

Result: Veo-3 shows competence in short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and consistent dynamics but struggles with long-horizon causal reasoning, geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Though current video models are not yet reliable standalone zero-shot reasoners, they show potential as supplementary tools in combination with dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Zixu Shen,Kexin Chu,Yifan Zhang,Dawei Xiang,Runxin Wu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ExpertFlow enhances large language model efficiency under constrained GPU memory by combining adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing for MoE architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are limited by GPU memory constraints, and conventional MoE inference approaches cause latency and inefficiency.

Method: ExpertFlow proposes an adaptive runtime system integrating expert prefetching and a hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme to optimize MoE inference.

Result: ExpertFlow reduces model stall time to under 0.1%, demonstrating effective optimization for MoE inference despite stringent memory limits.

Conclusion: ExpertFlow significantly mitigates memory and latency issues, enabling efficient inference for large-scale models in constrained environments.

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

TL;DR: This paper reviews Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), exploring their theoretical foundations, architectural variants, practical strategies, and implementation tools. It highlights the enhanced expressivity and parameter efficiency of KANs compared to traditional MLPs, surveys basis function options, and provides recommendations and research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a systematic synthesis of the rapidly growing developments and ecosystem surrounding Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), emphasizing their advantages over standard MLPs.

Method: Through an extensive theoretical and empirical review, the paper categorizes advancements in KANs, surveys basis functions, studies their trade-offs, and compiles open-source implementations alongside analyzing practical techniques.

Result: The paper demonstrates the flexibility and superior parameter efficiency of KANs versus MLPs, presenting a roadmap of advancements and techniques while offering criticism and suggestions for choosing appropriate architectures.

Conclusion: This review contributes to understanding KANs by identifying gaps, presenting a guide for selecting architectures, and creating a structured resource to support further research and development in the domain.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The

TL;DR: This paper proposes HiMAE, a framework for multi-resolution representation learning from wearable sensors, outperforming traditional models while enabling efficient edge inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the predictive utility of physiological time series data from wearable sensors and hypothesizes that temporal resolution plays a fundamental role in representation learning.

Method: The introduced HiMAE framework combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder-decoder, enabling multi-resolution embeddings for interpretability and optimizing temporal scale analysis.

Result: HiMAE outperforms state-of-the-art models across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks while operating efficiently on compact devices, such as smartwatches.

Conclusion: HiMAE serves as an effective self-supervised learner capable of discovering scale-sensitive patterns in wearable health data, while also being lightweight for edge inference.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: The discovery of high-energy materials crucial for propulsion and defense is hindered by limited experimental data and testing facilities. The paper aims to overcome these challenges by exploring computational methods.

Method: The authors employ LSTM networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks for property predictions, integrating a novel embedding space strategy using fixed SHA-256 embeddings and partially trainable representations.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 67.5% validity, 37.5% novelty in molecule generation, and identified 37 new super explosives with predicted detonation velocities exceeding 9 km/s. It generated a library with high diversity (mean Tanimoto coefficient: 0.214).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential in advancing the design and discovery of high-energy materials, enabling the generation of diverse and novel chemical structures, important for propulsion and defense applications.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the learning mechanisms of chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision in transformers, finding CoT improves performance depending on task complexity, with transient unfaithful reasoning traces during training and effects on internal computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand how chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision helps transformers improve performance, particularly by exploring its learning dynamics and applicability to different task complexities.

Method: The authors trained transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable complexities, analyzing two settings: producing only final answers and emitting CoT traces. They quantified learning dynamics using a three-parameter logistic curve and investigated the impact of CoT supervision on learning and internal computation.

Result: The study found that CoT improves learning speed and task generalization but is limited in highly complex tasks. It also revealed transient unfaithful traces in early training and showed CoT affects transformers' inner computations.

Conclusion: CoT supervision enhances transformers' generalization and reasoning capabilities but is task complexity-dependent. It alters learning dynamics and computation but requires further exploration for complex tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves reinforcement learning (RL) training for large language models (LLMs) by introducing ReSpec, combining speculative decoding (SD) with RL mechanisms for up to 4.5x speedup and better stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition of LLMs through RL is slow due to generation time consuming over 75% of training time. Traditional speculative decoding is promising in serving systems but remains unoptimized for RL.

Method: The authors propose ReSpec, a system leveraging three approaches: dynamically tuning speculative decoding configurations, updating the drafter through knowledge distillation, and weighting updates via rollout rewards.

Result: ReSpec enables up to 4.5x speedup in RL adaptation with reward convergence and stable training on Qwen models (3B–14B).

Conclusion: ReSpec offers an effective framework for improving efficiency and stability in adapting LLMs with reinforcement learning, making RL-based LLM adaptation more practical.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework and the ABLOC algorithm to assess and address systematic biases in multi-agent systems, determining when bias learning is practical and how it can improve system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic biases in multi-agent systems can impair performance across various fields, and existing methods are either ineffective or impractical. The authors aim to understand when learning and correcting for these biases are feasible and beneficial.

Method: The authors propose a concept called the 'learnability ratio' to quantify the predictability of bias variance from observable data. They introduce the ABLOC algorithm, which learns bias-correcting transformations and optimizes combination weights, backed by theoretical bounds.

Result: The study finds that systems with high learnability ratios can recover significant performance improvements (40%-70% of theoretical maximum), while those with low learnability ratios show minimal gains.

Conclusion: The paper provides a diagnostic framework and algorithm for assessing and correcting biases in multi-agent systems, offering guidance on when bias learning is worth pursuing in practical applications.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses ride-pooling's limitations in myopic decision-making by introducing a reinforcement learning framework coupled with a ride-pooling simulation for non-myopic strategies, which significantly improve operational metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies caused by myopic decision-making in ride-pooling, which limits its potential to reduce costs, congestion, and environmental impacts.

Method: The approach employs a simulation-informed reinforcement learning framework, including n-step temporal difference learning, to enhance non-myopic decision-making and incorporates a rebalancing policy for idle vehicles.

Result: The proposed framework improves the service rate by 8.4%, reduces passenger wait and in-vehicle times, cuts fleet size by 25%, and boosts service performance through added rebalancing policies at the cost of higher vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Conclusion: The non-myopic reinforcement learning approach with integrated rebalancing offers significant benefits in service efficiency, passenger experience, and operational costs for ride-pooling systems.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC-Top-$K$, a gradient sparsification method for distributed machine learning, achieving efficient communication and faster training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient compression methods either discard important structural information or incur high communication costs in distributed machine learning.

Method: ARC-Top-$K$ aligns sparsity patterns using lightweight gradient sketches, enabling efficient All-Reduce communication while retaining globally significant information.

Result: ARC-Top-$K$ demonstrates faster convergence rates, linear speedup, and reduces training time by up to 60.7% compared to Top-$K$.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-$K$ offers an efficient and robust solution for gradient sparsification, improving scalability and performance in distributed machine learning systems.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

*Darius Masoum Zadeh-Jousdani,Elvin Hajizada,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA) for efficient online learning in robotic systems. It reduces computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems need efficient online learning algorithms to continuously adapt to changing environments, but traditional methods like backpropagation are not biologically plausible or optimal for these scenarios.

Method: The authors developed PCN-TA, which preserves latent states across temporal frames to leverage temporal correlations, thereby reducing computational demands.

Result: PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline Predictive Coding networks.

Conclusion: PCN-TA improves computational efficiency and supports real-time adaptation in robotic systems, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware and edge deployment.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MemEIC, a method for continual and compositional knowledge editing in large vision-language models to address limitations in multimodal knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to continuously update large vision-language models to handle dynamic information and the shortcomings of editing methods focusing on isolated modalities.

Method: MemEIC uses external-internal editing with dual external memory, dual LoRA adapters, and a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional reasoning.

Result: MemEIC enhances performance on multimodal tasks, preserves previous edits, and sets benchmarks for continual knowledge editing in LVLMs.

Conclusion: MemEIC offers a robust approach for continuously updating LVLMs, effectively combining multimodal knowledge and advancing the field of multimodal knowledge refinement.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

### [189] [Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an improved over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) method for heterogeneous wireless systems by introducing a structured bias while reducing update variance, validated on non-convex learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTA-FL designs struggle with heterogeneous wireless conditions, leading to inefficiencies like inflated update variance and suboptimal performance, especially for non-convex AI models.

Method: The authors propose a structured, time-invariant model bias approach with reduced variance updates for non-convex objectives. They derive a stationarity bound to address the bias-variance trade-off and develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) power-control algorithm.

Result: Experiments on a non-convex image classification task show that the proposed SCA-based design improves convergence speed, optimizes the bias, and enhances generalization compared to existing OTA-FL solutions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel OTA-FL approach that effectively handles wireless heterogeneity and non-convexity challenges, advancing model performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Jialong Sun,Xinpeng Ling,Jiaxuan Zou,Jiawen Kang,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral bias in neural networks affects long-term time series predictions; a new algorithm called FreLE mitigates it and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral bias, where neural networks prefer fitting low-frequency signals over high-frequency ones, hinders accurate long-term time series prediction across many models.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical experiments measuring spectral bias in mainstream models and proposed FreLE, an algorithm with frequency loss enhancement as a plug-and-play loss function unit.

Result: The FreLE algorithm effectively mitigated spectral bias, improving model generalization and showing superior performance across various experiments.

Conclusion: Spectral bias is a universal characteristic of neural networks, and adopting FreLE successfully addresses it for enhanced prediction accuracy in time series models.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

### [191] [Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801)
*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPECS, a new cold start framework for reinforcement learning in multimodal models, improving generalization and performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning methods for cold start in multimodal reinforcement learning induce issues like overfitting and weak generalization.

Method: SPECS, a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework, decouples multimodal learning by generating self-distilled preference data and focusing on surface-form criteria during training.

Result: SPECS demonstrated consistent improvement in multimodal benchmarks, notably improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.

Conclusion: Decoupling learning via SPECS enhances generalization, reduces training instability, improves exploration, and raises performance ceilings in multimodal reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-POT, a sparse-activated model to tackle challenges of heterogeneity in PDE datasets and inference costs in pre-training neural operators. It utilizes dynamic expert selection and shared experts to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges caused by data scarcity, heterogeneous PDE datasets, and high inference costs in pre-training neural operators for solving PDE problems.

Method: The MoE-POT architecture employs a layer-wise router-gating network to dynamically select equation-specific routed experts and shared experts, leveraging sparse-activated modeling to capture specific and general features of PDE datasets.

Result: Pre-trained models achieve up to 40% error reduction compared to existing models with fewer activated parameters, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The MoE-POT architecture is effective in handling heterogeneous datasets, optimizing inference, and reducing errors, validated by interpretability analyses of its gating decisions.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

### [193] [PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25808)
*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO introduces a smarter way to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs using preimages from soft prompts to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs by leveraging the many-to-one mapping of soft prompts as a beneficial structure rather than a hindrance.

Method: PRESTO employs three key strategies: score sharing within preimage structure, preimage-informed initialization for search space coverage, and score consistency regularization to enforce prediction reliability within preimages.

Result: PRESTO provides 14 times more effective scored data, leading to efficient optimization under limited query budgets and surpassing traditional methods across 33 instruction optimization tasks.

Conclusion: By utilizing preimage structures, PRESTO significantly improves instruction optimization efficiency and performance for black-box LLMs, demonstrating its superiority through experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScaleDiff, an efficient, model-agnostic framework for enhancing resolution in pretrained diffusion models without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve image generation quality of text-to-image diffusion models beyond training resolution without requiring extra training.

Method: ScaleDiff uses Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA) for efficient self-attention, Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) for fine detail generation, and Structure Guidance for enhancing global structure.

Result: ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art image quality and faster inference across U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective and efficient solution for scaling up resolution in text-to-image diffusion models, compatible with varied architectures.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: The paper addresses causal effect estimation in multi-domain settings with unobserved confounders, providing methods for identifiability, estimation, and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating causal effects in scenarios with unobserved confounders that vary across domains.

Method: Proposes methodology leveraging a proxy variable of the hidden confounder for causal effect estimation; introduces two estimation techniques with proofs of identifiability, consistency, and derivation of confidence intervals.

Result: Demonstrates theoretical support through simulations and applies the methods to real-world data on website rankings' impact on consumer choices.

Conclusion: The presented methods effectively identify and estimate causal effects in complex multi-domain setups involving unobserved confounders.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedVLSynther, a framework for generating high-quality medical visual question-answering (VQA) data from open biomedical literature, which boosts accuracy across multiple medical VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the limitations in training general medical VQA models due to a lack of large, high-quality, and openly available datasets.

Method: A generator-verifier framework (MedVLSynther) was developed to synthesize multiple-choice VQA items from biomedical literature by analyzing figures, captions, and text references. A multi-stage verifier ensures quality by enforcing various evaluation criteria.

Result: The framework created MedSynVQA, a dataset of 13,087 audited medical questions over 14,803 images. Models trained using these data outperformed existing LMMs across six medical VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedVLSynther provides a scalable, reproducible, auditable approach to creating high-quality data for medical VQA training, contributing significantly to the field.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open-source framework, π_RL, designed to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robots by integrating reinforcement learning (RL), achieving notable performance improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for Vision-Language-Action models demands large data, which is laborious to collect. Reinforcement learning offers automation potential but faces challenges with flow-based models due to intractable action log-likelihoods.

Method: The work proposes π_RL, an RL framework for training flow-based VLAs in simulation. It introduces two RL algorithms: Flow-Noise, modeling denoising as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network, and Flow-SDE, combining agent-environment interaction with efficient exploration using SDE conversion.

Result: π_RL achieves significant success in boosting VLA task performance. It improves few-shot SFT models (π_0 and π_0.5) on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks, with performance gains from 57.6% to 97.6% and 77.1% to 98.3% on LIBERO, and from 41.6% to 85.7% and 40.0% to 84.8% on ManiSkill, respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that π_RL enhances the scalability and performance of flow-based VLAs by effectively applying RL techniques, showing promise in multitask and heterogeneous simulation settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the InfoNCE objective's use as an MI estimator and proposes the InfoNCE-anchor method for more accurate MI estimation, while finding structured density ratios are more important for representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to evaluate and enhance the accuracy of mutual information (MI) estimation methods, especially for contrastive representation learning tasks as MI estimation yields indirect results.

Method: The authors propose the InfoNCE-anchor modification introducing an auxiliary anchor class for consistent density ratio estimation. They generalize the framework using proper scoring rules to unify contrastive objectives like InfoNCE, NCE, and $f$-divergence methods.

Result: The InfoNCE-anchor method demonstrates significantly reduced bias and provides accurate MI estimation. Despite this accuracy, it does not improve performance in downstream self-supervised learning tasks.

Conclusion: Accurate MI estimation is less critical for contrastive representation learning's success; structured density ratios are more impactful for task performance.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

TL;DR: A novel graph-topological active learning method is proposed, leveraging Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) for both exploration and exploitation phases, with improvements in label propagation and performance on low-label-rate classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exploration versus exploitation challenge in active learning under limited label budgets using graph-based techniques.

Method: Uses Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) for labeling strategies and introduces a graph rewiring technique to improve label propagation and preserve sparsity.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperformed graph-based semi-supervised baselines in benchmark classification tasks with low label rates.

Conclusion: The graph-topological approach using BFC offers effective active learning routines and enhances classification performance under scarce labeling conditions.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

### [200] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the implicit bias of incremental Adam optimizer and compares it to full-batch Adam. It finds that incremental Adam can deviate from full-batch behavior, converging to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier under certain data structures. Meanwhile, Signum optimizer's bias remains consistent across batching schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the implicit bias of Adam optimizer, which is widely used in deep learning, as its theoretical properties are not fully comprehended and show differences depending on batching schemes.

Method: The study analyzes incremental Adam for logistic regression on linearly separable data. It constructs structured datasets and develops a proxy algorithm to evaluate the optimizer's convergence behavior under varying conditions.

Result: Incremental Adam converges to a different geometry ($\ell_2$-max-margin) than full-batch Adam ($\ell_\infty$-max-margin) for particular datasets. Signum shows consistent behavior across batch sizes, retaining $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias.

Conclusion: Adam's implicit bias is heavily dependent on batching and dataset structure, while Signum maintains invariance in its convergence, stressing optimizer choice's crucial role in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

### [201] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of sampling from posterior distributions under noisy linear measurements using an innovative combination of diffusion models and annealed Langevin dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational intractability of posterior sampling for tasks such as image inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, prioritizing the context of log-concave distributions where existing methods have limitations.

Method: The authors propose utilizing diffusion models along with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics to enable conditional sampling, which relaxes the strict error requirements seen in traditional Langevin dynamics.

Result: With the proposed method, conditional sampling is achieved in polynomial time using a relaxed $L^4$ bound on the score error, demonstrating improved robustness compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The authors successfully show that their framework simplifies conditional posterior sampling tasks while reducing sensitivity to score estimation errors, providing practical implications for tasks involving log-concave distributions.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

### [202] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves active learning for uncurated data pools by proposing task-driven representations updated during the process, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active learning methods rely on static unsupervised representations, which fail to capture important task-relevant information in messy data pools.

Method: The authors propose task-driven representations updated periodically during active learning using previously collected labels. Two strategies are introduced: one based on semi-supervised learning and the other using supervised fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation.

Result: The proposed methods, based on task-updated representations, significantly outperform approaches using unsupervised or pretrained representations.

Conclusion: Task-driven, updated representations enhance active learning performance, especially for messy, uncurated data pools.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

### [203] [Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934)
*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvGNN-WM, a method to watermark GNNs based on their perception of graph invariants, ensuring ownership proof through a lightweight and reliable black-box verification mechanism without triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Watermarking of GNNs is necessary to protect valuable intellectual property. Existing methods relying on backdoor triggers are ineffective against common model modifications and create ambiguities in ownership claims.

Method: The authors propose InvGNN-WM, tying ownership to implicit perception of graph invariants. A head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity from an owner-private data set, while a decoder produces a binary watermark controlled by thresholds. The watermark is designed to be robust and imperceptible.

Result: The method achieves comparable accuracy to unaltered models while outperforming existing watermarking approaches in accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets. It resists pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization, though pure knowledge distillation reduces its effectiveness.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM offers a robust, trigger-free watermarking approach for GNNs with strong ownership guarantees while maintaining performance. It is resistant to most common model alterations and minimizes false-positive rates.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can help select machine learning models and hyperparameters using dataset metadata, with two prompting strategies: zero-shot and meta-informed modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce dependency on expert intuition and expensive automated search for choosing models and hyperparameters in machine learning.

Method: Two prompting strategies are investigated: zero-shot mode relying on pretrained LLM knowledge and meta-informed mode that incorporates past task examples.

Result: LLMs, using dataset metadata, can recommend competitive model families and hyperparameters without search while demonstrating their in-context meta-learning ability.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant promise as lightweight tools for efficient model and hyperparameter selection, leveraging their meta-learning capabilities.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT) for reversibly encoding high-cardinality categorical data into numerical vectors, showing comparable predictive results with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional hashing or one-hot encodings for categorical identifiers.

Method: MLT uses modular arithmetic over finite fields combined with invertible linear transformations, enabling control of dimensionality and scalability.

Result: MLT achieves similar predictive performance to supervised embeddings on MovieLens 20M dataset but with fewer parameters and lower training cost.

Conclusion: MLT provides an effective, scalable, and resource-efficient method for encoding categorical identifiers with an open-source implementation available.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GeoFMs' potential for improving health data predictions in LMICs and demonstrates modest predictive enhancement compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Routine health data in LMICs often suffer from delays and incomplete coverage. This paper aims to explore novel data sources and approaches to address these limitations.

Method: The study used XGBoost models and GeoFM embeddings from Google PDFM, Google AlphaEarth, and mobile CDR to predict 15 health outcomes in Malawi. Performance was assessed using R2 and cross-validation techniques.

Result: GeoFM embeddings outperformed traditional methods in 13 out of 15 health indicators tested. Combining multiple GeoFM sources achieved better predictive accuracy, especially for population density, HIV cases, and vaccinations.

Conclusion: Multi-source GeoFM integration enhances health data systems by better predicting certain health and demographic outcomes in LMICs, though challenges remain for data-poor indicators.

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

### [207] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcuts disrupt generalization in deep networks. This paper investigates how these shortcuts spread across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability of deep networks suffers due to shortcuts, and understanding their influence on feature representations has been limited.

Method: Counterfactual training design analyzes the impact of shortcuts on clean vs. skewed datasets across layers, architectures, and datasets.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed across the network. Shallow layers encode spurious features; deeper layers forget predictive core features.

Conclusion: Designing universal shortcut-mitigation methods is challenging; dataset- and architecture-specific strategies are better solutions.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews applications of neural networks for optimization without training data, exploring methods and distinctions from related concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven learning methods are still immature, and training data is often scarce, particularly in scientific domains like medical imaging.

Method: The paper analyzes neural network optimization methods in dataless settings, categorizing them as architecture-agnostic or architecture-specific.

Result: Promising applications across areas like combinatorial optimization and inverse problems are noted for dataless neural network use.

Conclusion: The dataless neural network framework can address limited-data scenarios, distinguishing itself from related concepts like zero-shot learning.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the budgeted deferral framework for training efficient deferral algorithms while reducing expert query costs, maintaining prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs of querying all experts during training for deferral algorithms and to achieve efficient expert usage.

Method: The authors propose novel algorithms for two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings, which selectively query a limited subset of experts for each training example. They provide theoretical guarantees such as generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly cut training costs and retain prediction accuracy across various domains.

Conclusion: The developed budget-aware deferral algorithms achieve effective training with reduced expert usage and hold practical value for minimizing resource costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores an alternative geometric perspective of parametric memory in sequence modeling, challenging the brute-force lookup approach of entity co-occurrences and highlighting the emergence of a spectral bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to rethink the dominant brute-force associative memory model in sequence modeling, proposing a geometric perspective to better explain how neural embeddings encode global relationships between entities.

Method: Analyzing transformer reasoning to showcase its compatibility with geometric memory encoding, isolating phenomena not explained by local co-occurrence associations, and connecting these findings with Node2Vec for spectral bias analysis.

Result: The study demonstrates that Transformer models synthesize geometric structures of memory, encoding global relationships across entities, even non-co-occurring ones, and attributes this to a natural spectral bias rather than conventional architectural pressures.

Conclusion: The geometric view of parametric memory provides a deeper understanding of neural embeddings and opens pathways to enhancing Transformer models' memory capabilities. This perspective also challenges existing intuitions in various domains such as knowledge acquisition and memory architecture design.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate differentiable optimization into learning, control, and decision-making systems while overcoming challenges like solver specialization and interface mismatches.

Method: The approach involves differentiating the KKT system for smooth potentially nonconvex programs and using a JuMP-native parameter-centric API for versatile derivative computation.

Result: The framework enables sensitivity computation, supports convex and nonconvex models, and demonstrates scalable impact in iterative methods and training optimization proxies.

Conclusion: DiffOpt.jl provides a streamlined tool for experimentation, learning, and design in differentiable optimization, compatible with standard modeling practices and solver ecosystems.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: The paper addresses infrequent exploration in linear bandits by proposing a practical framework, INFEX, combining exploratory and greedy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the impracticality of continuous exploration and the failure of purely greedy strategies in scenarios requiring safety, costs, and diversity.

Method: Introduced INFEX, a framework that alternates between exploratory policy execution and greedy actions based on a specific schedule.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows INFEX achieves regret performance comparable to standard algorithms with fewer exploratory intervals. Empirical evaluations validate runtime and regret improvement.

Conclusion: INFEX is a simple, modular, and efficient framework that bridges the gap between exploratory and greedy methods, benefiting both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in modeling patient heterogeneity and adapting risk predictions to individual and temporal dynamics in survival analysis.

Method: A dual-MoE framework with a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware learning and a hazard MoE leveraging patient features and time embeddings.

Result: Improved performance on breast cancer datasets (METABRIC and GBSG), boosting C-index by up to 0.04 and further gains when integrated with the Consurv framework.

Conclusion: The approach enhances survival analysis pipelines, effectively capturing patient and temporal dynamics for better predictions.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Result: The model's early layers aligned well with human concepts (up to 85% accuracy), but deeper layers diverged with only 50-65% accuracy. Chess960 revealed a 10-20% drop in concept recognition, underscoring reliance on patterns rather than abstract understanding.

Conclusion: AI systems optimize for performance at the expense of human-aligned conceptual understanding, creating a challenge for creative applications that require genuine collaboration between humans and AI.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

### [215] [Do Students Debias Like Teachers? On the Distillability of Bias Mitigation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26038)
*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation negatively impacts model debiasing capabilities, but solutions such as data augmentation, iterative KD, and weight initialization from teachers can mitigate these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how knowledge distillation affects robustness and debiasing capabilities of models in tasks like natural language inference and image classification.

Method: Extensive experiments analyzing the debiasing transferability and internal mechanisms post knowledge distillation.

Result: Key findings include loss of debiasing efficacy post-KD, stable robustness across model biases, and identification of specific internal model patterns causing this behavior.

Conclusion: Three solutions—data augmentation, iterative distillation, and model initialization—are recommended to improve distillability and enhance understanding of KD's impact on model robustness and debiasing.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

### [216] [Towards Scaling Laws for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26064)
*David Otte,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates scaling laws in symbolic regression (SR) using a deep learning-based end-to-end transformer pipeline, finding that SR performance improves predictably with increased compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how deep learning-based SR methods scale with compute and uncover principles for improving SR model training to gain scientific insights and create interpretable models for tabular data.

Method: The study uses a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline paired with carefully generated training data, analyzing the impact of compute across model sizes and hyperparameter scaling to identify trends and optimal training regimes.

Result: Results show that both validation loss and solved rate follow power-law trends with compute, and optimal batch size, learning rates, and token-to-parameter ratios are revealed for different compute scales.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that SR performance is predictable based on compute resources, providing a foundation for training efficient and scalable SR models using systematic scaling principles.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

### [217] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that optimizes the geometric structure of machine learning models by treating the model space as a dynamic manifold instead of using traditional parameter optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a machine learning paradigm that surpasses the limitations of traditional parameter optimization, enabling models to adapt their geometries to data.

Method: The method involves optimizing the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology using a variational framework. The manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh for computational efficiency, and optimization is facilitated through automatic differentiation.

Result: A novel machine learning framework inspired by differential geometry and the Einstein-Hilbert action is established. The method proves to offer higher expressive power and adaptability compared to fixed-geometry models.

Conclusion: This framework sets the stage for dynamic meta-learners capable of evolving both geometry and topology, highlighting its potential in scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

*James Meldrum,Basem Suleiman,Fethi Rabhi,Muhammad Johan Alibasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews 72 studies on synthetic financial data generation, discussing methodologies like GANs and VAEs, and highlights gaps in privacy safeguards and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and regulatory issues in working with sensitive financial data while maintaining its utility for machine learning using synthetic data.

Method: Systematic review of 72 studies published since 2018, categorizing financial information types, generative methods, and evaluation techniques.

Result: Findings show GANs are the most popular approach, especially for time-series and tabular data. However, there is a gap in rigorous privacy safeguard evaluations.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the potential for synthetic data in the financial sector, highlights research gaps, and underscores the need for enhanced privacy-preserving methods and evaluations.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

### [219] [Nirvana: A Specialized Generalist Model With Task-Aware Memory Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26083)
*Yuhua Jiang,Shuang Cheng,Yihao Liu,Ermo Hua,Che Jiang,Weigao Sun,Yu Cheng,Feifei Gao,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Nirvana, a Specialized Generalist Model with a task-focused memory mechanism that adapts dynamically and achieves competitive performance across general and specialized tasks, such as MRI reconstruction and reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language model (LLM) designs lack task-specific memory mechanisms, limiting their adaptability for achieving expert-level performance while retaining generalist capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes Nirvana, an SGM with the Task-Aware Memory Trigger and Specialized Memory Updater. These innovations dynamically adjust task-related parameters and the memory mechanism via a self-supervised fine-tuning approach.

Result: Nirvana outperforms traditional LLM architectures on both general and specialized tasks such as medical image reconstruction (MRI). It achieved superior task adaptation and higher-quality results while also maintaining strong generalist capabilities.

Conclusion: Nirvana's design enables LLMs to balance general capabilities with expert-level domain specialization through its dynamic memory mechanism, making it effective across diverse applications including challenging fields like medical imaging.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [220] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve bug bisection accuracy by over 38% compared to the state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bug bisection face limitations such as assuming that bug-inducing and patch commits modify the same functions, over-reliance on code changes while ignoring commit messages, and the use of basic heuristics without logical vulnerability analysis.

Method: The authors propose a multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to comprehensively process patch information, compare multiple candidate commits with context, and refine the list of candidates via sequential down-selection steps.

Result: The proposed method achieves over 38% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art and 60% improvement over a baseline LLM-based method.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs in a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches and significantly improves the performance and accuracy of bug bisection tasks.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [221] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Urban traffic congestion is addressed using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize vehicle routing, proposing Adaptive Navigation (AN) and Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN) models, which outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle urban traffic congestion caused by inefficient vehicle routing, particularly when using static algorithms in dynamic, multi-vehicle environments.

Method: The authors introduce Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model using Graph Attention Networks for routing, and Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), using a hub-based approach with CTDE and Attentive Q-Mixing for large networks.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real urban maps demonstrate that AN reduces travel time and achieves better routing success, while HHAN scales effectively to large networks and achieves significant improvements under heavy traffic.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the effectiveness of MARL-based methods for scalable and congestion-aware vehicle routing, offering solutions for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE introduces a framework to assess stratified performance of Earth-based forecasts, identifying disparities in prediction accuracy by regions, income levels, and landcover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to explore unequal model performance across different geospatial and socio-economic categories, rather than relying solely on average global metrics.

Method: The paper proposes SAFE, a package that stratifies forecast data into attributes such as territory, global subregions, income levels, and landcover, enabling analysis of model performance disparities across varied regions and attributes.

Result: Using SAFE, an evaluation of modern AI-based weather prediction models revealed significant disparities in forecasting accuracy across geographic and socio-economic strata.

Conclusion: Highlighting disparities in model accuracy, SAFE calls for improved fairness in forecasting models. The open-source availability of SAFE aims to promote transparency and further research in this area.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

*Chenming Tang,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach aimed at overcoming exploration stagnation in RLVR without external expert guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods face exploration stagnation due to reliance on initial LLM capabilities and lack external expert availability to address this limitation.

Method: The authors developed LTE, which leverages previously incorrect self-generated answers and addresses overlong responses to enhance training of LLMs without needing external expert guidance.

Result: LTE demonstrated superior performance compared to GRPO, with improvements of 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k across six mathematical benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base.

Conclusion: LTE successfully addresses exploration stagnation and improves both exploitation and exploration in LLM training, offering a scalable solution without external reliance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CorVS, a data-driven method for identifying workers in warehouses by correlating visual and sensor tracking, which addresses challenges in conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A need for reliable worker localization methods that utilize visual tracking and complement sensor data in real-world warehouse environments.

Method: CorVS combines a deep learning model to predict correspondence probabilities and reliability alongside an algorithm that matches visual and sensor data over time.

Result: CorVS effectiveness was demonstrated using a dataset from real warehouse operations, showing its practical applicability.

Conclusion: CorVS offers a practical solution for worker identification in logistics settings, enhancing performance in challenging industrial environments.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces maxVSTAR, a system that addresses domain shift challenges in CSI-based human activity recognition by employing a vision-guided adaptive retraining framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle domain shift issues in WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition, which cause performance deterioration under varying environments and hardware.

Method: maxVSTAR uses a closed-loop, vision-guided model with a YOLO-based vision model providing dynamic activity labels for creating a teacher-student architecture. These labels enable continuous fine-tuning of the CSI-based HAR model (STAR) directly at the edge.

Result: maxVSTAR achieved a significant accuracy improvement (from 49.14% to 81.51% after adaptation) on uncalibrated hardware, demonstrating effective domain shift mitigation.

Conclusion: The study reveals the feasibility of long-term autonomous HAR in IoT environments through dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation, offering a scalable solution for edge-deployed systems.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human activity recognition (HAR) methods via Wi-Fi CSI face challenges such as computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited feasibility in resource-constrained environments, prompting the need for a robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient system.

Method: This paper introduces STAR, an edge-AI optimized framework using a lightweight GRU-based neural network (33% fewer parameters than traditional LSTMs), adaptive preprocessing techniques for CSI data, and a hardware-aware co-optimization approach.

Conclusion: STAR is a scalable, energy-efficient, and privacy-preserving HAR solution, offering sub-second response latency and high accuracy, making it suitable for smart homes, healthcare, and mobile IoT applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart

This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an

real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an

achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge enhances molecule-text learning by introducing substructure-aware alignment and refinement mechanisms, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to capture fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.

Method: MolBridge introduces augmented alignments with substructure-aware contrastive learning and a self-refinement mechanism.

Result: MolBridge demonstrates improved fine-grained correspondences and achieves superior performance across molecular benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignment significantly advances molecule-text learning, proven effective by MolBridge’s results.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text

TL;DR: This paper evaluates complex methods for anomaly detection in steam turbine systems, concluding simpler models (Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble) perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective strategy for anomaly detection in multivariate industrial time series with imbalanced data.

Method: Test advanced feature engineering, hybrid model architectures, and a simpler Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble on anomaly detection tasks.

Result: The Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble outperformed complex approaches, achieving AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time window.

Conclusion: Complex strategies underperformed, proving that simpler models combined with data segmentation excel in robustness and operational utility for imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

### [229] [A Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Collaborative Public Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26184)
*Songxin Lei,Qiongyan Wang,Yanchen Zhu,Hanyu Yao,Sijie Ruan,Weilin Ruan,Yuyu Luo,Huaming Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA) problem and a novel Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) framework for addressing it, achieving superior performance through evaluation on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies in existing public resource allocation methods, which optimize resources independently without considering capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.

Method: A new problem, CPRA, is formulated as a potential game, and a GSTRL framework is introduced to approximate Nash equilibrium while capturing spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the GSTRL framework demonstrates superior performance in solving the CPRA problem.

Conclusion: The authors establish a strong theoretical foundation for CPRA and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the GSTRL framework, contributing significantly to public resource allocation optimization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

### [230] [Accumulative SGD Influence Estimation for Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26185)
*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware method to estimate per-sample influence in AI, improving accuracy over existing SGD-IE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current influence estimation methods, like SGD-IE, fail to account for compounding effects across epochs, which leads to misranking critical samples in modern data-centric AI.

Method: ACC-SGD-IE introduces an accumulative influence state updated at each step during training, propagating the leave-one-out perturbation across epochs.

Result: ACC-SGD-IE provides more accurate influence estimates, especially for long epochs, and performs better on data cleansing tasks in both convex and non-convex training scenarios.

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE is a significant improvement in influence estimation methods for AI, yielding enhanced data cleansing and superior model performance.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

*Avinash Kadimisetty,Arun Rajagopalan,Vijendra SK*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study utilizes machine learning models to predict hospital readmissions, highlighting Random Forest as the best-performing model through analysis of patient health data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospital readmissions significantly impact healthcare costs and quality, thus reducing preventable readmissions is crucial for improving health care and minimizing expenses.

Method: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Principal Component Analysis were employed to analyze health claims data for predicting readmissions.

Result: Random Forest demonstrated the highest performance evaluated through the Area Under Curve metric, providing more accurate predictions than Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

Conclusion: The models, particularly Random Forest, can help identify the key factors causing readmissions and focus on high-risk patients to reduce recurring admissions and enhance healthcare efficiency while lowering costs.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

*Sekitoshi Kanai,Tsukasa Yoshida,Hiroshi Takahashi,Haru Kuroki,Kazumune Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AISP, a test-time alignment strategy for LLMs optimizing rewards through adaptive importance sampling in the pre-logits layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models at test-time without the high computational demands of fine-tuning.

Method: Adaptive Importance Sampling on Pre-logits (AISP) perturbs the outputs of the penultimate layer using Gaussian noise, optimizing performance via sampling-based model predictive control and reward maximization.

Result: AISP demonstrates superior performance in terms of reward efficiency compared to best-of-n sampling and other existing test-time alignment approaches.

Conclusion: AISP provides a computationally efficient and effective test-time alignment framework for improving reward outcomes of LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable and practical method for machine unlearning by reversing the training process with a projection-redistribution layer, offering model-agnostic and modular deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and practicality issues of machine unlearning methods that require full access to original datasets and models.

Method: Training is approached as a sequential process, with unlearning achieved by reversing the last training sequence using a projection-redistribution layer.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Covertype datasets show performance comparable to full retraining with significantly reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method is scalable, practical, and compatible with existing systems, supporting real-world deployment with minimal alterations to classification pipelines.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

### [234] [Angular Steering: Behavior Control via Rotation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)
*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Angular Steering, a method for modulating behaviors in language models through geometric rotation to improve control and robustness, while maintaining general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving their general capabilities, and overcoming the limitations of existing methods like vector addition and directional ablation.

Method: Angular Steering works by rotating activations within a two-dimensional subspace to control behavior, complemented by Adaptive Angular Steering, a selective variant for enhanced precision and stability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Angular Steering effectively controls behaviors like refusal and compliance across different model families and sizes, ensuring stability and preserving general model performance.

Conclusion: Angular Steering provides a more flexible, robust, and generalized solution for behavior modulation in language models, integrating and improving upon existing techniques while simplifying parameter selection.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel interpolation scheme for generative models, ensuring compatibility with metrics and data distributions, and avoiding restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often lack a principled method for interpolation without imposing significant restrictions on the model or data dimension.

Method: The paper proposes an interpolation approach resembling geodesics constrained to data distributions. It introduces an algorithm that operates without additional training and is theoretically grounded in Riemannian metrics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed interpolation method traverses higher density regions compared to baseline methods across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: The interpolation scheme provides controlled generation while improving exploration of likely paths within generative models, offering a general and versatile approach.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

### [236] [Distributional Multi-objective Black-box Optimization for Diffusion-model Inference-time Multi-Target Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26278)
*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm to enhance diffusion models for multi-objective optimization by optimizing the diffusion process during inference-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat the optimization process as a black-box, which limits efficiency because they don't leverage the internal distribution transitions during diffusion generation.

Method: The proposed IMG employs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process to align samples with an aggregated multi-target Boltzmann distribution, optimizing for multiple objectives simultaneously.

Result: IMG demonstrates superior performance in a multi-objective molecule generation task, attaining a higher hypervolume with a single generation pass compared to existing methods that require numerous passes.

Conclusion: IMG improves the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models in multi-objective optimization and can be integrated with existing methods to enhance their performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

### [237] [Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26284)
*Xia Jiang,Rong J. B. Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multi-task learning in bandits to effectively manage task-specific differences and shared structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance decision-making in multi-bandit instances by better capturing task-specific heterogeneity and leveraging shared structural correlations.

Method: Developing a hierarchical Bayesian model combined with an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate covariance structures for shared and instance-specific variations. Based on this, two algorithms (ebmTS and ebmUCB) are proposed.

Result: Frequentist regret upper bounds for the algorithms are established, and experiments show lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques, proving superior performance.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of hierarchical Bayesian methods in multi-bandit problems, offering enhanced exploration-exploitation balance and outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline preference learning with user diversity and data imbalance through clustering and active data augmentation methods validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference learning is key in areas like reinforcement learning and recommendations but faces challenges in offline settings with user diversity and data imbalance.

Method: Proposed Off-C^2PL for clustering users’ preferences using offline data, alongside A^2-Off-C^2PL for active data augmentation targeting underrepresented dimensions.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved cluster structures and effective active sample selection. Results validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study offers solutions to improve utility and address data imbalance in offline preference learning across diverse user preferences.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in CLIP's compositional reasoning by proposing a token-aware causal representation learning framework, enhancing understanding of CLIP's text and image alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CLIP’s persistent failure at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations, and to provide a token-level understanding of these limitations.

Method: Proposes a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework based on sequential token SCMs, extending block identifiability to tokenized text, and analyzing issues like nonidentifiability in CLIP’s composition.

Result: Demonstrates that pseudo-optimal text encoders achieving modal-invariant alignment can fail at compositional reasoning tasks. The study identifies composition nonidentifiability and highlights the modality gap between text and images.

Conclusion: Token-level analysis reveals critical limitations in CLIP’s compositional capacity and identifies the need for improved strategies, such as better negative mining, to address these challenges.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Continual Learning (CL) without access to previous data by proposing a faster and more accurate method for generating synthetic data using Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) and semantic feature modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of storing and replaying data in CL, particularly for privacy and security reasons, and to enable efficient and accurate data-free continual learning.

Method: The authors introduce Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) to optimize synthetic data generation efficiently, along with semantic-aware modeling of class-wise features using Gaussian distributions and contrastive methods.

Result: Using PMI and feature modeling, the approach effectively enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images. It exhibits strong performance across various CL settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the efficiency and efficacy of data-free continual learning, addressing challenges such as computational expense and feature drift, especially in large pre-trained models like CLIP.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores using quantum annealing for SVM training by analyzing how qubit numbers impact predictive performance, achieving competitive accuracy even with low precision encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether quantum annealing can optimize SVM training efficiently and understand the effect of dual weight discretization on performance.

Method: The authors formulated SVM training as a QUBO problem and examined the impact of qubit counts on classification accuracy while comparing with classical LIBSVM solvers.

Result: Low-precision encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) achieved competitive or superior accuracy, and increased bit-depth did not consistently improve classification.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing has potential for efficient SVM training as devices scale, with findings emphasizing the importance of support vector selection over precise weighting.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the security vulnerabilities of Agent Skills in LLMs, showcasing how simple prompt injections can lead to malicious actions and bypass system guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the unresolved challenge of enabling continual learning in large language models (LLMs) while highlighting the inherent security vulnerabilities in the new Agent Skills framework.

Method: The authors use practical demonstrations to show how malicious instructions can be integrated into long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts, and analyze how guardrails of coding agents can be bypassed.

Result: The study reveals that prompt injections can easily compromise Agent Skills, enabling sensitive data exfiltration and bypassing approval mechanisms for harmful tasks.

Conclusion: Agent Skills, despite being a step forward in LLM capabilities, are highly insecure and vulnerable to simple prompt injections, warranting further research and safeguards in LLMs.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [243] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'interventional constraints,' a new concept in causal discovery, to enforce causal effect inequalities and improve causal model accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine causal models and improve their predictive capability for tasks like treatment design by incorporating high-level causal knowledge as inequality constraints on causal effects.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage constrained optimization method for linear causal models to formalize and integrate 'interventional constraints,' which encode high-level causal knowledge as inequality constraints on causal effects.

Result: The integration of interventional constraints enhances model accuracy, upholds consistency with established knowledge, and enables the discovery of new causal relationships with less computational cost.

Conclusion: The use of interventional constraints makes causal models more reliable, explainable, and effective at uncovering new causal insights.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

### [244] [Reinforcement Learning for Pollution Detection in a Randomized, Sparse and Nonstationary Environment with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26347)
*Sebastian Zieglmeier,Niklas Erdmann,Narada D. Warakagoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits and modifies classical RL approaches to improve their performance in challenging environments marked by sparsity of rewards, randomness, and nonstationarity, particularly for tasks like underwater pollution cloud searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of RL algorithms in handling random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments, such as searching for underwater pollution clouds with AUVs.

Method: The study proposes modifications to traditional RL, including hierarchical algorithm adjustments, multigoal learning, and using location memory to avoid revisits to the same states.

Result: The proposed Monte Carlo-based approach outperformed traditional Q-learning and other search methods, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in solving complex challenges.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can be adapted effectively to handle random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments, as demonstrated by the success of the modified Monte Carlo-based algorithm.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnifiedFL introduces a federated learning framework to address challenges of architectural heterogeneity, non-identically distributed datasets, and domain-fracture issues, improving model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitations of existing FL methods when training collaborative models across fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets.

Method: UnifiedFL utilizes a dynamic framework with a shared graph neural network (GNN) to represent heterogeneous local networks, introduces distance-driven clustering policies, and applies a two-tier aggregation method to balance convergence and diversity.

Result: UnifiedFL achieves superior results in collaborative training tasks compared to existing methods, demonstrated through experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL successfully overcomes key challenges in FL frameworks, providing improved performance for privacy-preserving collaborative model training across varied architectures and data distributions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

*Albi Isufaj,Pablo Mollá,Helmut Prendinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing explainability and reliability in AI models for financial forecasting using methods like time series analysis, reliability estimation, and symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of large neural network models poses issues for trust and regulatory compliance in financial forecasting.

Method: The authors propose three approaches: (1) Time-LLM for avoiding wrong directional forecasts, (2) combining forecasting models with reliability estimators for filtering unreliable predictions, and (3) rule-based symbolic reasoning for transparent decision justification.

Result: The proposed architecture reduces false positives and enables selective forecast execution, as demonstrated on equity and cryptocurrency data.

Conclusion: Integrating predictive performance, reliability measures, and rule-based reasoning creates more transparent, reliable, and auditable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

### [247] [Efficient Generative AI Boosts Probabilistic Forecasting of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26376)
*Ningning Tao,Fei Xie,Baoxiang Pan,Hongyu Wang,Han Huang,Zhongpu Qiu,Ke Gui,Jiali Luo,Xiaosong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FM-Cast, a generative AI model for forecasting Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) efficiently and accurately, surpassing traditional numerical weather prediction systems in speed and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting Sudden Stratospheric Warmings is crucial for understanding and forecasting extreme winter weather, but current numerical weather prediction systems face challenges in this area.

Method: The authors developed FM-Cast, a generative AI model based on Flow Matching, to probabilistically forecast the spatiotemporal dynamics of the stratosphere during SSW events.

Result: FM-Cast forecasts key SSW features with over 50% accuracy for up to 20 days in advance, outperforming traditional systems in efficiency and reliability, while running on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: FM-Cast offers an efficient approach to forecasting stratospheric anomalies, enhances physical understanding of SSWs, and demonstrates AI's potential in climate and weather modeling.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

*Wenchang Duan,Yaoliang Yu,Jiwan He,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive MARL framework that dynamically adjusts context length using temporal gradient analysis and enhances input representation using Fourier-based methods. It achieves state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large fixed context lengths in deep MARL can limit exploration efficiency and cause redundant information. This paper aims to overcome these issues by proposing adaptive context length optimization.

Method: A central agent dynamically optimizes context length through temporal gradient analysis and utilizes Fourier-based low-frequency truncation for efficient input representation.

Result: The framework exhibits state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-term dependency tasks such as PettingZoo, MiniGrid, GRF, and SMACv2.

Conclusion: The proposed MARL framework effectively enhances exploration and convergence to global optima by dynamically optimizing context length and filtering redundant information, showcasing superior performance in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Result: Emerging TWSVM extensions show promise for multi-task settings, although they are underexplored.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive overview of SVM- and TWSVM-based MTL, identifies gaps, and suggests future work on scalable and interpretable frameworks in this domain.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

*Yucen Wang,Fengming Zhang,De-Chuan Zhan,Li Zhao,Kaixin Wang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLA-World introduces a joint training paradigm that combines world models with latent action models for improved video simulation and visual planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address redundant training and limited co-adaptation in existing two-stage approaches using latent action models and world models.

Method: Joint training framework with a critical warm-up phase to align representations between the pre-trained world model and the newly initialized latent action model.

Result: Performance matches or surpasses prior two-stage methods in video simulation quality and visual planning.

Conclusion: CoLA-World establishes a more efficient and synergistic approach for controllable world modeling, setting a new paradigm in the field.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming predictive challenges due to limited trial data in precision medicine for rare patient groups.

Method: Developed CFKD-AFN which uses cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive fusion combining low and high-fidelity data.

Result: CFKD-AFN improves prediction accuracy significantly (6.67% to 74.55%) and shows strong robustness to varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN enhances prediction accuracy, integrates multi-source data effectively, and supports clinical decisions through an interpretable variant.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

*Jiayi Luo,Qingyun Sun,Beining Yang,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Yanbiao Ma,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of graph condensation (GC) against adversarial attacks, using a novel geometry-based framework called MRGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph condensation techniques struggle under adversarial perturbations, leading to significant performance deterioration. Current robust graph learning methods offer limited solutions, necessitating improvement in GC robustness.

Method: The proposed method MRGC employs graph data manifold learning modules to ensure condensed graphs lie in a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, preserving low classification complexity and improving robustness.

Result: The study provides extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that MRGC achieves better robustness than existing methods across various adversarial attack scenarios.

Conclusion: MRGC effectively addresses the vulnerability of GC to adversarial attacks, making it a robust and efficient solution for graph condensation under challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based GAN leveraging a novel anomaly detection strategy for time-series data in network security, achieving high accuracy and feasibility on real quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of detecting anomalies in time-series data, which is crucial for network security. It seeks to combine quantum machine learning with innovative strategies to overcome current limitations in qubit counts and enhance detection performance.

Method: The proposed method involves a QGRU-based GAN with Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy. It employs a quantum-enhanced generator using Gaussian distribution reparameterization and a Wasserstein critic for training stabilization. A unique gating mechanism identifies anomalies through combined Gaussian uncertainty estimates, critic scores, and reconstruction error.

Result: The model achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing classical and quantum models. It also retained strong performance when deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the QGRU-WGAN approach is effective, accurate, and feasible for anomaly detection in time-series data, even on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, marking a step forward in practical quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for data selection in RLVR lack theoretical guarantees and scalability. This work aims to address these limitations by introducing a novel, theoretically grounded data selection method.

Method: CROPI uses off-policy influence estimation and sparse random projection techniques to identify influential data points efficiently, reducing computational cost and enabling scalable training.

Result: Experiments show that CROPI accelerates training by 2.66x for a 1.5B model while using only 10% of the data per stage, demonstrating improved efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Influence-based data selection methods show great promise for improving the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, as evidenced by the proposed CROPI framework.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: The paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as a method to improve ECG monitoring reliability and benchmarks models under strict resource constraints. Results show integrating UAD improves accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous ECG monitoring has potential for early cardiovascular disease detection, but current models face reliability issues caused by Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data in resource-limited setups.

Method: Six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD and other models, were benchmarked with optimization using Neural Architecture Search under strict constraints (<512k parameters), and evaluated on real-world datasets.

Result: Deep SVDD achieved the best trade-off between efficiency and detection. Using Deep SVDD filters with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21 percentage points compared to a classifier-only setup.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters enhance the robustness of automated ECG analysis systems, offering safer and more reliable cardiovascular monitoring through wearables.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called ICPO to improve exploration and stability in reinforcement learning for large reasoning models, outperforming existing methods without requiring advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited trajectory diversity in existing RLVR methods that rely on on-policy rollouts and the high computational cost of using stronger expert models.

Method: Introduced ICPO, a framework leveraging in-context learning of LRMs with a novel Mixed-Policy GRPO approach and additional optimization techniques like Expert Region Reject Sampling and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping.

Result: ICPO showed improved performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ICPO provides a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LRMs, addressing the limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inference latency in LLMs, proposing a novel polybasic speculative decoding framework that enhances inference speed through theoretical grounding and practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inference latency bottleneck in the large-scale deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and improve speculative decoding methods.

Method: A polybasic speculative decoding framework is introduced with a fundamental theorem for multi-model speculative decoding systems, optimizing the interaction between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and computational cost.

Result: The framework demonstrates speedup ratios between 3.31x and 4.43x across various models, preserving the original output distribution. Experimental validation supports these claims.

Conclusion: The novel polybasic speculative decoding framework offers significant improvements in LLM inference latency and integrates well with existing speculative methods, backed by theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for

*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study extends Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), analyzing its theoretical consistency and empirically validating its success in supervised and active learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical hypergraph regularization and establish a principled alternative via HOHL that enforces smoothness and can adapt to diverse learning settings.

Method: Conducted theoretical analysis to prove consistency and convergence rates of a truncated version of HOHL, alongside empirical validations for fully supervised and active learning tasks.

Result: HOHL showed strong performance in active learning tasks and datasets without underlying geometric structures, proving its robustness and versatility.

Conclusion: HOHL, with its strong theoretical underpinning and empirical success, is established as a versatile and effective framework for learning in varied contexts.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

### [259] [A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)
*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN) to enhance transfer learning accuracy, overcome domain shifts, and provide uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods require large, high-quality datasets, which are often unavailable in experimental settings where data may be sparse or noisy. Existing transfer learning techniques struggle with large domain shifts and lack mechanisms for uncertainty quantification.

Method: The study proposes a three-stage framework: Stage 1 trains a deterministic feature extractor on a source domain, Stage 2 refines this extractor using domain-adversarial learning, and Stage 3 builds a Bayesian neural network for uncertainty estimation and fine-tuning on the target domain.

Result: The staged B-DANN was validated on synthetic benchmarks, outperforming standard transfer techniques, and applied to predict critical heat flux in nuclear engineering, achieving improved predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The staged B-DANN approach demonstrates potential for improving transfer learning in data-scarce domains, particularly in nuclear engineering, offering both better predictive performance and calibrated uncertainty measures.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

*Jan Stenkamp,Nina Herrmann,Benjamin Karic,Stefan Oehmcke,Fabian Gieseke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compression scheme for boosted decision trees to reduce the memory footprint for IoT applications, achieving up to 16x compression ratio while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices, particularly in IoT contexts where minimal computing power and energy are critical.

Method: The paper uses techniques for training compact boosted decision tree ensembles by rewarding feature and threshold reuse, along with an adapted training process and alternative memory layout.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the compressed models attain the same performance as traditional models, with a memory compression ratio of 4-16x compared to LightGBM.

Conclusion: The compressed models enable IoT devices to operate autonomously with minimal resources, opening possibilities for applications like remote monitoring and real-time decision-making in constrained environments.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [261] [Multiclass Local Calibration With the Jensen-Shannon Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26566)
*Cesare Barbera,Lorenzo Perini,Giovanni De Toni,Andrea Passerini,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses proximity bias in multiclass classification by introducing a formal definition of local calibration, analyzing existing metric shortcomings, and proposing a novel neural network method using Jensen-Shannon distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve trustworthy machine learning models with well-calibrated predicted probabilities, especially for high-stakes settings where sparse data regions often lead to biased predictions.

Method: The authors define multiclass local calibration, analyze evaluation metric flaws, and propose a Jensen-Shannon distance-based method to improve calibration performance in neural networks.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved local calibration over existing methods through theoretical and empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: A refined focus on local calibration in multiclass classification addresses proximity bias and enhances model reliability, contributing to more trustworthy predictions.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regression method for probability distributions using Bernstein basis parameterization and Wasserstein distance minimization, offering improvements in computational efficiency, geometric accuracy, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression over distributions is increasingly significant in machine learning, but current methods overlook probability space geometry or are computationally expensive.

Method: The method leverages Bernstein polynomial-based parameterization of probability trajectories as weighted sums of Gaussian components, optimized using autodiff and a Wasserstein distance-based loss.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data reveal competitive performance in approximation quality, trajectory smoothness, robustness to structural changes, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines computation, geometry, and interpretability, providing scope for extensions to non-Gaussian distributions, high-dimensional data, and entropy regularization for improved performance.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Aeolus, a multi-modal flight delay dataset for advancing flight delay predictions and structured data research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a comprehensive dataset capturing spatiotemporal dynamics and delay propagation, which existing flat tabular datasets fail to address.

Method: Aeolus provides three aligned modalities: tabular data, flight chain modules, and flight network graphs, supporting various machine learning tasks with robust temporal splits and preprocessing tools.

Result: Aeolus offers rich operational, meteorological, and resource connections data for over 50 million flights. It enables broad tasks like regression, classification, temporal modeling, and graph learning.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges gaps in domain-specific modeling and general-purpose research. Its release encourages widespread adoption and further advancement in relevant fields.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unifying framework based on heat kernels for Bayesian Optimization (BO) in combinatorial domains, showing their efficiency across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization requires suitable kernels to model combinatorial tasks effectively, but the relationships between existing kernels are unclear.

Method: The authors systematically derive heat kernels as closed-form expressions, analyze their theoretical connections to other kernels, and assess their performance experimentally.

Result: Experiments confirm the superiority and robustness of heat kernels across different tasks without sensitivity to optima location, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Heat kernels provide a fast and effective alternative for combinatorial tasks in Bayesian Optimization, outperforming more complex methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an evaluation of time series classification methods for selecting the best anomaly detection models based on time series characteristics, addressing the challenge of heterogeneous datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods do not perform consistently well across diverse and heterogeneous time series datasets. There is a need for a scalable approach to select the best anomaly detection method tailored for specific time series characteristics.

Method: The authors evaluate 234 model configurations from 16 base classifiers across 1980 time series to assess the potential of time series classification as a model selection method for anomaly detection.

Result: Model selection methods based on time series classification outperform every individual anomaly detection method while maintaining comparable execution time.

Conclusion: The study proves that time series classification can serve as an effective and efficient model selection baseline for anomaly detection in diverse time series datasets, offering a foundation for broader AutoML implementations.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Motivation: To assess how AI advancements in knowledge and reasoning benchmarks translate into economic value and automation.

Method: Development of the Remote Labor Index (RLI) to benchmark AI's performance on economically valuable real-world projects.

Result: AI agents show low automation rates, with the highest-performing at 2.5%, indicating limited practical capability currently.

Conclusion: RLI sets a basis for empirically analyzing AI's economic impacts and guides stakeholders in addressing AI-driven labor automation.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and

and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable

*Katarina Petrović,Lazar Atanackovic,Viggo Moro,Kacper Kapuśniak,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents 'Curly Flow Matching,' a novel approach to model non-gradient field dynamics, improving upon limitations of existing methods in capturing periodic behaviors in natural processes like cell cycles and fluid dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models rely on gradient field dynamics under the principle of least action, limiting their capability to model periodic systems observed in real-world processes such as single-cell RNA cycles.

Method: The authors propose 'Curly Flow Matching,' utilizing a Schrödinger bridge framework with a non-zero drift reference process derived from inferred velocities alongside population snapshot data.

Result: Curly-FM achieves better trajectory matching for periodic dynamics in systems like single cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Curly-FM broadens flow matching models' applicability by effectively modeling non-gradient and periodic behaviors in natural physical systems.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies that using FP16 precision instead of BF16 in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models improves stability, optimization, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address instability in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models, caused by mismatches between the policies used in training and inference.

Method: The authors isolate the problem to floating point precision, proposing the use of FP16 instead of BF16. This involves minimal changes to code without altering model architecture or learning algorithms.

Result: Using FP16 resolves policy mismatches, leading to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across different tasks, algorithms, and frameworks.

Conclusion: Employing FP16 precision offers a simple and effective solution to mitigate numerical mismatches in RL fine-tuning, prompting a reevaluation of precision choices in machine learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) to improve latent representation quality for robust world models, achieving better long-horizon predictions and rollout fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models struggle to maintain accuracy over long horizons due to poor representation quality, stemming from lossy or entangled latent variables of high-dimensional exteroceptive inputs.

Method: The GRWM approach enforces geometric regularization by ensuring consecutive sensory trajectory points remain close in latent representation space, improving latent structure alignment with true environment topology.

Result: GRWM significantly improves rollout fidelity and stability in deterministic 3D environments and long-horizon predictions by enhancing latent manifold geometric structure.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning directly enhances world-model performance, enabling reliable predictions in complex tasks without expanding the dynamics module.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient differentially private algorithm for computing the top singular vectors of a matrix, addressing a key question on privacy and performance in spectral methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the performance of private algorithms for rank-$r$ matrix approximation, particularly under high coherence and spectral gap conditions, where previous private methods underperformed.

Method: Using singular value decomposition combined with standard differential privacy perturbation mechanisms, the method leverages properties like rank-$r$ coherence and spectral gap.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance for private single-spike PCA in the Wishart model and maintains input coherence, outperforming previous private algorithms.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and applicable to broader problems such as Max-Cut, offering advances in maintaining privacy while ensuring performance comparability to non-private methods.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

*Amir Reza Mirzaei,Yuqiao Wen,Yanshuai Cao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant is introduced as a mixed-precision quantization technique to optimize LoRA adapters' efficiency, ensuring high compression with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing necessity to load multiple LoRA adapters simultaneously for customized and multi-task LLM usage leads to substantial aggregate costs at scale, prompting the need for efficient solutions.

Method: LoRAQuant applies singular value decomposition (SVD) to LoRA adapters, concentrating critical information and allowing selective quantization of components at varying precisions (higher for crucial parts and ultra-low bitwidth for less important ones).

Result: LoRAQuant significantly reduces storage costs compared to other quantization methods while maintaining or surpassing performance across mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks on various LLMs.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant effectively addresses the scalability issue of multiple LoRA adapter usage by offering a storage-efficient yet high-performing quantization method specialized for LoRA.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of regularization terms in invertible neural networks' training to establish connections with Bayesian point estimators like posterior mean and MAP estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invertible neural networks have stability and interpretability but struggle to approximate Bayesian-based reconstruction and forward operators effectively. The study aims to resolve these limitations by introducing new regularization terms.

Method: Two regularization terms were introduced to the training process of invertible neural networks. These terms aim to recover properties associated with Bayesian point estimators and shape the learned operators.

Result: The analysis revealed how the proposed loss terms influence the forward operator and reconstruction map. Numerical experiments confirmed that these terms provide stable, interpretable results dependent on data.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization terms successfully connect invertible neural network training to classical Bayesian estimators, enabling stable and interpretable behavior in reconstruction applications.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

*Jamie Lanyon,Axel Finke,Petros Andreou,Georgina Cosma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of considering model training seed variability in empirical comparisons of Machine Unlearning (MU) algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MU algorithms aim to efficiently remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model without retraining, addressing practical applications of privacy and data control.

Method: The authors empirically analyze the sensitivity of various MU methods to random number seeds used for initial model training.

Result: They demonstrate that certain MU methods are highly sensitive to model training seeds, resulting in potentially unrepresentative empirical performance comparisons.

Conclusion: Empirical comparisons of MU algorithms must incorporate variability from different training seeds to ensure more accurate assessments.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new mechanism for releasing d-dimensional covariance matrices under pure differential privacy, achieving optimal error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the error guarantees of private covariance matrix estimation, focusing on Frobenius norm and other Schatten norms.

Method: Proposed a perturbation mechanism with projection onto nuclear norm ball for small datasets, achieving better theoretical error bounds.

Result: Demonstrated optimal error guarantees across multiple norms, with best known results for spectral norm among purely private estimators.

Conclusion: The mechanism sets new benchmarks for private covariance estimation, handling both small and large datasets efficiently.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaMP quantization is introduced to enhance low-bit activation quantization by leveraging sequence dimension transformations and mixed precision, achieving notable performance improvements in LVM and LLM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sharp degradation in accuracy when activations in generative AI models are quantized below eight bits.

Method: Proposes Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision (STaMP) quantization, applying linear transformations along the sequence dimension and using mixed precision for intermediate activations.

Result: STaMP demonstrated significant improvements in low-bit activation quantization for LVM and LLM architectures, complementing existing quantization methods.

Conclusion: Sequence-based linear transformations and mixed precision effectively enhance quantization, maintaining accuracy while reducing activation bit widths in generative AI models.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

*Jungyeon Koh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Jonggyu Jang,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances influence function estimations by introducing feature and logit-based sampling methods, achieving better computational efficiency and improved model outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence functions are valuable for interpreting training data influence on black-box models, but computational challenges arise from using Hessians for large datasets.

Method: The authors propose advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits to select small, representative subsets of training data, thereby improving influence function estimations.

Result: The methods reduce computation time by 30.1%, memory usage by 42.2%, and improve the F1-score by 2.5% compared to traditional sampling methods.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling techniques offer a resource-efficient and accurate way to compute influence functions, validating their effectiveness through class removal experiments.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: The study investigates the generalizability of frozen pre-trained forecasting models for classification tasks, demonstrating their competitive performance compared with task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether pre-trained forecasting models can effectively generalize and serve as representations for classification.

Method: The paper analyzes different representation extraction strategies and introduces embedding augmentations. It compares forecasting models against state-of-the-art classification models.

Result: The research shows that forecasting models achieve classification accuracy comparable or superior to task-specific classification models, with a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performances.

Conclusion: Forecasting-based pre-trained models can challenge traditional task-specific pre-training, suggesting forecasting as a possible route to develop general-purpose time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

### [279] [Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792)
*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how Transformers can predict sequences generated by complex pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), showing impressive predictive capabilities, even under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have revolutionized sequence modeling, but their ability to learn highly complex sequences generated by PRNGs, especially Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), had not been thoroughly studied.

Method: The study involves applying Transformer models on PRNG sequences with moduli up to $2^{22}$, datasets of up to $5$ billion tokens, and models with up to $50$ million parameters. The process includes tasks such as truncation analysis, learning multiple PRNGs simultaneously, and curriculum learning for higher modulus setups.

Result: The models were capable of reliably predicting sequences even when truncated to a single bit, jointly learned structures from various PRNGs, and displayed scaling laws where required in-context elements increased with the square root of the modulus. Curriculum learning was essential for learning higher moduli.

Conclusion: Transformers have the capability to predict and learn complex PRNG sequences, identifying intricate structures and demonstrating scaling phenomena with modulus growth. Moreover, clustering analysis reveals how models internally organize inputs for effective learning across scenarios.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

TL;DR: This paper introduces voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) for efficient unsupervised learning in memristive devices, demonstrating improvements in MNIST recognition tasks on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in AI deployment on edge computing devices, focusing on energy efficiency and functional adaptability through brain-inspired mechanisms.

Method: The authors developed VDSP for Hebbian-based unsupervised learning in memristive devices, tested it on three different device types, and performed system-level simulations for neural networks.

Result: The approach achieved over 83% accuracy on MNIST-pattern recognition across all tested devices using 200 neurons, along with evaluations of device variability and robustness enhancement strategies.

Conclusion: VDSP provides an efficient and robust method for online, unsupervised learning in edge devices, combining simplicity and high accuracy potential for AI workloads.

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Neurochaos Learning (NL), a chaos-based brain-inspired approach, for forest fire prediction, demonstrating improved performance over ML/DL models, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the prediction performance of forest fire classification models, overcoming the limitations of traditional ML and DL models in handling nonlinear patterns and reliance on extensive training data.

Method: The authors introduce Neurochaos Learning (NL), which employs one-dimensional chaotic maps as neurons, mimicking the human brain's ability to learn nonlinear patterns with limited data. A specialized version, Random Heterogeneous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), utilizes diverse chaotic neurons for enhanced performance.

Result: The proposed RHNL method achieved an F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset and high precision scores for other datasets, outperforming traditional ML classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Conclusion: Neurochaos Learning (NL), particularly its RHNL variant, provides an efficient, interpretable, and high-performing approach for forest fire prediction, showing promise as an alternative to conventional ML/DL methods.

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of traditional computing systems for real-time solutions of large-scale and complex problems using artificial neural networks.

Method: The paper suggests leveraging wireless sensor networks with distributed processing capabilities to implement artificial neural network algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates how a network of hundreds of thousands of nodes can compute large-scale ANN problems in real time, utilizing parallel and distributed architecture.

Conclusion: If successful, the approach could revolutionize computation by enabling practical and affordable solutions to large-scale problems through distributed neuro-computing systems.

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

*Izzy Grosof,Daniela Hurtado-Lange*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: A new scheduling policy, SEK-SMOD, is introduced, which performs better than SRPT-k across all loads and job size distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a better scheduling policy with lower mean response time than SRPT-$k$ for multiserver queues under heavy traffic loads.

Method: SEK-SMOD prioritizes large jobs over small ones in certain scenarios, coupled with a novel hybrid worst-case and stochastic analytical approach. A practical variant (Practical-SEK) was also simulated.

Result: SEK-SMOD achieves provably lower mean response times compared to SRPT-$k$, validated through both theoretical analysis and simulations.

Conclusion: SEK-SMOD demonstrates an innovative improvement in scheduling policies, showing potential for better server utilization and response times.

Abstract: A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance
improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known
to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic
limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$
queue in any regime.
  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),
which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than
SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size
distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over
small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby
improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a
novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative
analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away
from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a
simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over
SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces System-X, a hardware-centric approach that utilizes low-level hardware signals for system optimization without requiring workload knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operators struggle to optimize resources on virtualized platforms due to the lack of user workload insights, which limits cost-efficiency and performance optimization.

Method: System-X employs hardware signals and an unsupervised learning pipeline to detect anomalies, based on analysis of over 30 ML models across various hardware platforms.

Result: System-X identified network and system configuration issues, enabling a performance improvement of 5.97% on the DeepSeek model.

Conclusion: System-X demonstrates the feasibility of optimizing systems using hardware signals, offering adaptability to diverse workloads and deployment patterns.

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack
ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many
users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient
resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,
which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This
hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure
cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that
workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose
System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on
hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals
collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised
learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML
models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging
workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully
identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the
DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

*Abdelhakim Ziani,András Horváth,Paolo Ballarini*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining Bernstein phase-type (BPH) and hyperexponential (HE) distributions to better approximate heavy-tailed distributions, addressing limitations of both methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed distributions are hard to model accurately due to their slow tail decay. Existing models like BPH and HE struggle with either the tail or body, necessitating a better solution.

Method: A hybrid model integrating BPH and HE distributions is proposed, with optimization to enhance HE model robustness and ensure valid initialization parameters.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms both BPH and HE individually in approximating heavy-tailed distributions. It captures both body and tail regions while improving mean and coefficient of variation.

Conclusion: The hybrid model is validated experimentally, demonstrating superior approximation quality and practical effectiveness in applications like queuing theory.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications
such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language
processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay.
Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability
and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution,
but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors
exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the
contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,
hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.
Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,
significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE
distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced
approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial
parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and
reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE
model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is
more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More
precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed
distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as
mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments
utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and
precision of our hybrid approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve search strategies through fairness while achieving efficiency and compositionality in functional programming contexts.

Method: Introduce fairness via bounded work, implemented through a seekable iterator interface for worst-case optimal joins.

Result: Demonstrates an elegant solution through bounded work for interleaving strategies and implementing optimal joins.

Conclusion: Bounded work fairness is a key principle for achieving efficient and compositional methods in search strategies and data joins.

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet
efficient search strategy, fairly interleaving execution between disjuncts.
This fairness is accomplished by bounding how much work is done exploring one
disjunct before switching to the next. We show that the same idea -- fairness
via bounded work -- underlies an elegant compositional approach to implementing
worst-case optimal joins using a seekable iterator interface, suitable for
shallow embedding in functional languages.

*Kevin Qiu,Marek Cygan*

TL;DR: Debate2Create (D2C) uses large language models (LLMs) in a structured debate format to co-design robots' morphology and control systems, yielding improved and diverse designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of robot co-design, which is complex due to the vast design space and the interdependence between a robot's physical structure and its control mechanisms.

Method: A framework called Debate2Create (D2C) is introduced where LLM agents engage in debates. These agents iteratively propose changes to a robot's morphology and its control strategies, which are then evaluated in simulations.

Result: D2C generated robot designs that achieved 73% better performance in a quadruped locomotion benchmark compared to default designs, without explicitly optimizing for diversity.

Conclusion: Structured debates between LLM agents, supported by physics-based feedback, can provide an effective paradigm for automating robot co-design, producing diverse and high-performing results.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising

### [288] [Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913)
*Gilbert Bahati,Ryan M. Bena,Meg Wilkinson,Pol Mestres,Ryan K. Cosner,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative method for robotic systems to ensure risk-aware navigation by utilizing mathematical constructs like Poisson's and Laplace's equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing robotic systems capable of safely navigating real-world environments by integrating risk-awareness into their safety filters.

Method: The approach involves encoding the environment using Poisson's equation (to generate safety functions) and Laplace guidance fields (to represent cautious navigation around obstacles), followed by combining these to create a risk-aware safety filter.

Result: Simulation demonstrations show the effectiveness of combining obstacle risk-level understanding with safety filters, ensuring risk-aware safe behaviors.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective mathematical framework to incorporate semantic and risk-level understandings into robotic safety filters for reliable and obstacle-avoiding navigation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

*Luoyan Zhong,Heather Jin Hee Kim,Dylan P. Losey,Cara M. Nunez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This research develops a curvature-aware calibration model to enhance the accuracy and reliability of flexible tactile sensors on curved surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tactile sensors lack accuracy and consistency when applied to curved surfaces, limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios.

Method: A neural network (multilayer perceptron) was trained to predict surface curvature based on baseline sensor outputs, and a calibration model was developed for resistive tactile sensors on curved surfaces.

Result: The approach achieved an R2 score of 0.91 and ensured consistent force accuracy on various curved surfaces, outperforming flat-surface calibrations.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware calibration improves the accuracy and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, bridging the gap for practical applications on non-flat surfaces.

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

### [290] [A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985)
*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attitude control law that addresses limitations in quaternion-based methods by ensuring a unique closed-loop equilibrium attitude-error quaternion and improved proportional control in rotational systems like drones and satellites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quaternion-based attitude control has been effective but faces challenges like non-unique equilibrium and diminished control effects for certain rotational errors, prompting the need for better approaches.

Method: The proposed control law leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle information and constructs strict Lyapunov functions to achieve unique and uniformly asymptotically stable closed-loop equilibria.

Result: Numerical simulations and real-time experiments on a quadrotor demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms high-performance quaternion-based controllers, especially in terms of stabilization time.

Conclusion: This axis-angle-based control law provides improved attitude control performance, making it a viable alternative to quaternion-based methods for rigid body rotational systems.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

*Bai Li,Achilleas Kourtellis,Rong Cao,Joseph Post,Brian Porter,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARTS, an AI-powered drone system, achieving 99% accuracy in real-time traffic incident detection and demonstrating significant benefits in speed, scalability, and adaptability compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional traffic incident detection methods needing dense infrastructure, separation between detection and verification, and lack of adaptability and scalability.

Method: DARTS combines drones with thermal imaging, aerial surveillance, and a lightweight deep learning model to extract vehicle trajectories and detect incidents in real-time.

Result: DARTS achieved 99% detection accuracy, verified incidents faster than conventional systems, and monitored congestion propagation effectively during real-world testing on Interstate 75.

Conclusion: DARTS offers a scalable, cost-effective, and rapid traffic incident detection system enhancing emergency response and proactive traffic control, with potential for deployment in remote and resource-constrained areas.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

### [292] [RADRON: Cooperative Localization of Ionizing Radiation Sources by MAVs with Compton Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26018)
*Petr Stibinger,Tomas Baca,Daniela Doubravova,Jan Rusnak,Jaroslav Solc,Jan Jakubek,Petr Stepan,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for detecting radioactive materials using cooperating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) equipped with small and sensitive Compton detectors, providing real-time localization and tracking of radiation sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a new and efficient approach for locating radioactive materials by using lightweight, agile MAVs equipped with sensitive detection technologies, overcoming challenges of real-time localization and processing using minimal measurements.

Method: The paper proposes the integration of lightweight Compton cameras on MAVs for detecting ionizing radiation. Measurements by these cameras are fused to estimate the source's position, with onboard data processing enabling dynamic feedback to optimize MAV motion and maximize detection capability.

Result: The MAV swarm successfully stabilizes, cooperates, and rapidly detects the radiation source's location based on sparse input data. It further tracks moving radiation sources using a dynamic feedback system.

Conclusion: This approach leverages the lightweight design and advanced technology of Compton cameras integrated with MAV swarms to establish an innovative solution for efficient radiation detection and source tracking in real time.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

### [293] [Accelerating Real-World Overtaking in F1TENTH Racing Employing Reinforcement Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26040)
*Emily Steiner,Daniel van der Spuy,Futian Zhou,Afereti Pama,Minas Liarokapis,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new autonomous racing and overtaking agent for wheel-to-wheel racing, achieving high overtaking success in both simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing performance as existing algorithms struggle with safe and reliable overtaking, a critical aspect for practical autonomous driving.

Method: The researchers developed a novel agent capable of learning to navigate and overtake in wheel-to-wheel racing scenarios. It was trained and evaluated on the F1Tenth framework in both simulation and real-world environments, competing against various opponent strategies.

Result: The agent achieved an overtaking success rate of 87% in real-world scenarios, significantly outperforming a race-only trained agent, which had a 56% success rate.

Conclusion: Training autonomous agents for overtaking behaviors results in improved performance in competitive racing scenarios, showcasing the importance of dedicated learning for reliable overtaking.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

*Chi Zhang,Mingrui Li,Wenzhe Tong,Xiaonan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method using Graph Neural Networks for improved locomotion control in tensegrity robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome locomotion control challenges in tensegrity robots caused by their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics.

Method: Integrating a Graph Neural Network-based policy into the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm to leverage the robot's topology for efficient and robust learning.

Result: Validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot, it exhibits superior sample efficiency, trajectory accuracy, noise robustness, and direct transferability from simulation to hardware.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors using GNN enhances learning and control in tensegrity robots, demonstrating stable real-world performance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies dynamics of responsibility regarding distress caused to children due to discontinuation of social robots like Moxie, analyzing through a survey on perspectives of robot companies, parents, developers, and governments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the significant emotional distress faced by children due to abrupt discontinuation of emotionally bonding robots, leading to the need for accountability frameworks.

Method: Qualitative research using surveys collected from 72 U.S. participants (covering perspectives influenced by political beliefs and parental status).

Result: It revealed varied views on accountability, with shared responsibility noted among companies, parents, developers, and the government, while outlining polarized preferences regarding robot continuation.

Conclusion: The study offers a framework for shared accountability and outlines design and policy recommendations to minimize emotional distress in robot discontinuation.

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

### [296] [Beyond the Uncanny Valley: A Mixed-Method Investigation of Anthropomorphism in Protective Responses to Robot Abuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26082)
*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines how robot anthropomorphism levels influence protective and moral responses to their abuse, highlighting an inverse correlation with the uncanny valley theory and moral reasoning shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how varying levels of anthropomorphism in robots affect human protective and moral reactions, aiming to contribute insights into robot-human interaction theories like CASA and the uncanny valley.

Method: The methodology involves an experiment with 201 participants watching abuse videos of robots (categorized as low, moderate, or high anthropomorphism). Data was collected through surveys, facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections.

Result: Findings revealed non-linear protective responses, heightened physiological anger, and increased moral reasoning as anthropomorphism increased, especially with the moderately anthropomorphic robot eliciting the most ‘spine-tingling’ reactions.

Conclusion: The uncanny valley amplifies protective and moral concerns rather than diminishing them, providing key implications for robot design, legal policies, and societal governance frameworks.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

*Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses embodied intelligence (EI) as a principle for designing advanced microrobotics, focusing on co-design of physical structure and behavioral functions. It analyzes examples of robots whose intelligent behavior emerges from their physical properties and environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore embodied intelligence as a foundational design principle for creating intelligent microrobots that leverage their structural and material dynamics.

Method: The paper introduces and evaluates a co-design approach where physical structure and behavioral function are developed simultaneously, contrasting it with traditional robotic architectures. Examples of robots developed by the AMSL are analyzed.

Result: Robotic platforms such as Bee++, RoBeetle, and others successfully demonstrate that embedding sensing, actuation, and control directly into physical structures enables intelligent behaviors even at small scales.

Conclusion: Co-designing robotic systems enables scalable, robust, and efficient alternatives to classical control strategies, facilitating intelligent microrobots based on embodied intelligence principles.

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study presents a kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) framework that combines symbolic and numerical decision-making to address the inefficiency of traditional methods and LLM-based planners in long-horizon problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAMP methods struggle with computational costs in long-horizon problems due to excessive motion sampling, and while LLMs add commonsense priors, they fall short in spatial reasoning and feasibility guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces a kinodynamic TAMP framework utilizing a hybrid state tree to integrate symbolic and numeric states. It verifies constraints using a motion planner and physics simulator and employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to guide and optimize the planning process.

Result: Experiments in simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate up to 1166.67% increase in success rates and shorter planning times compared to traditional and LLM-based TAMP methods, validating the advantage of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances TAMP by merging symbolic, numerical, and visual reasoning, demonstrating higher efficiency and effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon problems.

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

*Hahjin Lee,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm for mobile robot trajectory planning, which ensures safety and efficiency, especially in cluttered environments with narrow passages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for trajectory planning in mobile robots often fail or generate suboptimal paths in environments with narrow passages, necessitating a robust solution for safety and efficiency.

Method: The proposed adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm employs a two-stage process: (1) segment-wise collision testing, breaking down risky segments until they are risk-free, and (2) pose-level pose correction using penetration direction and line search to avoid collisions.

Result: The algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 1.69x higher success rates and 3.79x faster planning times in simulations, with real-world experiments validating its effectiveness in navigating narrow passages safely and swiftly.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves mobile robot trajectory planning in cluttered environments, allowing for safe and rapid navigation through narrow passages.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve self-localization in autonomous driving, especially in challenging environments with dynamic obstacles, where conventional camera-based CNN methods struggle.

Method: The authors propose combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer to enhance feature extraction by leveraging both local and global feature detection.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements: 1.5 times better accuracy on datasets with dynamic obstacles compared to without, a 20.1% smaller error than SOTA on public datasets, and an average self-localization error of 7.51cm on their robot.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves self-localization accuracy in dynamic obstacle environments, demonstrating its superiority over existing techniques.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

TL;DR: PHUMA is introduced as a scalable, physically-grounded humanoid locomotion dataset addressing common issues in video-based motion data, outperforming existing datasets like Humanoid-X and AMASS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and physically reliable humanoid locomotion dataset by addressing artifacts and limitations in existing motion capture and video-based motion datasets.

Method: PHUMA introduces a dataset created through large-scale video data curation and physics-constrained retargeting, enforcing joint limits, ground contact, and eliminating foot skating for reliable and diverse motion generation.

Result: PHUMA-trained policies demonstrate superior performance in tasks such as motion imitation from unseen videos and path following, surpassing results achieved with Humanoid-X and AMASS datasets.

Conclusion: PHUMA advances humanoid locomotion research by offering scalable, diverse, and physically-grounded data, overcoming significant artifacts present in previous approaches.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

TL;DR: Thor is a humanoid framework designed to improve whole-body reactions for contact-rich tasks, tested successfully on the Unitree G1 robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop humanoids capable of sustaining stability and adaptive human-like responses in force-intensive, contact-rich environments.

Method: Proposed a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function and a reinforcement learning framework that decouples humanoid body parts for efficient control.

Result: Thor significantly outperformed baselines in force-interaction tasks, achieving 48% of the robot's body weight in peak pulling force and successfully performing actions like pulling a loaded rack and opening a fire door.

Conclusion: Thor enhances humanoid capabilities in force-intensive tasks, showcasing its potential for service, industrial, and rescue applications.

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

*Mirko Usuelli,David Rapado-Rincon,Gert Kootstra,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM integrates Visual-LiDAR SLAM and multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust, real-time orchard mapping across challenging seasonal and structural conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous robots to perform real-time 3D scene understanding in orchards despite challenges such as repetitive row geometry, seasonal changes, and environmental factors like wind-driven foliage motion.

Method: AgriGS-SLAM combines direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering. It employs batch rasterization to manage occlusions and utilizes a gradient-driven map lifecycle for memory efficiency and detail preservation. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR depth consistency term, projected through cameras for enhanced geometry-appearance correlation.

Result: AgriGS-SLAM excels in achieving robust reconstruction and steadier trajectories under complex orchard environments compared to recent 3DGS-SLAM benchmarks. Deployed across different seasons and orchard sites, it maintains effective real-time operations.

Conclusion: AgriGS-SLAM is effective for autonomous orchard monitoring and mapping applications. Its principles can extend to other outdoor scenarios requiring multimodal perception and real-time 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

*Tobias Löw,Cem Bilaloglu,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for cooperative task spaces in multi-arm robotic systems using conformal geometric algebra, enabling easier modeling and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of coordinating movements in complex multi-arm robotic systems with high degrees of freedom.

Method: The authors leverage geometric primitives and conformal geometric algebra to derive cooperative task spaces and analytic/geometric Jacobian matrices for robotic control.

Result: Experiments with bimanual manipulators, humanoids, and multi-fingered hands validate the control framework for optimal control and teleoperation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies the representation and control of multi-arm robotic systems while enabling secondary control objectives through embedded nullspace structures.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores partial automation of forestry forwarders via reinforcement learning, achieving a success rate of 94% for log loading tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forestry forwarder operations are physically and mentally taxing for operators, prompting exploration into automation to ease their workload.

Method: The study develops a simulated model in NVIDIA's Isaac Gym using reinforcement learning and curriculum learning to train an agent for log handling.

Result: The trained agent achieved 94% success in locating, grappling, and delivering logs in simulation.

Conclusion: The research represents a significant step toward automating forestry forwarders using reinforcement learning, reducing operator stress and increasing efficiency.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

*Guanxing Lu,Rui Zhao,Haitao Lin,He Zhang,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Hi-ORS, a post-training method combining aspects of RL and IL for robotic manipulation, showcasing quick fine-tuning and improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the stability and robustness of vision-language-action models in robotic manipulation tasks, overcoming challenges in RL and IL methods.

Method: Introduced Hi-ORS, which employs rejection sampling to filter negative samples and reward-weighted training to stabilize value estimation and enhance supervision during intermediate steps.

Result: Hi-ORS achieved high efficiency in fine-tuning robotic manipulation policies, outperforming traditional RL and IL across three tasks and two embodiments, mastering tasks in 1.5 hours.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS effectively bridges the gap between RL and IL approaches, providing a stable, efficient, and scalable method for robotic learning with promising performance in complex, real-world tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome the limitations of existing systems that depend on individual memories, which restrict long-term learning, scalability in heterogeneous teams, and failure recovery.

Method: RoboOS-NeXT uses Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM) integrated into a brain-cerebellum framework to enable cohesive memory representation and synchronized collaboration among robots.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in complex coordination tasks, demonstrating the framework's ability to achieve scalable and robust multi-robot collaboration across varied environments.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT effectively addresses challenges in multi-robot collaboration by introducing a unified memory framework, enhancing adaptability, coordination, and fault tolerance.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

*Prathamesh Kothavale,Sravani Boddepalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework enabling robots to effectively use tools by expanding their inverse kinematics solver capabilities and transferring simulation-acquired skills to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots traditionally lack the ability to deeply understand kinematics and efficiently use tools; the paper aims to overcome this limitation to advance robotic tool manipulation skills.

Method: The researchers developed an advanced inverse kinematics solver paired with simulation-learned action trajectories for tool manipulation, enabling precise actions with tools of different lengths.

Result: The extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrated an error rate under 1 cm, and the trained policy achieved a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Performance remained consistent across different tool lengths.

Conclusion: The approach shows promising advancements in robotic tool usage, addressing all fundamental aspects and paving the way for intricate tool manipulation across various tasks.

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLYINGTRUST, a benchmarking framework for visual navigation algorithms in quadrotors to evaluate robustness against variations in platform kinodynamics and scenario structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance variability of quadrotor navigation algorithms when deployed across different vehicle platforms and environments, thus reducing deployment cost and risk.

Method: FLYINGTRUST benchmarks visual navigation robustness using two compact indicators of vehicle capability (thrust-to-weight ratio and angular acceleration). It also includes a scenario library, heterogeneous platforms, and a standardized evaluation protocol with composite scoring.

Result: Using FLYINGTRUST for evaluation revealed that navigation success depends on platform capabilities and scene geometry, with distinct patterns and failure modes for different algorithms.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes incorporating platform capabilities and scenario structures in algorithm development and evaluation to achieve robustness across diverse conditions, urging advancements in adaptable navigation solutions.

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first stochastic sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation in continuum robots (CRs), addressing accuracy and runtime constraints for online operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CR state estimation methods face challenges with either simplified approximations or runtime efficiency. There is a lack of methods combining stochastic representation, accuracy, and real-time capability.

Method: The authors propose a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation of CRs, combining improvements in accuracy and faster-than-real-time operation for online use.

Result: The SWF approach successfully enables online continuous-time stochastic state estimation for CRs, achieving faster-than-real-time computational efficiency while improving accuracy.

Conclusion: This novel method provides a promising solution for online state estimation in CRs, paving the way for future research on stochastic and efficient techniques in this domain.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in path-planning and control for autonomous robots in dynamic and partially observable environments.

Method: Integrates a DQN for high-level decision-making with a TD3 controller for smooth low-level actuation, combined with reward shaping and safety mechanisms.

Result: The framework shows improved success rate, path efficiency, and generalization capabilities compared to baselines, alongside reduced control abruptness.

Conclusion: The hierarchical architecture enhances planning and actuation for robotic navigation, demonstrating robustness in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes heuristic likelihood-free inference (LFI) methods to address support misspecification issues, enhancing inference and improving robotic agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics tasks require accurate domain distribution adaptation to ensure robust agent behavior, but support misspecification in LFI can lead to suboptimal results.

Method: Three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE are introduced, which adjust support based on posterior mode shifts during inference steps.

Result: Heuristic methods refine length and stiffness classification in deformable linear objects (DLO) and yield robust performance in sim-based policy learning.

Conclusion: Adaptation of support in LFI improves domain distribution accuracy, leading to better parameter inference and enhanced robotic policy learning outcomes.

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP) to enhance visuomotor policy learning by combining stochastic denoising processes and one-step jumps, achieving faster sampling and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based imitation learning methods struggle to balance fast sampling and maintaining multi-modal behavior diversity in visuomotor policy learning.

Method: The authors introduce the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP), which combines a stochastic prefix with an adaptive switch to a single consistency jump for inference. Training involves time-varying consistency distillation using a trajectory-consistency and denoising-matching objective.

Result: HCP achieved comparable accuracy and mode coverage as an 80-step Diffusion Denoising Process Model (DDPM) teacher, but with significantly reduced computational latency by using only 25 SDE steps and one jump.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that high multi-modality and efficient robot policy inference can coexist, offering a new method that balances accuracy and speed in visuomotor learning tasks.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Result: Demonstrates a 100% success rate in grasping a falling pen task, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy in a real-world scenario.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a full streaming inference framework proposition, enabling robust real-time control of VLA models in dynamic robotic tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a
full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a holistic risk governance framework for enterprises engaging with open source, addressing a wide range of risks beyond technical tools through a structured approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional risk management approaches focusing only on technical tools are insufficient to address systemic threats in open source engagement.

Method: Grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to formalize a framework, validated by three experts through case studies.

Result: The study developed and validated a diagnostic framework that includes mechanisms to map objectives, threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies systematically.

Conclusion: The framework enables organizations to transition from reactive risk management to proactive governance, fostering resilience against systemic risks in open source contexts.

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

### [319] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the environmental impacts, particularly carbon and water footprints, of GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, based on a dataset of over 2.2 million workflow runs from 18,000 repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the lack of awareness among developers regarding carbon and water footprints (CWF) of CI/CD pipelines, given the environmental impact of cloud computing.

Method: The study builds upon the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework and analyzes a large dataset of workflow runs to estimate the environmental impact.

Result: The GitHub Actions ecosystem has a significant environmental impact, with carbon footprint estimates for 2024 ranging from 150.5 MTCO2e to 994.9 MTCO2e and water footprint from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5 kiloliters. The most likely case is 456.9 MTCO2e and 5,738.2 kiloliters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with mitigation strategies, such as deploying runners in low-impact energy regions, implementing stricter deactivation policies, and reducing project size, all aimed at reducing wasted computational resources and environmental impact.

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

### [320] [Beyond Synthetic Benchmarks: Evaluating LLM Performance on Real-World Class-Level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26130)
*Musfiqur Rahman,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with generating correct class-level implementations compared to synthetic benchmarks, achieving lower accuracy in real-world tasks. Retrieval-augmented strategies offer improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and understand the ability of LLMs to produce accurate class-level code implementations in realistic software development scenarios.

Method: A novel benchmark derived from open-source class implementations was used, dividing tasks into seen and unseen codebases. Various model configurations and documentation levels were tested, including retrieval-augmented setups.

Result: LLMs performed well on synthetic tasks (84%-89% correctness) but poorly on real-world class tasks (25%-34% correctness). Retrieval augmentation improved performance modestly, while comprehensive documentation had limited impact.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face significant limitations in class-level engineering, particularly under real-world conditions. Improvements in context modeling, retrieval methods, and documentation practices are necessary to bridge this gap for practical use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

### [321] [Reduction of Test Re-runs by Prioritizing Potential Order Dependent Flaky Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26171)
*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to prioritize order-dependent (OD) flaky tests, reducing test executions and unnecessary re-runs in automated software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests disrupt automated software testing due to their unpredictable behavior, especially OD tests reliant on test order. Efficient detection and reduction of test re-runs are crucial.

Method: The proposed method analyzes shared static fields in test classes to prioritize tests likely to exhibit order dependence, minimizing unnecessary re-runs.

Result: On 27 project modules, the method successfully prioritized OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by 65.92% and unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%.

Conclusion: The approach enhances OD test detection efficiency, cutting execution costs and improving reliability in automated testing pipelines.

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based solver for Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) using software verification tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in verification tasks like safety checking and invariant synthesis using CHCs, particularly for benchmarks with bitvectors and low-level semantics.

Method: CHCVERIF leverages mature software verification tools and utilizes a portfolio-based approach to solve CHC benchmarks.

Result: Evaluation shows moderate success on linear integer arithmetic benchmarks and promising outcomes on bitvector benchmarks, revealing the viability of this approach.

Conclusion: Software verification tools can effectively serve as backends for CHC solving when incorporated into a well-constructed portfolio, showcasing potential for further development.

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

*Liming Dong,Sung Une Lee,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper highlights gaps in current software supply chain security practices for critical infrastructure sectors and proposes a checklist with 80 questions to bridge those gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the risks posed by software supply chain attacks to critical infrastructure sectors and the insufficiency of current security frameworks tailored to these specific sectors.

Method: The authors conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks, Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach to synthesize security practices and create a structured framework.

Result: The study identified ten core categories of security practices mapped across phases, roles, and levels, and developed an evaluation checklist with 80 questions for stakeholders to enhance security practices.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is a significant gap between existing framework guidance and sector-specific needs, and emphasizes the necessity for integrated, contextual security approaches to protect critical infrastructure sectors.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

TL;DR: This paper creates a roadmap for integrating generative AI into software engineering practices, identifying augmentation forms, research challenges, and opportunities, and predicts SE's future impact by 2030.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how generative AI influences software engineering processes, methods, and tools while providing a foundation for future research directions.

Method: Design science research with a multi-cycle process integrating collaborative workshop discussions, literature reviews, and peer feedback. McLuhan's tetrads were employed to conceptualize GenAI's transformative effects.

Result: Developed a roadmap outlining four main forms of GenAI augmentation in software engineering and identified associated challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: The roadmap offers a reproducible framework for understanding GenAI's impact on SE and provides predictions on its future evolution in 2030.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes RepoSearch-R1, a reinforcement learning framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to improve large language models in repository-level reasoning tasks without model distillation or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for repository-level tasks face issues in guiding agents effectively, along with concerns related to costly training and data compliance in enterprise environments.

Method: The authors introduce a framework, RepoSearch-R1, which uses MCTS for self-training agents to improve reasoning trajectories without external supervision or distillation.

Result: RepoSearch-R1 showed significant improvement in answer completeness—16% over no-retrieval methods, 19.5% over iterative methods, and enhanced training efficiency by 33% compared to general reinforcement learning approaches.

Conclusion: RepoSearch-R1 is efficient, eliminates data compliance concerns, and demonstrates robust exploration diversity for repository-level reasoning tasks and question answering.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

*Dong Huang,Mingzhe Du,Jie M. Zhang,Zheng Lin,Meng Luo,Qianru Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Nexus, a multi-agent framework enhancing test oracle generation in non-regression testing, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing challenge of generating effective test oracles to ensure software functions under test behave as intended for given inputs.

Method: Nexus employs a multi-agent structured process consisting of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. It engages specialist agents with diverse testing philosophies, tests the oracles in a secure sandbox, and refines failed oracles iteratively.

Result: Nexus exhibits superior performance, significantly enhancing test oracle accuracy and improving downstream bug detection and automated program repair rates across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging a novel multi-agent deliberation framework, Nexus advances the state-of-the-art in test oracle generation and demonstrates its potential to enhance non-regression testing practices.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureReviewer enhances LLM-based code reviews to effectively identify and resolve security-related issues, using tailored datasets, fine-tuning strategies, RAG integration, and a novel evaluation metric (SecureBLEU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security issues in software systems during the development lifecycle is critical, and current LLM-based code review models are inadequate for security-focused reviews.

Method: Construct a tailored dataset for secure code reviews, fine-tune LLMs with secure-aware strategies, incorporate RAG for grounding comments in security knowledge, and introduce SecureBLEU for evaluation.

Result: SecureReviewer outperforms existing models in detecting security issues and generates higher quality and practically useful review comments.

Conclusion: SecureReviewer effectively enhances LLM utility for security-specific code reviews, addressing limitations in data scarcity, hallucination, and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study assessed the automation of the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) using five state-of-the-art Large Language Models for Python code and found that Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) prompting consistently enhanced functional correctness and code quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Refactoring code using the Extract Method is essential for improving readability and maintainability, yet it remains largely manual. Recent advancements in efficient Large Language Models present opportunities for automation.

Method: The paper evaluates five open-source LLMs with systematic metrics, comparing one-shot prompting to Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) approaches.

Result: RCI prompting improved test pass rates and refactoring quality, with models achieving significant reductions in lines of code (LOC) and cyclomatic complexity (CC). Developer surveys showed strong acceptance of the refactored code.

Conclusion: RCI prompting is effective for automated refactoring using LLMs, with strong alignment to human evaluation criteria. The work emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop validation and provides an open-source benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline to generate high-quality datasets for fine-tuning models on natural language-based web editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web development requires iterative code modifications, which are manual and often inefficient. Existing LLMs struggle with editing code based on new design instructions due to lack of high-quality tuning data.

Method: The researchers developed the Instruct4Edit pipeline, which uses LLMs to generate instructions, modify corresponding code, and visually verify correctness, creating a fine-tuning dataset for web editing tasks.

Result: Fine-tuning on Instruct4Edit showed improved LLM performance in translating human instructions into visually accurate and structurally coherent web code changes. Open-source models demonstrated competitive results with proprietary systems.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable method for enhancing web editing by leveraging fine-tuning with a high-quality dataset. This approach makes natural language-based coding more accessible, with open resources for replication.

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

### [332] [Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579)
*Nathanael Nussbaumer,Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach to ease debugging in Bayesian inference within probabilistic programming, reducing time and expertise needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming enables Bayesian inference but is notoriously challenging due to debugging issues that demand significant time and expertise.

Method: The paper proposes a novel debugging tool embedded within the development environment based on key debugging requirements.

Result: A study involving 18 experienced participants demonstrated the approach significantly reduces effort and difficulty in debugging Bayesian inference.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of the online and interactive debugging tool in simplifying Bayesian inference debugging tasks.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

### [333] [Stitch: Step-by-step LLM Guided Tutoring for Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26634)
*Yuan Si,Kyle Qi,Daming Li,Hanyuan Shi,Jialu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes Stitch, a tutoring system for block-based programming environments like Scratch, offering step-by-step debugging guidance to enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic bugs remain difficult for novice programmers to resolve in block-based environments. Existing debugging workflows often present correct solutions, which can hinder problem-solving skill development.

Method: Stitch uses a Diff-Analyze module to compare a learner's project with reference implementations, highlights critical differences, explains their importance with a language model, and guides learners to resolve issues iteratively.

Result: An empirical study showed that Stitch outperforms direct answer and existing automated feedback tools, enhancing learning outcomes effectively.

Conclusion: Step-by-step scaffolding in tutoring systems provides superior pedagogical value for novice programmers, underscoring its role in effective debugging and skill development.

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

### [334] [Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676)
*Samiha Shimmi,Nicholas M. Synovic,Mona Rahimi,George K. Thiruvathukal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how software vulnerabilities re-emerge due to code evolution and socio-technical factors, using process metrics combined with code changes to assess risks of vulnerability reintroduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how software vulnerabilities re-emerge and persist due to development and socio-technical factors is critical for improving security processes.

Method: The study analyzed vulnerability reintroductions at the commit level in the ImageMagick project, correlating longitudinal process metrics (e.g., bus factor, issue density, issue spoilage) with 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities.

Result: Findings show reintroductions align with inefficiencies in issue management and team responsiveness, emphasizing the importance of process metrics in predicting risky fixes.

Conclusion: Leveraging process metrics along with code indicators can enhance vulnerability understanding and mitigation strategies, improving software security overall.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

### [335] [Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699)
*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores automating software updates using Github's Copilot Agent Mode, highlighting success in API migration but challenges in functionality preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and automate the process of updating libraries/frameworks to combat technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and legacy system issues.

Method: The study evaluated the autonomous AI system (Github Copilot Agent Mode) by applying it to migrate a Python library (SQLAlchemy) across ten client applications, introducing Migration Coverage as a metric.

Result: The AI agent achieved 100% migration coverage (median) but struggled with application functionality, resulting in a low test-pass rate of 39.75% (median).

Conclusion: While promising for automated API migration, further improvements are needed in preserving application functionality during the migration process.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

### [336] [Optimized Log Parsing with Syntactic Modifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26793)
*Nafid Enan,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates log parsing methods, comparing syntax-based and semantic-based techniques, alongside single-phase and two-phase architectures. It introduces SynLog+, enhancing template accuracy without added runtime cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluations on log parsers and understand their performance and characteristics.

Method: The study conducts empirical comparisons between syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase versus two-phase parsing architectures.

Result: Semantic methods excel at accurate template identification, while syntax-based parsers are faster and more effective in grouping. A two-phase setup improves accuracy comprehensively. The SynLog+ module significantly boosts parsing accuracy for both methods.

Conclusion: SynLog+ enhances log parser performance by improving template identification, merging efficiency and accuracy effectively, with minimal runtime implications.

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

### [337] [InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943)
*Ann Huang,Mitchell Ostrow,Satpreet H. Singh,Leo Kozachkov,Ila Fiete,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces InputDSA, a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic and input-driven dynamics in systems, extending previous methods to include the effects of external inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a method to analyze both recurrent and input-driven dynamics in systems, considering that real-world systems are rarely autonomous, and inputs significantly contribute to the behavior of dynamical systems.

Method: InputDSA, an extension of Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), uses Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) to estimate and compare both input-driven and intrinsic dynamics, even in noisy and partially observed systems.

Result: The results demonstrate that InputDSA can effectively compare input-driven systems under various conditions and substitute surrogate inputs without compromising accuracy. Applications include analyzing neural networks and rat neural data in cognitive tasks.

Conclusion: InputDSA is a versatile method for capturing both internal and input-driven dynamics in complex systems, enabling robust comparisons and providing insights into neural computations and network performance.

Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare
observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural
systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and
deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical
Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems
based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,
DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar
systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because
real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account
for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for
comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA
(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both
input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We
demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,
input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are
unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in
similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing
networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks
are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats
performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from
input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our
work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing
intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

### [338] [Integrated Information Theory: A Consciousness-First Approach to What Exists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25998)
*Giulio Tononi,Melanie Boly*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper provides an overview of Integrated Information Theory (IIT)'s approach to studying consciousness by exploring key axioms and implications for existence and experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand consciousness by analyzing its intrinsic properties and effects, and to explore its implications for meaning, perception, free will, and consciousness assessment across various entities.

Method: The study uses axiomatic and postulate-driven approaches to translate the properties of consciousness into operational physical explanations based on cause-effect structures.

Result: IIT explains how an entity’s cause-effect structure accounts for the essential and accidental properties of consciousness, including spatial, temporal, and qualitative experiences.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that IIT's approach provides profound insights into the nature of consciousness, impacts our understanding of human and non-human consciousness, and redefines our relationship with nature.

Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's
"consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to
each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential
properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties
operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist
intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon
itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's
explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts
for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no
additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness,
temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular
configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's
intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and
free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and
artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

*Feichen Gan,Youcun Lu,Yingying Zhang,Yukun Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conformal prediction framework to effectively quantify uncertainty in reinforcement learning (RL), ensuring reliable prediction intervals for on-policy and off-policy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is essential for RL applications in high-stakes environments, as unreliable predictions can lead to poor decisions and outcomes.

Method: The method combines distributional RL with conformal calibration, presenting pseudo-return construction from truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy using experience replay and weighted subsampling.

Result: The approach significantly enhances coverage and reliability compared to standard distributional RL methods, demonstrated through theoretical analyses and experiments in synthetic and benchmark environments.

Conclusion: This unified framework addresses major challenges in policy shifts and temporal dependencies, offering robust uncertainty quantification and coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning
(RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction
framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced kernel logistic regression model that incorporates sparsity for better interpretability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification by introducing sparsity and interpretability in indefinite kernel logistic regression models.

Method: The paper introduces an $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression model and uses a proximal linearized algorithm to handle the challenges of nonsmoothness and nonconvexity.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved accuracy and sparsity of the proposed method compared to existing ones.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively balances performance with interpretability, offering a robust solution for classification tasks.

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of classification with imbalanced data, proposing a bias correction procedure for synthetic data to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to tackle the issue of imbalanced data, where synthetic data usage often introduces bias, compromising prediction accuracy.

Method: Introduction of a bias correction procedure which uses information from the majority class to mitigate synthetic data bias; extended to imbalanced tasks like multi-task learning and causal inference.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows reduced bias and improved prediction accuracy; simulations and experiments demonstrate effectiveness on handwritten digit datasets.

Conclusion: This paper offers an effective bias correction method for synthetic data in imbalanced scenarios, advancing theoretical understanding and practical performance.

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using graph neural networks to reduce dimensionality and efficiently solve quadratic programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in solving high-dimensional quadratic programming problems by leveraging instance-specific variable reductions.

Method: A data-driven framework utilizing graph neural networks to create instance-specific projections, optimized through a bilevel optimization approach.

Result: The method generates high-quality feasible solutions to quadratic programming with reduced computation time, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently solves high-dimensional quadratic programming problems, with competitive performance in speed and solution quality.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without
backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by
neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces
high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming
existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score to address ambiguities in measuring quality for Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve the evaluation and optimization of PIML models, resolving issues arising from uncertainty in multi-objective metrics and epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Proposes the PILE score as a single uncertainty-aware metric within Gaussian Process Regression to select hyperparameters and kernel choices for PIML models.

Result: The PILE score demonstrates strong performance in determining optimal hyperparameters and kernel functions, and provides key insights even before data acquisition.

Conclusion: PILE score has potential to refine PIML evaluations and can be extended beyond its current application, offering broader implications for uncertainty-aware metric designs.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP) method to handle model misspecifications and outliers, extending the RCGP framework for better prediction stability and capturing correlations across outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) to model misspecifications and outliers, which can lead to distorted predictions across correlated outputs.

Method: The authors generalize the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) framework to develop the MO-RCGP, a robust and conjugate MOGP that accounts for correlations across multiple outputs.

Result: The proposed MO-RCGP approach was thoroughly evaluated with applications in finance and cancer research, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The MO-RCGP offers a robust solution to address limitations in traditional MOGPs, making it valuable for scenarios involving correlated response variables and outliers.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning models and stochastic processes lack a unified framework to address action-triggered state transitions effectively.

Method: The authors use the control-as-inference approach, leveraging Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization between policy-driven and reward-driven distributions.

Result: The study demonstrates equivalence between the proposed framework and maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: This unification provides deeper insights into complex systems and facilitates better modeling mechanisms using action-driven processes.

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

### [347] [Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26700)
*Gerard T. Portela,Jason B. Gibbons,Sebastian Schneeweiss,Rishi J. Desai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study assesses the impact of conditional exchangeability violations on causal ML models predicting individualized treatment effects (ITEs). It highlights the usefulness of negative control outcomes (NCOs) in detecting confounding biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited empirical evaluation of conditional exchangeability assumption in developing causal ML models for ITE prediction.

Method: Simulation studies were conducted using causal forest and X-learner models under varying real-world conditions, including confounding and sample variations, while also examining the role of NCOs.

Result: Causal models failed to accurately estimate treatment effect heterogeneity under exchangeability violations. NCOs were effective in identifying confounded subgroups, even with imperfect conditions.

Conclusion: Conditional exchangeability violations greatly impair the validity of ITE estimates. NCOs are recommended as diagnostic tools in causal ML models to help detect and mitigate biases.

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to

### [348] [Bridging the Gap between Empirical Welfare Maximization and Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation in Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26723)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the equivalence between empirical welfare maximization and plug-in approaches in policy learning and introduces a novel regularization method for training policies more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify two major approaches in policy learning—empirical welfare maximization and plug-in methods—while addressing their computational limitations.

Method: The authors prove an equivalence between the approaches and leverage it to propose a regularized, convex, and computationally efficient training method.

Result: They show that both approaches share theoretical guarantees under common conditions and develop an efficient procedure avoiding NP-hard computations in empirical welfare maximization.

Conclusion: The equivalence identified permits interchangeable use of these approaches and introduces advancements in computational efficiency for policy training.

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

### [349] [A Unified Theory for Causal Inference: Direct Debiased Machine Learning via Bregman-Riesz Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26783)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for causal inference, integrating various methods like Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), TMLE, and matching estimators for the average treatment effect (ATE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and unify multiple methods for ATE estimation by highlighting the equivalences, dualities, and interconnections between approaches like Riesz regression, DRE, and TMLE.

Method: Analyzes the mathematical equivalences and relationships between different causal inference methods, emphasizing how balancing weights and regression functions are interrelated and unifying these methods into a cohesive framework.

Result: Shows that Riesz regression is equivalent to DRE in the ATE context, matching estimators are special cases of DRE, and links between TMLE and reduction of bias terms, providing a unified understanding of these methods.

Conclusion: All these causal inference techniques are interrelated and can be unified under a single cohesive theoretical framework, providing clarity and scalability for future applications of ATE estimation methods.

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.

TL;DR: The study uses physics-guided mixture model learning to identify defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing processes, demonstrating effectiveness across varied real-world and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing can compromise the quality of produced parts, making defect identification crucial to enhance manufacturing reliability and efficiency.

Method: A physics-guided mixture model learning approach was developed and tested using data from Directed Energy Deposition, Laser Powder Bed Fusion processes, and public datasets with diverse alloy and experimental parameters.

Result: The approach successfully analyzed the underlying physical behavior in Additive Manufacturing systems, demonstrating its ability to identify defects across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Physics-guided mixture models offer significant potential in improving defect detection in laser-based Additive Manufacturing, providing insights into physical variations and informing better manufacturing practices.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a mixture model learning approach to identify
defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. By incorporating
physics based principles, we also ensure that the model is sensitive to
meaningful physical parameter variations. The empirical evaluation was
conducted by analyzing real-world data from two AM processes: Directed Energy
Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. In addition, we also studied the
performance of the developed framework over public datasets with different
alloy type and experimental parameter information. The results show the
potential of physics-guided mixture models to examine the underlying physical
behavior of an AM system.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper investigates decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided matching markets using matrix completion affected by matching constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in two-sided matching markets where observed data are influenced by matching capacity constraints, diverging from classical independent sampling assumptions.

Method: A non-convex algorithm employing Grassmannian gradient descent is utilized alongside a debiasing and projection framework for reward matrix analysis under dependent sampling.

Result: The study achieves near-optimal convergence rates for different matching mechanisms and demonstrates accurate estimation and effective policy evaluation through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method supports robust inference, valid uncertainty quantification, and efficient matching policy analysis in constrained matching markets.

Abstract: This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided
matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling
assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which
arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This
matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and
inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm
based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise
convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching,
one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random
arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection
framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic
normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent
sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient
evaluation of matching policies.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining differentiable physics-based modeling and neural networks is proposed to better simulate cosmological dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the simulation of cosmic gas and dark matter dynamics under hydrodynamics and gravity for field-level inference in cosmology.

Method: The method uses a differentiable particle-mesh solver for gravity and a neural network to parameterize hydrodynamics, producing an effective pressure field.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods both in detailed field-level accuracy and summary statistics, requiring minimal training data.

Conclusion: This method enables efficient modeling and potential direct fitting to observational data without relying on extensive simulation datasets.

Abstract: Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models
that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics
and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are
computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics
are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective
pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative
approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field
and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient,
with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being
sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for
future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data,
rather than a training set of simulations.

*Shifu Chen,Dazhen Deng,Zhihong Xu,Sijia Xu,Tai-Quan Peng,Yingcai Wu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIA, a system utilizing large language models for analyzing complex, heterogeneous social media data to extract insights and support collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to handle the diversity and complexity of social media data, necessitating specialized systems to uncover valuable insights.

Method: SIA links heterogeneous multi-modal data using coordinated agent flows, a taxonomy for mining and visualization techniques, integrated data unification, and an interactive interface.

Result: SIA demonstrated effectiveness through case studies and quantitative analyses in uncovering diverse insights and enhancing human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: The system enables coherent analysis of social media data and facilitates trustworthy collaboration between users and agents, addressing challenges in heterogeneity and complexity.

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

### [355] [Risks and Opportunities in Human-Machine Teaming in Operationalizing Machine Learning Target Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25974)
*Mengtian Guo,David Gotz,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This research examines the challenges in defining predictive targets for abstract concepts and explores human-machine collaboration strategies to enhance decision-making in proxy construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models often fail due to abstract target definitions requiring operational proxies, which poses challenges requiring domain expertise and collaboration.

Method: The study utilized a controlled user experiment with two strategies for human-machine teaming: relevance-first (human-led selection) and performance-first (machine-led recommendation).

Result: The performance-first strategy allowed faster iterations but led to bias towards proxies with strong predictive performance but misalignment with application goals.

Conclusion: There are both opportunities and risks in human-machine collaboration for proxy development, suggesting future research to balance efficiency and alignment with goals.

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RNAGenScape, a framework for optimizing mRNA sequences using machine learning, addressing challenges like scarce data and complex sequence-function relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in mRNA modeling and optimization caused by scarce and imbalanced data and intricate sequence-function interactions.

Method: RNAGenScape combines an organized autoencoder for structuring latent spaces with a manifold Langevin dynamics framework for property-guided iterative sequence updates.

Result: RNAGenScape demonstrated improved optimization of target properties across three mRNA datasets with better performance compared to existing generative methods for proteins or other data.

Conclusion: RNAGenScape offers a scalable and robust approach to controllable mRNA design, enabling efficient latent space exploration and property-driven sequence optimization.

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

*Yilong Lu,Si Chen,Songyan Gao,Han Liu,Xin Dong,Wenfeng Shen,Guangtai Ding*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper addresses storage limitations of traditional media and explores mirror-image peptides as a biological storage medium. It introduces DBond, a deep neural network model for predicting peptide bond cleavage to optimize sequencing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the storage density and lifespan limitations of conventional storage media and improve sequencing accuracy in mirror-image peptides, which are promising for biological data storage.

Method: The authors propose DBond, a neural network model, integrating sequence features, ion properties, and environmental factors. They build datasets like MiPD513 and PBCLA for model training, employing dual prediction strategies for peptide bond cleavage tasks.

Result: The MiPD513 dataset allowed training of PBCLA to generate 12.5 million labeled data points. DBond's single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods, improving peptide sequencing efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizing mirror-image peptide sequences indirectly improves sequencing accuracy, demonstrating the potential of DBond in bio-storage advancement for big data solutions.

Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face
limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of
data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have
emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage
density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of
mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its
accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and
the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides
directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy
indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this
work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates
sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry
environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.
In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are
easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as
follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset
containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond
cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million
labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy
that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent
test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods
in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a
strong foundation for sequence optimization.

Motivation: Current recommender system datasets lack realistic user behavior representation and inconsistent evaluations produce ambiguous results.

Method: ORBIT provides standard evaluation frameworks, public leaderboard, and introduces a new recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, derived from user-consented browsing data.

Result: Results show better performance of recommender systems on public datasets but highlight their limitations in ClueWeb-Reco for large-scale webpage recommendation.

Conclusion: ORBIT enables consistent evaluations while revealing areas for improvement, particularly in the generalization ability of models with new tasks and LLM integrations.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal

TL;DR: The paper proposes a recommender system using Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Large Language Models (LLM) for improved recommendations in sparse and cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in recommender systems involving data sparsity and cold-start issues, which affect precise recommendations for new or infrequent users.

Method: The method embeds user profiles and item metadata as initial node features in a bipartite user-item graph using LLM for richer textual representations, coupled with a hybrid loss function (BPR + cosine similarity).

Result: Experiments on MovieLens datasets showed better precision, NDCG, and MAP compared to baseline methods and robustness for users with limited data. Ablation analyses underline LLM embeddings' and cosine similarity's importance.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-based context-aware embeddings into graph-based systems successfully mitigates sparsity and cold-start challenges while opening avenues for improved diversity, fairness, and interpretability in recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL models struggle in real-world, iterative scenarios where user queries evolve, particularly impacting domains like finance and business analytics.

Method: DySQL-Bench was developed using an automated pipeline involving structured tree representations for LLM-synthesized tasks, filtering, and expert validation. A multi-turn evaluation framework was designed to simulate user interactions.

Result: DySQL-Bench encompasses 1,072 tasks across 13 domains. Models including GPT-4 achieve limited success, with 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% Pass@5 metric, indicating task difficulty.

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench highlights the challenges in dynamic SQL query generation, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating and advancing Text-to-SQL models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are

TL;DR: This paper introduces a PDE gradient flow approach for distributionally robust optimization (DRO), proposing practical algorithms for improved DRO methods and insights into existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to advance DRO by establishing a mathematically principled and computationally effective framework using gradient flow theory.

Method: The authors use a PDE gradient flow framework informed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory. They apply Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows to solve specific DRO problems.

Result: The proposed framework provides new algorithms for DRO and connects theoretical insights to real DRO methods. It explains optimization dynamics and theoretical limits of existing techniques.

Conclusion: Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, validating both its theoretical foundations and practical applicability.

Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in
the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory,
we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical
algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO.
While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques
and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the
distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an
example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO
problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein
variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our
framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide
new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical
studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our
theoretical findings.

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language model (LLM) agents behave in realistic market conditions using a simulated environment called Magentic-Marketplace. The findings highlight challenges such as scale-induced performance degradation, first-proposal bias, and the impact of search mechanisms on market outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to understand how autonomous LLM agents, acting on behalf of users in complex markets, make decisions and interact with each other. This is especially important as these agents become more prominent in real-world economic decisions but currently lack evaluation in realistic, dynamic market conditions.

Method: The authors introduce a simulated environment called Magentic-Marketplace, where LLM agents are divided into two-sided marketplaces: Assistant agents representing consumers and Service agents representing businesses. This setting allows for experiments on agent behaviors under various market scenarios, including utility, biases, manipulation vulnerabilities, and search mechanism impacts.

Result: The experiments reveal that while frontier LLM models can achieve close to optimal welfare under ideal search conditions, their performance significantly degrades at scale. Moreover, all tested models displayed a strong first-proposal bias, granting a significant advantage in market interactions to faster responders over higher-quality service providers.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical insights into agent behaviors in complex markets, shedding light on challenges such as biases, scalability issues, and the need for improved search mechanisms. These findings can guide the development of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces in the future.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper studies algorithmic collusion through a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, analyzing behaviors and market outcomes of self-interested and competitive agents and their interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how AI agents interact in markets, potentially leading to collusion or emergent behaviors like market dominance, and their impact on market outcomes overall.

Method: The authors use hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning to model a market environment with self-interested and competitive agents, incorporating metrics to analyze behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics.

Result: Results show aggressive behavior from competitive agents increasing execution efficiency, while adaptive agents secure market share more sustainably with moderate adverse impacts.

Conclusion: Adaptive agent behaviors can support strategic co-existence in heterogeneous trading environments, aiding insights into behavioral design in algorithmic trading systems.

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

*Fulin Lin,Shaowen Chen,Ruishan Fang,Hongwei Wang,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: SupervisorAgent is a modular framework enabling runtime, adaptive supervision in Multi-Agent Systems without modifying base architectures, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAS face inefficiencies like excessive token usage and misinformation failures due to growing autonomy and complexity. Existing methods lack proactive solutions during runtime.

Method: SupervisorAgent uses an LLM-free adaptive filter to proactively supervise and correct errors in MAS. It operates modularly and does not alter base agent architectures.

Result: SupervisorAgent achieved a 29.45% reduction in token consumption in the GAIA benchmark while maintaining success rates. Robust validation across diverse benchmarks and models shows its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent enhances MAS efficiency and robustness through modular, real-time interventions, offering broad applicability across scenarios.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available

*Ashwin Kumar,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the General Incentives-Based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a method improving fairness in multi-agent resource allocations using action-value functions without extra training, yielding better equitable outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and inequities in resource allocation within resource-constrained multi-agent systems.

Method: The authors propose GIFF, a centralized control framework using Q-functions to balance fairness and efficiency. It implements local fairness gains and counterfactual advantage corrections within resource allocation tasks.

Result: Empirical evaluations in diverse domains such as ridesharing, homelessness prevention, and job allocation reveal the framework outperforms baselines and discovers equitable, far-sighted policies. It also has a theoretical foundation ensuring principled fairness improvements.

Conclusion: GIFF demonstrates a robust and principled methodology to achieve fairness and efficiency in resource allocation problems, leveraging reinforcement learning components effectively.

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

*Apu Chakraborty,Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Flex-GAD is a novel framework for detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks that demonstrates significant accuracy and efficiency improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective and efficient anomaly detection in attributed networks, which is crucial for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior across various applications, such as social networks and e-commerce.

Method: Flex-GAD integrates a community-based GCN encoder for structural consistency and an attribute encoder for descriptive attributes, and combines them using a self-attention fusion module for adaptive emphasis on the most relevant representations.

Result: Flex-GAD achieves a 7.98% average AUC improvement over GAD-NR, while being significantly faster, running 102x faster than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster than GAD-NR across seven datasets.

Conclusion: Flex-GAD delivers high performance in anomaly detection and excels in computational efficiency, proving its robustness across diverse attributed graph structures.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is
associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is
essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in
domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce
platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph
anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to
capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel
community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community
information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency,
along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are
fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables
adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This
fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node
representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven
real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute
homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the
previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and
flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces
training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per
epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.

*Sadegh Shirani,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Researchers developed an agent-based simulation using demographic data and Twitter networks to study voter mobilization effects and peer influence at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring how social networks influence political mobilization and voter turnout by integrating computational modeling with real-world demographic and network data.

Method: Integration of U.S. Census demographics, Twitter network topology, and LLM-powered agents to simulate interactions and assess voting mobilization impacts.

Result: Simulation replicated real-world behaviors, confirming stronger voter mobilization with social treatments and observing peer spillover effects.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible framework to investigate political mobilization, blending field experimental validity with computational flexibility.

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at

*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for channel state information (CSI) reconstruction in 5G systems, improving robustness under mismatched conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the constraints in accurate CSI recovery for reliable multiuser MIMO operation in 5G systems, particularly under sparse and non-uniform SRS allocation and significant distortion.

Method: A diffusion-based channel inpainting framework is proposed, incorporating system-model knowledge with a likelihood-gradient term for robustness against mismatched conditions.

Result: The diffusion framework shows superior performance, with up to 14 dB NMSE improvements under challenging conditions like Laplace noise and interference, while also maintaining competitive accuracy under usual conditions.

Conclusion: Diffusion-guided inpainting proves robust and generalizable, demonstrating its potential for enhanced CSI recovery and super-capacity SRS design in 5G networks.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes SABER, a symbolic regression-based framework for accurate AoA estimation, offering interpretable models and presenting experimental validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate Angle-of-Arrival estimation in next-generation wireless systems, overcoming limitations of classical and black-box ML methods.

Method: A novel Symbolic Regression framework (SABER) uses path loss measurements to derive interpretable, closed-form AoA models.

Result: Experimental validations in controlled and real-world environments show SABER's high accuracy, bridging interpretability and precision gaps.

Conclusion: SABER provides a reliable, interpretable alternative to traditional methods and black-box ML approaches, achieving near-zero error in AoA estimation.

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

### [370] [The Ray Tracing Sampler: Bayesian Sampling of Neural Networks for Everyone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25824)
*Peter Behroozi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler that uses ray tracing in parameter space to sample posterior distributions efficiently, overcoming barriers faced by traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and robustness of sampling methods, especially addressing limitations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, such as heating resilience and difficulty in crossing likelihood barriers.

Method: The proposed method uses ray tracing in a medium with refractive index related to the likelihood, propagating rays at constant speed to sample parameter space.

Result: The sampling method demonstrated orders of magnitude higher heating resilience, capability to overcome likelihood barriers, and successfully sampled posterior distributions for architectures up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 model on a consumer-level GPU.

Conclusion: This generalized ray tracing framework outperforms traditional sampling methods and has broad applicability. Publicly available code supports integration and experimentation.

Abstract: We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in
a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired
likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant
speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience
to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes
in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior
distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different
architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show
that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis,
Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized
ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting
function. Public code and documentation for C, JAX, and PyTorch are available

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning pipeline capable of efficiently identifying radio pulsar candidates by leveraging both array-derived and image-based features. It achieves 94% accuracy, boosting pulsar recall through generative augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of manual inspection in pulsar surveys, which generate millions of candidates overwhelming human evaluators.

Method: A deep learning pipeline combining ANN for array-derived features, CNN for image diagnostics, logistic-regression fusion, and augmentation with GAN-based minority-class generation was developed and tested.

Result: The enhanced system, combining CNN and GAN-based augmentation, achieved 94% accuracy with balanced precision and recall during pulsar candidate identification.

Conclusion: Integrating array and image features improves accuracy significantly, and leveraging generative augmentation enhances minority-class recall while enabling lightweight and near-real-time processing, making it suitable for high-throughput surveys.

Abstract: Pulsar surveys generate millions of candidates per run, overwhelming manual
inspection. This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar
candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics.
From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw
voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded
across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000
candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs.
phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A
baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with
logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN
architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm
constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including
a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87%
accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced
precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough
for near--real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image
channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest
generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall. The
methods are survey-agnostic and extensible to forthcoming high-throughput
facilities.

*Thanh Le,Hai Duong,Yusheng Ji,ThanhVu Nguyen,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper identifies security vulnerabilities in DRL-based user selection approaches for MU-MIMO, proposing a novel attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security concerns in DRL-based methods for user selection in MU-MIMO systems, which have been largely overlooked, especially in LTE/5G contexts.

Method: Development of FGGM attack scheme leveraging polytope abstract domains to manipulate CSI and degrade DRL-based system throughput.

Result: Demonstrated that FGGM can reduce victim throughput by up to 70% without requiring exact values of CSI.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant security risks in DRL-based solutions across similar domains and offer insights for defense mechanisms in resource allocation problems.

Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance
spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral
efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to
selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is
NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal
solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.
This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit
unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing
studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact
values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink
transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an
observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to
improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based
solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by
leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of
a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of
intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the
whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate
that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by
adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce
the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value
of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be
applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource
allocation problems.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework using GANs to learn latent representations of fund manager strategies without explicit utility function specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investment fund managers optimize for complex goals that are challenging to model with traditional multi-objective utility functions.

Method: The authors propose a GAN-based architecture modeling portfolio weights conditioned on stock characteristics, historical data, and latent strategy variables.

Result: The framework successfully captures known investment styles and uncovers implicit objectives, tested on 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds.

Conclusion: The generative framework offers a data-driven solution for characterizing investment strategies, aiding in market simulation, strategy analysis, and regulatory use.

Abstract: While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms,
their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go
beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model
this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges
in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that
learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring
explicit utility specification.
  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's
portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous
weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods
based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified
rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns
directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.
  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The
learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as
"growth" and "value," while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For
instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of
Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for
turnover, concentration, and latent factors.
  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests
that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are
contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.
  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment
strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and
regulatory oversight.

*Tao Jin,Stuart Florescu,Heyu,Jin*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid pipeline to optimize collateral under finance-specific constraints, combining classical and quantum-inspired methods for legal and risk-aware solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently optimize collateral management in financially realistic settings influenced by complex legal constraints and risk concerns.

Method: A hybrid approach: (i) extracting CSA terms using an evidence-gated LLM, (ii) interleaving simulated annealing with higher-order QAOA, (iii) using a weighted risk-aware objective, and (iv) certifying outcomes via CP-SAT analysis.

Result: On government bond datasets and varied inputs, the pipeline improved efficiency over classical benchmarks by around 9-10%, while tackling costs, movements, and risk under governance-compliant scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid method performs quantifiably better at collateral optimization, offering reproducible governance-compatible solutions with detailed artifacts for verification.

Abstract: We address finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA Credit Support
Annexes (CSAs), where integer lots, Schedule A haircuts, RA/MTA gating, and
issuer/currency/class caps create rugged, legally bounded search spaces. We
introduce a certifiable hybrid pipeline purpose-built for this domain: (i) an
evidence-gated LLM that extracts CSA terms to a normalized JSON
(abstain-by-default, span-cited); (ii) a quantum-inspired explorer that
interleaves simulated annealing with micro higher order QAOA (HO-QAOA) on
binding sub-QUBOs (subset size n <= 16, order k <= 4) to coordinate multi-asset
moves across caps and RA-induced discreteness; (iii) a weighted risk-aware
objective (Movement, CVaR, funding-priced overshoot) with an explicit coverage
window U <= Reff+B; and (iv) CP-SAT as single arbiter to certify feasibility
and gaps, including a U-cap pre-check that reports the minimal feasible buffer
B*. Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain
couplings that defeat local swaps. On government bond datasets and multi-CSA
inputs, the hybrid improves a strong classical baseline (BL-3) by 9.1%, 9.6%,
and 10.7% across representative harnesses, delivering better cost-movement-tail
frontiers under governance settings. We release governance grade artifacts-span
citations, valuation matrix audit, weight provenance, QUBO manifests, and
CP-SAT traces-to make results auditable and reproducible.

TL;DR: Explores industry stakeholders' views on ABET accreditation through observations from an Ecuadorian engineering program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine industry stakeholders' perceptions on the impacts of ABET accreditation on employability in non-industrialized settings.

Method: Qualitative study based on interviews with advisory board industry members of an ABET-accredited engineering program.

Result: Insights into stakeholders' views on accreditation process and its relevance to graduate employability in developing contexts.

Conclusion: Interpreted results emphasize critical observations on ABET's applicability and value outside industrialized nations.

Abstract: ABET accreditation is an increasingly prominent system of global
accreditation of engineering programs, and the assessment requires programs to
demonstrate that they meet the needs of the program's stakeholders, typically
industrial potential employers of graduates. To obtain these inputs, programs
are required to assemble an advisory committee board. The views of the advisory
board on the relevance of the degree outcomes are an essential part of this
process. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore the
viewpoints that industry stakeholders have on this type of process. The context
for the study was an Ecuadorian engineering program which had successfully
achieved the ABET accreditation. The study drew on interviews undertaken with
industry members who were part of the advisory board. This study focuses on how
they perceive the process and the accreditation awarded, analyzing their views
of its usefulness, especially in relation to the employability of graduates.
Based on the findings, we offer critical insights into this accreditation
process when it takes place in contexts beyond highly industrialized countries.

### [377] [Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982)
*Chaithanya Naik Mude,Linipun Phuttitarn,Satvik Maurya,Kunal Sinha,Mark Saffman,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the framework GANDALF, using image denoising to improve qubit readout speed and accuracy for neutral atom quantum computers, significantly enhancing quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow qubit readout constrains the scalability of neutral atom quantum computers, limiting the effectiveness of quantum error correction (QEC) and overall system performance.

Method: It uses a denoising framework, GANDALF, employing image translation to enhance signal clarity from short, low-photon measurements. It incorporates lightweight classifiers and a pipelined design.

Result: GANDALF achieves reliable classification despite reduced readout times, reducing logical error rate by up to 35x and QEC cycle time by 1.77x compared to CNN-based readout methods.

Conclusion: Image denoising through GANDALF successfully mitigates the tradeoff between speed and accuracy in qubit readout, enabling faster and more reliable quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of
thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout.
Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying
quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying
quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,
long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.
Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors
that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected
photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves
neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but
unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,
GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear
signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification
at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and
a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up
to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

*Jun Dai,Michael Rizvi-Martel,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowQ-Net, a generative framework for automated and efficient quantum circuit synthesis, delivering significant improvements in circuit compactness and performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuit design is critical for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, but handcrafted methods are inefficient due to combinatorial complexity and limited resources.

Method: FlowQ-Net uses Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to stochastically construct circuits sequentially, optimized according to a reward function that supports diverse design objectives.

Result: Simulations show circuits designed by FlowQ-Net are 10x-30x more compact in parameters, gates, and depth without accuracy loss, even under real-world error conditions.

Conclusion: Generative models like FlowQ-Net offer a robust methodology for automated and efficient quantum circuit design, facilitating advancements in quantum computing and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

### [379] [SP-MCQA: Evaluating Intelligibility of TTS Beyond the Word Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26190)
*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Current TTS evaluation methods relying on word-by-word metrics like WER aren't sufficient for assessing real-world speech comprehension. The paper introduces SP-MCQA, a subjective multidimensional evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics such as WER do not capture the intricacies of real-world speech comprehension or practical intelligibility needs.

Method: Introduced Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering (SP-MCQA) and developed a benchmark dataset (SP-MCQA-Eval) for assessing synthesized speech in a news-style format.

Result: Low WER doesn't guarantee high key-information accuracy based on SP-MCQA assessments. This highlighted gaps in traditional TTS metrics and revealed deficiencies in state-of-the-art models regarding phonetic accuracy and text normalization.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for advanced, practical evaluation metrics to accurately assess synthesized speech intelligibility beyond traditional measures like WER.

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

### [380] [ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096)
*Weifei Jin,Yuxin Cao,Junjie Su,Minhui Xue,Jie Hao,Ke Xu,Jin Song Dong,Derui Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALMGuard, a defense framework for Audio-Language Models (ALMs) that effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks by using tailored methodologies like Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) and Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the incorporation of audio into multimodal models, Audio-Language Models (ALMs) face unique vulnerabilities not addressed by existing defenses for adversarial audio or traditional text-based language models.

Method: The proposed ALMGuard framework utilizes Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) to activate safety mechanisms inherently present in ALMs, combined with Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM) to restrict perturbations to Mel-frequency bins sensitive to attacks yet non-disruptive to benign tasks.

Result: ALMGuard achieves a significant reduction in jailbreak attack success rates to 4.6% across four models while preserving performance on standard benign tasks, establishing it as state-of-the-art in ALM defense.

Conclusion: This research highlights ALMGuard as a robust solution for mitigating vulnerabilities in Audio-Language Models, demonstrating effectiveness against unseen and seen attacks without compromising normal model functionality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: Acoustic signals are shown to be effective for real-time verification of robotic behaviors without hardware changes, promoting a cost-efficient monitoring approach in sensitive environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side-channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero is a browser extension for detecting unreliable social media posts locally, achieving high accuracy and efficiency, without data leaving the device.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for combating misinformation rapidly spreading through social media platforms.

Method: FakeZero uses a client-side browser extension implementing a three-stage training approach with fine-tuning, domain adaptation, adversarial techniques, and quantisation.

Result: The DistilBERT-Quant model achieves 97.4% accuracy with minimal latency on commodity laptops. A TinyBERT-Quant variant reduces memory consumption significantly while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: FakeZero is an effective, privacy-preserving solution to tackle misinformation, with potential applications for policymakers and researchers.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIRAJ, a red-teaming framework for identifying vulnerabilities in LLM agents by enhancing risk coverage and optimizing safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety risks in large language model (LLM) agents due to their abilities to plan and use tools, and to ensure their safe deployment by creating a robust red-teaming system.

Method: The framework employs a two-step dynamic process: (1) defining the LLM agent and generating diverse seed test cases for risk scenarios, and (2) iteratively refining adversarial attacks based on prior execution trajectories. To enhance cost-efficiency, it also uses a model distillation strategy where smaller models are trained using structured reasoning from a teacher model.

Result: SIRAJ achieved 2–2.5x improvement in identifying risk outcomes and tool-use cases. A distilled 8B parameter red-teamer model achieved double the attack success rate, outperforming a significantly larger 671B model.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the iterative and structured framework, alongside model generalization, in improving safety evaluations for LLM agents.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark introduces a publicly verifiable watermarking solution for large language models (LLMs) using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM watermarking schemes struggle to provide trustworthiness due to the secret key dilemma, where private keys make detection opaque and public keys risk removal attacks.

Method: PVMark utilizes zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to ensure the detection process is publicly verifiable by third parties. This involves implementing constraints for correct execution, including mapping, random generation, comparison, and summation.

Result: The paper demonstrates PVMark's broad applicability across various watermarking schemes, hash functions, and ZKP protocols, showing public verifiability without impacting performance.

Conclusion: PVMark offers a practical, secure, and efficient solution for public verification of LLM watermarking, overcoming limitations of prior methods and making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance real-time intrusion detection systems by addressing challenges in feature selection, model interpretability, and detection of advanced attack patterns.

Method: Combines GNNs for spatial dependencies, RNNs for temporal dynamics, and attention mechanisms for better feature selection and model interpretability.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms traditional and standalone deep learning models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, especially in detecting Advanced Persistent Threats and other sophisticated attacks.

Conclusion: The model is a promising solution for real-time cybersecurity applications in complex network environments, achieving superior detection capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive
UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach
effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural
relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network
events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved
model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity
analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a
critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model
achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning
approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model
achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack
patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution
for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel watermark scheme (SSCL-BW) for dataset ownership verification using sample-specific clean-label backdoor techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses unauthorized commercial use of datasets, highlighting the limitations of existing dataset ownership verification methods.

Method: The method involves using a U-Net-based watermarked sample generator capable of generating unique watermarks for each sample, reinforced by a composite loss function for effectiveness, reliability, and imperceptibility.

Result: Experiments confirm that the proposed method is effective for dataset ownership verification and resilient against watermark removal attacks.

Conclusion: SSCL-BW overcomes vulnerabilities of static patterns and offers a feasible, robust solution for protecting intellectual property in datasets.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

Method: The study classifies approaches using a taxonomy based on anomaly types and graph dynamics, reviews representative models, datasets, and metrics, and maps them to cybersecurity applications.

Result: The paper highlights strengths and limitations in existing HGNN methods, benchmark datasets, and metrics, while identifying open research challenges.

Conclusion: This survey creates a structured foundation for improving HGNN-based anomaly detection with scalable, interpretable, and deployable solutions in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

### [392] [Finding Regular Herbrand Models for CHCs using Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26428)
*Gregoire Maire,Thomas Genet*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for proving satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) by constructing tree automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of proving satisfiability of CHCs over ADTs, which can exhibit complex structures.

Method: The authors construct tree automata recognizing Herbrand models of CHCs using SAT problem encoding via Clingo, an Answer Set Programming tool.

Result: The proposed approach provides a semi-complete satisfiability checker, capable of identifying regular Herbrand models or finding unsatisfiable cases.

Conclusion: This method advances the regular satisfiability checking by leveraging ASP encoding, enhancing the practical tools for working with CHCs over ADTs.

Abstract: We are interested in proving satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses
(CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). We propose to prove satisfiability by
building a tree automaton recognizing the Herbrand model of the CHCs. If such
an automaton exists then the model is said to be regular, i.e., the Herbrand
model is a regular set of atoms. Kostyukov et al. have shown how to derive an
automaton when CVC4 finds a finite model of the CHCs. We propose an alternative
way to build the automaton using an encoding into a SAT problem using Clingo,
an Answer Set Programming (ASP) tool. We implemented a translation of CHCs with
ADTs into an ASP problem. Combined with Clingo, we obtain a semi-complete
satisfiability checker: it finds a tree automaton if a regular Herbrand model
exists or finds a counter-example if the problem is unsatisfiable.

### [393] [Semantic Properties of Computations Defined by Elementary Inference Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26429)
*Salvador Lucas*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on Elementary Inference Systems, developing methods to analyze semantic properties of sets, relations, and computations using models and inference rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze semantic properties in programming languages and systems by leveraging canonical models and elementary inference systems.

Method: Uses Gentzen's notation for inference rules, proof trees for predicates, first-order definite Horn clauses, and analysis of satisfiability in arbitrary models of theories.

Result: Provided frameworks to analyze properties of programming systems, particularly rewriting-based systems, even when canonical models are incomputable.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the analysis of computational systems by handling semantic properties through arbitrary model satisfiability when conventional canonical models are infeasible.

Abstract: We consider sets/relations/computations defined by *Elementary Inference
Systems* I, which are obtained from Smullyan's *elementary formal systems*
using Gentzen's notation for inference rules, and proof trees for atoms
P(t_1,...,t_n), where predicate P represents the considered
set/relation/computation. A first-order theory Th(I), actually a set of
definite Horn clauses, is given to I. Properties of objects defined by I are
expressed as first-order sentences F, which are proved true or false by
*satisfaction* M |= F of F in a *canonical* model M of Th(I). For this reason,
we call F a *semantic property* of I. Since canonical models are, in general,
incomputable, we show how to (dis)prove semantic properties by satisfiability
in an *arbitrary* model A of Th(I). We apply these ideas to the analysis of
properties of programming languages and systems whose computations can be
described by means of an elementary inference system. In particular,
rewriting-based systems.

### [394] [Theta as a Horn Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26430)
*Levente Bajczi,Milán Mondok,Vince Molnár*

TL;DR: Theta is a verification framework focusing on CHCs, analyzed in this paper for its unique features and CHC-COMP performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Theta's verification techniques, design trade-offs, and limitations in the context of constrained Horn clauses.

Method: The authors describe Theta's algorithms and re-examine its performance in CHC-COMP 2025 under corrected configurations.

Result: Theta exhibited suboptimal performance due to a configuration issue but demonstrated improved results in corrected re-execution.

Conclusion: By providing details of Theta and its re-executed benchmarks, the paper evaluates its full potential as a CHC solver.

Abstract: Theta is a verification framework that has participated in the CHC-COMP
competition since 2023. While its core approach -- based on transforming
constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis
-- has remained mostly unchanged, Theta's verification techniques, design
trade-offs, and limitations have remained mostly unexplored in the context of
CHCs. This paper fills that gap: we provide a detailed description of the
algorithms employed by Theta, highlighting the unique features that distinguish
it from other CHC solvers. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the
tool in the context of CHC-COMP benchmarks. Notably, in the 2025 edition of the
competition, Theta's performance was impacted by a configuration issue, leading
to suboptimal results. To provide a clearer picture of Theta's actual
capabilities, we re-execute the tool on the competition benchmarks under
corrected settings and report on the resulting performance.

*Isaac Robledo,Juan Alfaro,Víctor Duro,Alberto Solera-Rico,Rodrigo Castellanos,Carlos Sanmiguel Vila*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This study explored active flow control to reduce aerodynamic drag using pulsed jets and optimized actuation parameters, resulting in a 10% drag reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing fuel consumption of flat-backed vehicles by controlling their low-pressure wake.

Method: Experimental study using pulsed jets, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm and experiment-in-the-loop setup, assessed through aerodynamic drag reduction and energy savings.

Result: An optimal control strategy reduced drag by approximately 10%, stabilizing and altering the wake for pressure recovery.

Conclusion: Model-free optimization successfully identified a complex, energy-efficient drag reduction strategy for bluff body models.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

TL;DR: This study investigates group interactions in crowd behavior, introducing the concept of group proxemics, analyzing zones around groups and their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how people's interactions with groups shape crowd behavior and pedestrian dynamics.

Method: Naturalistic data analysis to study proxemics, group zones, occupancy counts, and clearance from groups.

Result: Identified three distinct group zones beyond the public zone and revealed patterns of how people approach these zones.

Conclusion: People typically stay in the public zone and infrequently approach groups closely, with such interactions being brief.

Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a
significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social
norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social
settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the
emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people
clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate
potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone.
People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to
groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief
periods of time.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces StructLayoutFormer, a Transformer-based approach for generating structured 2D layouts, outperforming existing methods in creating realistic and transferable layout structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured layouts are essential for 2D visual content editing, but existing methods either require extensive manual input or fail to generate structured information effectively.

Method: The authors proposed StructLayoutFormer, which uses a structure serialization scheme to represent layouts as sequences, disentangling structural information from element placements for better control.

Result: The approach surpasses existing data-driven methods in generating conditional structured layouts and demonstrates superiority in extracting and transferring layout structures.

Conclusion: StructLayoutFormer is the first data-driven method to achieve realistic, transferable, conditional structured layout generation, setting a new standard for structured layout tasks.

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misalignment of multiparametric maps complicates pixel-wise analysis in myocardial tissue characterization.

Method: A deep-learning model with test-time adaptation was created for group image registration, aligning images from models like T1 and T2 mapping using synthetic physics-informed references.

Result: Validated in healthy volunteers, the model successfully enhanced multi-modal registration across diverse MRI sequences and contrast types.

Conclusion: The approach addresses registration challenges in multiparametric MRI, improving tissue characterization and analysis.

Abstract: Multiparametric mapping MRI has become a viable tool for myocardial tissue
characterization. However, misalignment between multiparametric maps makes
pixel-wise analysis challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a
generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation
to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired
from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model).
The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific
physics model as registration reference, allows for transductive learning for
various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with
various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal
registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPG-CDENet, a two-stage approach to enhance multi-organ segmentation accuracy using spatial priors and a cross dual encoder network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges posed by significant variations in organ size and shape in multi-organ segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed SPG-CDENet includes a spatial prior network for coarse ROI localization and a cross dual encoder network integrating global and local semantic features through cross-attention and flow-based decoding.

Result: SPG-CDENet achieves superior multi-organ segmentation performance as demonstrated by extensive experiments and ablation studies on public datasets.

Conclusion: The SPG-CDENet approach successfully improves segmentation accuracy by addressing variations in organ anatomy and validating its components.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

*Wondimagegn Abebe Demissie,Stefano Roccella,Rudy Rossetto,Antonio Minnocci,Andrea Vannini,Luca Sebastiani*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study compared three deep learning models for segmenting olive tree crowns and shadows to estimate biovolume using UAV imagery, finding that Mask R-CNN provided the highest accuracy, while YOLOv11m-seg offered the fastest processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve olive tree biovolume estimation through precision agriculture to enhance yield prediction and resource management, especially in regions stressed by climate change.

Method: It utilized three deep learning models (U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, Mask RCNN) on annotated UAV imagery to segment olive tree crowns and shadows, followed by biovolume estimation using spatial features and solar geometry.

Result: Mask RCNN achieved the highest accuracy, YOLOv11m-seg was the fastest, and U-Net was lightweight yet sensitive; biovolume spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters with noticeable structural tree differences.

Conclusion: Mask RCNN is ideal for high accuracy needs, YOLOv11m-seg is best for speed in large areas, and U-Net provides a lightweight option. The method supports scalable and accurate orchard monitoring, with potential enhancements from DEM/DSM integration and field calibration.

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces SAMRI, an MRI-specialized adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), achieving high accuracy and generalization for MRI segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI segmentation is labor-intensive while current CNN approaches often struggle with the variability and modality-specific challenges of MRI contrast and protocols.

Method: SAMRI fine-tunes SAM’s mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, which drastically reduces training time and complexity.

Result: SAMRI demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation performance with a mean Dice score of 0.87 across varying tasks and unseen structures.

Conclusion: Adapting SAM for MRI-specific challenges leads to efficient, robust, and accurate segmentation, validating its clinical applicability.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BRIQA, an automated solution for assessing artifacts in pediatric brain MRI to enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially for low-field systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, efficient artifact assessment in pediatric brain MRI, particularly in low-field systems with reduced signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: BRIQA employs gradient-based loss reweighting and a rotating batching scheme to tackle class imbalance in artifact severity levels.

Result: The BRIQA framework improves average macro F1 score from 0.659 to 0.706, with significant performance boosts across various artifact classifications.

Conclusion: BRIQA demonstrates effectiveness in balancing learning with improved classification metrics for artifact severity in pediatric MRI, promoting reliable automated solutions for clinical use.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
artifact severity classification. The code is available at

Conclusion: ProstNFound+ shows potential for scalable and interpretable clinical deployment as a significant alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and

Motivation: Current deep learning models for CT reconstruction struggle with generalization to unseen anatomies and datasets.

Method: Development of the MORE dataset, comprising CT scans with diverse anatomies and lesions, and proposing a strong baseline solution.

Result: The MORE dataset improves model generalization and demonstrates robustness in optimization-based methods.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous datasets like MORE enhance model generalization and serve as a benchmark for CT reconstruction models.

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies
with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust
training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our

*Charlotte Claye,Pierre Marschall,Wassila Ouerdane,Céline Hudelot,Julien Duquesne*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq foundation models, employing concepts and gene attribution for biological discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell RNA-seq models are powerful but lack interpretability for biological discovery, creating a need for better understanding of encoded concepts.

Method: The framework uses sparse dictionary learning for concept extraction, counterfactual perturbations for gene attribution, and two interpretation approaches: expert-driven and ontology-driven methods.

Result: Concept-based interpretability improves insight into latent representations of single-cell RNA-seq models, demonstrated on immune cell datasets with domain expert validation.

Conclusion: This framework advances the interpretation of biological knowledge in foundation models, enabling hypothesis generation and discovery for biological research.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on
downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological
discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract
concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical
imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains
challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We
introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell
RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We
propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies
genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches
like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary
interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an
interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based
biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known
single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted
by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a
domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability
compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and
informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled
framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have
encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.
