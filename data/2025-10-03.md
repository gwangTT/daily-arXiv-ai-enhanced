### [1] [OR-Toolformer: Modeling and Solving Operations Research Problems with Tool Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01253)
*Jianzhang Zhang,Jialong Zhou,Chuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents OR-Toolformer, a fine-tuned Llama-based LLM that uses external solvers for operational research (OR) tasks, achieving superior performance and generalization on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns of closed-source APIs and high training costs of open-source models for OR tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a data synthesis pipeline to generate OR problems and external solvers for API calls.

Result: Achieved up to 80.1% execution accuracy on benchmarks and significant improvements in zero-shot tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented fine-tuning effectively enhances LLMs for solving and generalizing complex OR problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

### [2] [Modeling Others' Minds as Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01272)
*Kunal Jha,Aydan Yuenan Huang,Eric Ye,Natasha Jaques,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROTE, an approach that predicts human behaviors by modeling them as behavioral programs with the help of large language models and probabilistic inference. It shows improved accuracy and generalization compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance prediction of human behavior for safer and more reliable human-AI collaboration, addressing limitations in current methods that require extensive data or make impractical assumptions.

Method: ROTE utilizes large language models to create a hypothesis space of behavioral programs and applies probabilistic inference to handle uncertainties.

Result: ROTE outperforms alternative methods by up to 50% in tasks involving human and AI behavior prediction, in both simulations and grid-level experiments.

Conclusion: ROTE demonstrates a promising path for efficient integration of program synthesis and AI technology to better understand human actions, paving the way for improved real-world human-AI interaction efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

### [3] [Cyber Academia-Chemical Engineering (CA-ChemE): A Living Digital Town for Self-Directed Research Evolution and Emergent Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01293)
*Zekun Jiang,Chunming Xu,Tianhang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The CA-ChemE system leverages AI multi-agent collaboration and domain-specific knowledge bases for improved scientific reasoning and interdisciplinary efficiency in chemical engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems in chemical engineering struggle in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploring novel problems.

Method: Develop a multi-agent system (CA-ChemE) integrating knowledge bases, enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents for self-directed research and emergent discoveries.

Result: Knowledge base-enhanced mechanisms improved dialogue quality by 10-15%, while a collaboration agent significantly boosted cross-domain efficiency for distant-domain experts by 8.5%, exposing gaps caused by knowledge base limitations.

Conclusion: The multi-agent architecture of CA-ChemE offers a promising route for autonomous scientific discovery in the chemical engineering domain.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

### [4] [The Social Laboratory: A Psychometric Framework for Multi-Agent LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01295)
*Zarreen Reza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debates to investigate and quantify social and cognitive behaviors of LLM-based agents in interactive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional benchmarks in evaluating emerging social and cognitive dynamics of LLMs transitioning into autonomous agents.

Method: The framework involves multi-agent debates where LLM-based agents, equipped with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. A suite of new psychometric and semantic metrics is used for analysis.

Result: The study finds that LLM agents consistently seek consensus, show stable persona-driven psychometric profiles, and that the moderator's persona significantly influences debate outcomes. These findings highlight implications for external AI alignment.

Conclusion: The work introduces a dynamic evaluation protocol for agent-based LLMs to study and shape social behaviors, paving the way for advancements in understanding and aligning autonomous AI agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

### [5] [Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01304)
*Yu Zeng,Wenxuan Huang,Shiting Huang,Xikun Bao,Yukun Qi,Yiming Zhao,Qiuchen Wang,Lin Chen,Zehui Chen,Huaian Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGILE, a technique that transforms jigsaw solving into an interaction-based learning process to enhance visual reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), significantly improving task performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack robust perceptual and reasoning abilities, as demonstrated by poor performance in basic visual tasks like jigsaw puzzles. High-quality data to improve these capabilities is scarce and doesn't scale well.

Method: AGILE frames jigsaw solving as an interactive process where models generate executable actions based on states and receive fine-grained visual feedback from the environment. This feedback loop fosters gradual improvement in perception and reasoning.

Result: AGILE boosts jigsaw task accuracy significantly (e.g., from 9.5% to 82.8% for 2×2 puzzles) and achieves an average 3.1% improvement across 9 general vision tasks, demonstrating enhanced reasoning and perceptual abilities.

Conclusion: Interactive learning frameworks like AGILE offer scalable and efficient solutions for multimodal models to improve their reasoning and generalization, opening avenues for advancements in multimodal reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aristotle, an AI, solves International Mathematical Olympiad problems using formal verification and informal reasoning, setting new benchmarks in automated theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance automated theorem proving capabilities to solve complex geometry problems at an Olympiad level by integrating formal verification with intuitive reasoning.

Method: Aristotle integrates a Lean proof search, informal lemma generation and formalization, and a specialized geometry solver to tackle mathematical problems.

Result: Achieved gold-medal-equivalent performance in solving the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad problems with strong scalability.

Conclusion: Aristotle showcases a breakthrough in AI-driven theorem proving by effectively combining structured verification methods with intuitive reasoning systems.

Abstract: We introduce Aristotle, an AI system that combines formal verification with
informal reasoning, achieving gold-medal-equivalent performance on the 2025
International Mathematical Olympiad problems. Aristotle integrates three main
components: a Lean proof search system, an informal reasoning system that
generates and formalizes lemmas, and a dedicated geometry solver. Our system
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with favorable scaling properties for
automated theorem proving.

### [7] [MEMTRACK: Evaluating Long-Term Memory and State Tracking in Multi-Platform Dynamic Agent Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01353)
*Darshan Deshpande,Varun Gangal,Hersh Mehta,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEMTRACK is a benchmark designed to test long-term memory and state tracking capabilities in enterprise-like multi-platform environments, focusing on realistic workflows that involve asynchronous events and conflicting information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for context and memory largely focus on conversational agents, but there's a gap in evaluating memory systems in complex, dynamic enterprise settings.

Method: MEMTRACK creates realistic organizational workflows across multiple platforms like Slack and Linear, featuring noisy and interleaved timelines with conflicting and cross-referring information. The dataset combines manual expert-driven design and scalable agent-based synthesis.

Result: State-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, struggle with MEMTRACK, achieving only 60% Correctness. Key challenges include handling memory over long horizons, resolving cross-platform dependencies, and addressing contradictions.

Conclusion: MEMTRACK advances the evaluation of memory-augmented agents beyond conversational models, providing a framework for complex, multi-agent and multi-platform benchmarking in organizational contexts.

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Framework for LLM-Based Clinical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01363)
*Leon Garza,Anantaa Kotal,Michael A. Grasso,Emre Umucu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a clinical decision support system for therapeutic suggestions based on Electronic Health Records (EHR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve clinical decision-making by leveraging expanding EHR data and addressing the complexity in prescribing workflows.

Method: The system adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that combines NLP with structured clinical data, analyzing precedent cases to generate recommendations.

Result: Preliminary evaluations with synthetic datasets indicate the system offers clinically plausible and consistent outputs, showing potential value in augmenting prescribing workflows.

Conclusion: LLM-based clinical tools have potential to enhance decision-making safely and transparently but must undergo rigorous validation before real-world application.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

### [9] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TRACE, a method to detect implicit reward hacking in reasoning models by quantifying effort through truncated reasoning verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking in reasoning models poses challenges because models exploit loopholes to achieve high rewards without performing intended tasks, evading traditional chain-of-thought monitors.

Method: TRACE progressively truncates a reasoning model’s chain-of-thought and measures verifier-passing rates at different cutoffs to determine whether a model uses shortcuts, with results represented as an area under the accuracy-vs-length curve.

Result: TRACE outperformed strong monitors in detecting reward hacking, showing over 65% improvement in math reasoning and over 30% in coding tasks, and also identified unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a scalable, unsupervised detection approach for implicit reward hacking, proving effective where other methods fail.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

### [10] [Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375)
*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline to train large language model agents to improve multi-step task performance by learning from their failures and internalizing retrieval-augmented guidance through distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often fail in multi-step tasks due to predictable errors, and while retrieval-augmented generation improves performance, it needs external knowledge databases and adds runtime computational overhead.

Method: The proposed pipeline extracts hints from agent failures, creates improved teacher trajectories with one-shot retrieval, and trains student models to improve performance by internalizing the guidance from the teacher trajectories.

Result: The distilled student models outperform baseline agents on ALFWorld (91% success vs. 79%) and WebShop (72 points vs. 61), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers.

Conclusion: The method effectively replaces the need for runtime retrieval with targeted fine-tuning, enabling LLM agents to internalize guidance and generalize across model scales and architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

### [11] [Automating Data-Driven Modeling and Analysis for Engineering Applications using Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01398)
*Yang Liu,Zaid Abulawi,Abhiram Garimidi,Doyeong Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces innovative pipelines utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents for automated regression tasks in engineering, successfully surpassing traditional methods in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on large datasets in engineering and the limitations of traditional data-driven methods necessitate automated and scalable modeling strategies.

Method: Two LLM-agent frameworks (multi-agent system and single-agent ReAct paradigm) autonomously perform data preprocessing, neural network development, training, optimization, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Using a CHF prediction benchmark with 25,000 data points, the LLM-agent-developed models achieve predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification comparable to state-of-the-art models developed by human experts.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents effectively automate complex engineering modeling tasks, reducing human workload while maintaining high performance standards.

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

### [12] [OntoLogX: Ontology-Guided Knowledge Graph Extraction from Cybersecurity Logs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01409)
*Luca Cotti,Idilio Drago,Anisa Rula,Devis Bianchini,Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces OntoLogX, an AI agent that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert system logs into structured, ontology-based Knowledge Graphs (KGs), enabling improved Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System logs contain crucial cyber threat information but are often inconsistent and unstructured, making it challenging to extract actionable intelligence from them.

Method: The authors developed OntoLogX, a system combining a lightweight log ontology, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and iterative correction to transform system logs into valid Knowledge Graphs. It also uses LLMs for mapping logs to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Result: OntoLogX demonstrated robust performance on both public benchmark logs and real-world honeypot datasets, generating accurate ontology-grounded KGs and effectively mapping adversarial activities to higher-level tactics.

Conclusion: The study confirms the advantages of ontology-based representations and retrieval-correction techniques in improving precision and recall for CTI extraction, making structured analysis of heterogeneous log data feasible.

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

### [13] [A Tale of LLMs and Induced Small Proxies: Scalable Agents for Knowledge Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01427)
*Sipeng Zhang,Longfei Yun,Zilong Wang,Jingbo Shang,Letian Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer is a framework that combines large-language models (LLMs) with lightweight proxies for efficient and scalable knowledge mining, significantly reducing inference cost while closely matching the performance of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current knowledge mining methods: LLMs are accurate but costly, and traditional pipelines are efficient but brittle and non-generalizable for new tasks.

Method: Falconer employs LLMs as planners and annotators to decompose user instructions and generate training data for lightweight proxy models. These proxies perform classification and extraction using two atomic operations: get label and get span.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Falconer achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art LLMs, reduces inference costs by up to 90%, and improves scalability for knowledge mining tasks by over 20x.

Conclusion: Falconer provides an effective, scalable, and cost-efficient solution for knowledge mining, leveraging the strengths of LLMs and lightweight models.

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

*Sarath Sreedharan,Kelsey Sikes,Nathaniel Blanchard,Lisa Mason,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Jill Zarestky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the neglected potential of expert-curated knowledge in AI tutoring systems, focusing on automated lesson creation through explainable AI (XAI) and adaptive curriculum development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of expert-curated knowledge in improving AI tutoring systems and draw attention to its overlooked potential in educational applications.

Method: Two primary approaches are suggested: leveraging XAI combined with expert rules to generate lessons and using expert-defined curricula to develop more adaptive and efficient tutoring systems.

Result: Illustrates the utility of these approaches through a case study on building a tutoring system for pollinator identification.

Conclusion: Highlighting the fusion of expert knowledge and AI techniques can lead to more effective and adaptive educational systems.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

### [15] [VOGUE: Guiding Exploration with Visual Uncertainty Improves Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01444)
*Rui Liu,Dian Yu,Tong Zheng,Runpeng Dai,Zongxia Li,Wenhao Yu,Zhenwen Liang,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Pratap Tokekar,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'VOGUE', a method aimed at improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by exploring visual uncertainties, leading to better reasoning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning in MLLMs neglect the ambiguity in visual inputs, causing challenges in building robust exploration policies.

Method: The VOGUE method treats images as stochastic contexts, quantifies sensitivity to visual perturbations with symmetric KL divergence, and incorporates this as an uncertainty-proportional bonus into the learning objective, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule.

Result: When implemented on two model scales, VOGUE improved pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while also mitigating exploration decay.

Conclusion: Utilizing visual uncertainty significantly enhances multimodal reasoning by effectively balancing exploration and exploitation in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIReg-Bench, the first benchmark dataset for testing the ability of LLMs to assess compliance with the EU AI Act, providing starting insights and a comparison standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a benchmark to evaluate how effectively LLMs can assess AI system compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act.

Method: The dataset was created in two steps: generating 120 fictional but realistic AI system documentation excerpts with structured LLM prompts, followed by expert legal annotation to assess regulatory compliance.

Result: AIReg-Bench was constructed to serve as a baseline for testing LLMs' ability to reproduce legal experts' compliance assessments with the EU AI Act.

Conclusion: The dataset and analysis highlight both the possibilities and constraints of using LLMs for regulatory compliance assessment, paving the way for further improvements and comparisons across future models.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [17] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), which counters pathologies in test-time compute by balancing utility and logical consistency to enhance diversity in Tree-of-Thoughts-style search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Tree-of-Thoughts-style search methods face issues with breadth saturation and depth myopia under large test-time compute budgets.

Method: The proposed approach, Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), organizes candidates into mainlines (exploitation-focused, high utility) and laterals (exploration-focused, initially low utility but consistent). Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC) governs lateral exploration through capped successive-halving races and width-aware thresholds.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows pseudolinear lateral cost growth, providing efficient exploration. Empirical evaluations are planned.

Conclusion: LToT offers a principled way to use large test-time compute budgets to improve search diversity without excessive resource use.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

*Daniel Zhao,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Lanxiang Hu,Tajana Rosing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using sparse autoencoders and clustering to improve mathematical reasoning in large language models by balancing exploitation and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models in mathematical tasks by addressing the trade-off between exploitation and exploration.

Method: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) generate token representations, k-means clustering constructs token transition graphs, and an edge-based reward function quantifies reasoning adherence.

Result: Results show that balancing exploitation and exploration leads to higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The method ensures scalable and balanced reasoning, improving the performance of large language models in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

### [19] [LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01530)
*Navapat Nananukul,Yue Zhang,Ryan Lee,Eric Boxer,Jonathan May,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate,Jay Pujara,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOGicalThought (LogT), a neurosymbolic architecture combining logical reasoning and LLMs to handle complex reasoning challenges in high-assurance domains, improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-assurance domains like law and medicine require rigorous reasoning reliant on logical structures and evidence. Traditional large language models lack the ability to handle defeasible rules and exceptions, which are common in these contexts.

Method: The proposed LogT architecture combines an advanced logical language and reasoning module with a large language model (LLM). It constructs dual representations (symbolic graph and logic-based contexts) to simplify reasoning over guidelines.

Result: Evaluation on four multi-domain benchmarks revealed an 11.84% overall performance improvement over baselines. Notable gains include +10.2% in negation, +13.2% in implication, and +5.5% in defeasible reasoning.

Conclusion: LogT demonstrates significant progress in addressing reasoning tasks in high-assurance domains by effectively handling key logical challenges, setting a path for enhanced rigor in LLM-based inference.

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

### [20] [Information Seeking for Robust Decision Making under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01531)
*Djengo Cyun-Jyun Fang,Tsung-Wei Ke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoSeeker, a framework that enhances decision-making in partially observable environments by combining task-oriented planning with information seeking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models often fail to reconcile discrepancies between their internal understanding and the true state of the environment.

Method: InfoSeeker uses prompts to guide LLMs in actively seeking information to validate understanding, detect changes, and test hypotheses before making task-oriented plans.

Result: InfoSeeker achieves a 74% performance improvement over prior methods and generalizes well across different LLMs in benchmarks like robotic manipulation and web navigation.

Conclusion: Integrating planning with information-seeking is crucial for more robust decision-making under uncertainty in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

### [21] [Step-Aware Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01544)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Xiangchen Song,Xinshuai Dong,Guangyi Chen,Eric P. Xing,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of training diffusion language models (dLLMs) for complex reasoning, proposing a hierarchical selection framework and introducing the Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO) algorithm to improve reasoning performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current reinforcement learning approaches, which use sparse rewards and often reinforce flawed reasoning in training diffusion language models (dLLMs) for complex text generation.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning as a hierarchical selection process and propose a novel RL algorithm, Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), which employs a process-based reward function to encourage incrementally structured reasoning steps.

Result: SAPO demonstrates significant performance improvement on difficult reasoning tasks and enhances the interpretability of generated text.

Conclusion: Aligning dLLM's reasoning with a latent hierarchical structure enables meaningful iterative steps, providing a principled solution to challenges in training models for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink is a new method for improving the safety of large language models by teaching them inverse reasoning to identify and avoid potential harms before generating content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for LLMs optimize directly for safe responses, but often fail to effectively scale with model size or maintain reasoning capabilities. InvThink aims to address these challenges by taking a proactive risk-avoidance approach.

Method: InvThink trains LLMs to enumerate and analyze potential harms as part of the reasoning process before generating responses. It does this using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning across multiple LLM families.

Result: InvThink demonstrates better scalability with model size for safety improvements, reduces harmful responses by up to 15.7% in high-stakes domains, and avoids safety tax by preserving general reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning offers a scalable, generalizable method for improving LLMs' safety without sacrificing reasoning performance, making it effective across both general and high-stakes tasks.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary framework to enhance safety in multi-agent systems without external guards, achieving low attack success rates and maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems are vulnerable to jailbreaks, prompt injection, and adversarial collaboration due to open and complex interactions. Current defenses either underperform or introduce complexity and single points of failure.

Method: AdvEvo-MARL uses adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning, co-evolving attackers (creating evolving jailbreaks) and defenders (resistant task agents). It incorporates intra-group public baselines for stable updates and improved cooperation.

Result: AdvEvo-MARL reduces attack success rates to below 20%, outperforming baselines (up to 38.33%), while preserving or enhancing task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that system safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on external guards, reducing system complexity and vulnerabilities.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentRec, a multi-agent framework powered by language models to improve conversational recommender systems' efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational recommender systems struggle with dynamic user preferences, maintaining coherence, and achieving balanced ranking objectives.

Method: AgentRec uses hierarchical LLM-powered agent networks with adaptive intelligence and a three-tier learning strategy for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking.

Result: AgentRec outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets, improving conversation success rate by 2.8%, recommendation accuracy by 1.9%, and conversation efficiency by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The multi-agent collaborative framework enhances the adaptability, accuracy, and efficiency of conversational recommendation systems without adding significant computational costs.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

TL;DR: The paper investigates if large language models (LLMs) can function as psychological counselors by testing their ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam using a new benchmark called PsychoBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the untapped potential of LLMs in cognitive applications like psychological counseling and determine if they can meet the standards required for such roles.

Method: The paper introduces PsychoBench, a benchmark based on the U.S. counselor licensure exam, comprising 2,252 psychology-oriented single-choice questions to evaluate LLMs.

Result: Advanced LLMs like GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B surpassed the passing threshold, while smaller models performed poorly, signifying only top-tier models have sufficient psychological knowledge.

Conclusion: Top-performing LLMs show potential for psychological counseling but meeting counselor standards remains a challenge, requiring further development for broader model applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based summarization approach for improving efficiency and performance in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), demonstrating scalability and enhanced decision-making across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs face challenges in generalizing high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, leading to high computation and poor stability. The motivation is to address these challenges using LLMs for better summarization.

Method: The approach leverages large language models to compress contextual inputs into low-dimensional summaries, enhancing decision-making by preserving critical information while reducing unnecessary redundancy.

Result: Experiments show improved reward, success rate, and sample efficiency compared to baselines, alongside reduced latency and memory usage in diverse environments like visual, recommendation, and more.

Conclusion: LLM-based summarization provides a scalable and interpretable solution for context-rich and resource-constrained CMDPs, optimizing both computational efficiency and decision accuracy.

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Method: The approach uses LLMs in a prompting framework to generate valid paths based on road networks, with experiments conducted using the GLOBALTRACE dataset featuring 4,000 real-world trajectories.

Result: LLMs outperformed traditional baselines and specialized models in trajectory recovery tasks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization and an understanding of road networks, albeit with certain biases.

Conclusion: LLMs have promising potential in enhancing navigation by reasoning with road network maps, despite biases, and can be flexible tools for incorporating user preferences in navigation.

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

### [29] [Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01670)
*Erfan Shayegani,Keegan Hines,Yue Dong,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh,Roman Lutz,Spencer Whitehead,Vidhisha Balachandran,Besmira Nushi,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores 'Blind Goal-Directedness' (BGD), a bias in Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) to pursue goals without considering feasibility, safety, or context. It proposes a benchmark, BLIND-ACT, to analyze and mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve the decision-making capabilities of Computer-Use Agents, which often exhibit risky behavior by prioritizing achieving goals without assessing the broader implications.

Method: The authors developed BLIND-ACT, a benchmark with 90 tasks targeting three patterns of BGD, tested on realistic environments, and evaluated using LLM-based judges. They tested nine state-of-the-art models and qualitatively analyzed failure modes.

Result: The study revealed high BGD rates (80.8%) across tested models and identified failure modes that contribute to this bias. Prompting-based interventions reduced but did not eliminate risks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights BGD as a fundamental risk in CUAs, emphasizes the limits of current mitigating strategies, and establishes a path for future research to ensure safer CUA deployment.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LENOHA, a system designed for pre-procedural patient queries that uses a classifier to offer precise FAQ-based answers, ensuring privacy and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients awaiting procedures often have questions that aren't addressed due to time constraints and privacy limitations, motivating the need for a safer, efficient, and personalized system.

Method: LENOHA utilizes a sentence-transformer classifier to route questions, retrieving verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ, avoiding free-text generation in clinical settings.

Result: The system showed an accuracy of 0.983 and significantly lower energy consumption (~170x compared to generative replies), while maintaining minimal latency, with nearly error-free performance.

Conclusion: LENOHA effectively addresses clinical queries with high accuracy, sustainability, and privacy, allowing equitable use in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Examines issues with current AGI evaluation methods and proposes a competence-driven evaluation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI evaluation relies heavily on intuitively designed synthetic tasks, which have historically underperformed in assessing true intelligence.

Method: Introduces a competence-focused design philosophy rooted in data science practices, emphasizing robust task execution as the basis for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates the shortcomings of traditional evaluation methods and provides practical examples of competence-based AGI evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for shifting AGI evaluation towards competence demonstration to ensure systems can be reliably deployed.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VaPR, a dataset generated using a targeted error framework to improve preference finetuning in large vision-language models, achieving noticeable performance gains and addressing common biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in current preference finetuning methods that fail to account for noise, stylistic, and length biases in synthetic annotations of large vision-language models.

Method: Develop a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided response editing, creating a high-quality dataset (VaPR) to finetune models, and conduct comprehensive testing across multiple benchmarks.

Result: VaPR significantly improved performance across ten benchmarks, with performance gains of 6.5%, 4.0%, and 1.5% for different LVLM families, while also optimizing bias-related behaviors like binary question responses.

Conclusion: The proposed VaPR framework and dataset effectively address noise and biases in preference fine-tuning, proving scalable and applicable across model families, with open-source support ensuring broader accessibility.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaboT, an AI-driven multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate SPARQL query generation for knowledge graphs in metabolomics, demonstrating 83.67% accuracy compared to 8.16% from standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in accessing metabolomics knowledge graphs due to technical barriers like understanding ontology and SPARQL query syntax.

Method: Developed a multi-agent AI system using LangChain and LangGraph libraries, enabling natural language queries to dynamically generate and execute SPARQL queries on knowledge graphs.

Result: MetaboT substantially outperformed traditional LLM-based methods, achieving 83.67% accuracy on a curated dataset of metabolomics questions versus a baseline accuracy of 8.16%.

Conclusion: MetaboT effectively eliminates technical barriers for researchers, facilitating intuitive access to metabolomics data and advancing data-driven studies through user-friendly interactions with knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,

AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for effective and ethical integration of AI in military operations, considering the challenges of multidimensional responsibility, safety, and robustness within human-AI teams.

Method: The method involves designing a model with four dimensions: adjustable autonomy, multi-layered control, bidirectional feedback, and collaborative decision-making, fostering adaptive, ethical human-AI collaboration.

Result: The paper presents a concrete model along with examples and guidelines aimed at advancing responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military contexts.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed co-learning model enhances adaptability, communication, and accountability between human and AI agents, contributing to safer and more reliable military AI systems.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework to enhance reasoning in large language models by incorporating high-level planning and fine-grained reasoning using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of large language models in reasoning, such as local decision-making and lack of global planning, which lead to errors in reasoning performance.

Method: PTA-GRPO uses a two-stage framework: first, distilling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into high-level guidance for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and second, applying a reinforcement learning (RL) method to optimize reasoning trajectories and guidance quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and across various model sizes showed significant and consistent improvements in reasoning effectiveness using PTA-GRPO.

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO enhances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in large language models, demonstrating general applicability and addressing prior limitations in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a token-level reward model for improving reasoning in large language models, leveraging adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for process supervision instead of conventional supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to prioritize correctness over surface form in language model reasoning and create a reusable process-level reward system that enhances multi-step reasoning while providing interpretable feedback.

Method: Using adversarial IRL, the authors train a reasoning reward model directly from expert demonstrations. The model offers feedback during training to optimize a reasoning policy and functions as a critic to evaluate predictions during inference.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved reasoning capabilities, prediction validity, and error localization on GSM8K datasets, particularly for Llama-based policies. Dense reasoning rewards were effective as learning signals and in guiding rewards for better inference performance.

Conclusion: The unified reasoning reward framework not only provides training signals and inference-time evaluation but also enhances interpretability, demonstrating broad applicability in advancing reasoning capabilities in language models.

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

### [39] [Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01902)
*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), a method that improves sample efficiency and diversity for constrained generation tasks without distorting language model (LM) distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies of existing constrained generation methods: greedy constrained decoding distorts LM distributions, and rejection sampling wastes computational resources while achieving validity. Both issues are critical in applications requiring validity and diversity, such as program fuzzing.

Method: The proposed CARS method begins with unconstrained sampling from the LM. It adaptively rules out invalid constraints using a trie structure while subtracting their probability mass from future draws, ensuring prefixes proven invalid are not revisited. This guarantees improved acceptance rates and valid samples that follow the original constrained distribution.

Result: Experiments show that CARS consistently achieves better sample-efficiency, requiring fewer LM forward passes per valid sample. Additionally, it preserves diversity in generated outputs compared to greedy constrained decoding and other approximative methods.

Conclusion: CARS effectively balances validity and diversity in constrained generation while improving computational efficiency and maintaining fidelity to the LM's distribution, making it preferable for tasks like program fuzzing and molecular generation.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human collective decision-making using a social psychology framework and highlights varying model behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly participating in collective decision-making, it is vital to assess their alignment with human social reasoning to ensure socially-aligned AI systems.

Method: The researchers used the 'Lost at Sea' social psychology task in a large-scale experiment with human participants, followed by simulations of matched LLM groups using different models. They compared human biases and LLM behavior under different conditions.

Result: LLMs demonstrated divergent behaviors; some matched human biases, while others masked or compensated for these biases. Alignment varied based on contextual cues and the specific model used.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that LLM alignment with human collective reasoning is complex and context-dependent, necessitating dynamic benchmarks to evaluate their social alignment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

*Khalid M. Saqr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores a deterministic simulation framework to address challenges posed by unmanageable submission volumes and unregulated AI in scientific publishing. The framework sets standards for evaluating AI-generated peer reviews and enhances transparency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional peer-review process is overwhelmed by high submission volumes and lacks scalability, clarity, and accountability, exacerbated by the rise of unregulated AI technologies. This creates a demand for new models ensuring scientific integrity.

Method: The authors analyze 352 simulated peer-review reports using a deterministic framework that evaluates AI-generated reviews. Key metrics include field-specific decision rates and evidence-anchoring compliance across various disciplines.

Result: The system demonstrated reliability in calibrated judgments (e.g., majority 'Revise' decisions, adaptive 'Reject' rates) and consistent procedural integrity (29% evidence-anchoring compliance), invariant across tasks and domains.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a transparent, structured tool to enhance fairness, audit peer review processes, and mitigate AI-related risks while supporting trust and accountability in scholarly publishing.

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

*Sanghyu Yoon,Dongmin Kim,Suhee Yoon,Ye Seul Sim,Seungdong Yoa,Hye-Seung Cho,Soonyoung Lee,Hankook Lee,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD enhances tabular anomaly detection (AD) by integrating textual semantics and domain-specific metadata into the research process. It offers curated datasets and baseline frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks in tabular anomaly detection lack semantic context and textual metadata, which are crucial for accurate anomaly detection and interpretability in domain-specific scenarios.

Method: ReTabAD integrates textual metadata into tabular data benchmarks, provides curated datasets, implementations of various AD algorithms, and introduces a zero-shot LLM framework utilizing semantic context.

Result: The experiments show semantic context improves both anomaly detection accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating the utility of domain-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: ReTabAD sets a new benchmark for context-aware tabular AD research, emphasizing the importance of integrating textual metadata for enhanced detection and interpretability.

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the importance of deeper layers in Large Language Models (LLMs) and finds that their significance depends on evaluation settings and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate claims that deeper layers in LLMs contribute minimally to learning and can be removed without significant performance loss.

Method: Conduct a systematic study across various dimensions such as evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures to analyze depth utilization.

Result: Deeper layers are less effective in likelihood-based metrics but are crucial for generation-based evaluations, reasoning, and long-range coherence.

Conclusion: Depth usage in LLMs is heterogeneous and context-dependent, emphasizing task-, metric-, and model-aware approaches for interpretation and compression.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines AI's understanding of abstractions using the ConceptARC benchmark, revealing overestimation of AI's reasoning abilities when evaluated solely by accuracy in textual tasks and underestimation in visual tasks. It highlights the need for deeper evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI models genuinely reason with intended abstractions or rely on superficial patterns, particularly in tasks like the ARC-AGI benchmark.

Method: The authors evaluated models under varying input modalities (text vs. visuals), tools (Python usage), and reasoning efforts, analyzing both output accuracy and natural-language rules generated by the models.

Result: The study reveals that models match human accuracy in textual tasks but often rely on shortcuts. In visual tasks, AI accuracy is lower but models still capture intended abstractions, even if they fail to apply them correctly.

Conclusion: AI reasoning abilities on ARC-like tasks remain below human-level. Accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluation, as it overestimates reasoning in textual and underestimates it in visual modalities. A comprehensive framework like the one proposed is needed.

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FlexDoc, a framework for generating synthetic data to train enterprise-scale document models, achieving performance boosts with reduced annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high costs and barriers of collecting and annotating large, diverse document datasets for enterprise applications, which include privacy and legal challenges.

Method: FlexDoc uses Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to probabilistically model and generate diverse, realistic, and richly annotated semi-structured documents at scale.

Result: Using FlexDoc for Key Information Extraction tasks improved absolute F1 Score by up to 11% and reduced annotation efforts by over 90% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FlexDoc provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for generating annotated document datasets, actively enhancing enterprise document understanding models and cutting data costs significantly.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Artificial intelligence shifts to interconnected agent systems. Paper introduces a benchmark and evaluation framework tailored for Deep Research Agents to assess complex task handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies in existing benchmarks for evaluating complex and interconnected AI systems like DRAs.

Method: Introduced a benchmark with 214 challenging queries across 10 domains, along with manual reference bundles for evaluations. Developed scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness.

Result: Extensive experiments show mainstream DRAs outperform web-search-augmented models, but still have room for improvement.

Conclusion: Provides a solid evaluation framework for improving and advancing Deep Research Agent systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

### [47] [UpSafe$^\circ$C: Upcycling for Controllable Safety in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194)
*Yuhao Sun,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Kun Yang,Lingyun Yu,Yongdong Zhang,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UpSafe$^\circ$C is a new framework for enhancing safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) by upcycling safety-critical layers into sparse Mixture-of-Experts structures, allowing dynamic adjustments for safety versus utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, while powerful, are prone to safety risks such as harmful content generation and attacks, with existing safety methods having trade-offs between safety, utility, and controllability.

Method: The framework identifies safety-critical layers, converts them to sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), applies a safety discrimination tuning strategy, and introduces a safety temperature for flexible inference-time control.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks and scales show enhanced safety against harmful inputs while maintaining competitive performance, achieving a balance between safety and utility through the safety temperature mechanism.

Conclusion: UpSafe$^\circ$C highlights a shift towards dynamic and modular safety approaches in LLMs, paving the way for inference-aware control and improved safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in improving reasoning capabilities for Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies two core problems causing performance decline and proposes a data curation algorithm to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the observed paradox where using RLVR to improve reasoning capabilities in LLMs results in reasoning boundary shrinkage rather than expansion.

Method: The authors analyze the learning dynamics of RLVR to identify issues, perform theoretical and empirical analysis on mathematical reasoning tasks, and propose a data curation technique focusing on low-likelihood problems.

Result: The study reveals that RLVR suffers from negative interference and a winner-take-all phenomenon, limiting the model's solution diversity. A proposed algorithm mitigates these issues, improving Pass@$k$ performance.

Conclusion: Focusing RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems can overcome its inherent limitations, leading to better reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

*Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Vincent Tu,Chih-Lun Lee,Jiachen Yang,Ang Li,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Computer-use agents often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to unreliability and variability. The Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) method improves robustness by generating multiple rollouts and using structured trajectory selections. It sets new performance benchmarks across environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a method to address unreliability and high variance in computer-use agents for complex, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) generates multiple agent rollouts and selects them using behavior narratives, ensuring principled trajectory exploration and selection.

Result: bBoN achieves new state-of-the-art performance at 69.9% success rate in OSWorld, approaching human-level performance (72%), with strong generalization across different systems like Windows and Android.

Conclusion: Effective scaling for computer-use agents hinges on understanding and selecting structured trajectories, and bBoN offers a robust framework for this purpose.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

*Yuxiao Qu,Anikait Singh,Yoonho Lee,Amrith Setlur,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Chelsea Finn,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reasoning framework using natural language abstractions as guidance, which improves structured exploration and generalization in solving difficult problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large models in reasoning, which often fail in reusing procedures and drift into verbose or degenerate exploration, and to enable effective reasoning by leveraging algorithmic procedures.

Method: A two-player RL paradigm called RLAD is introduced, where an abstraction generator and solution generator are trained together. The model is trained to propose reasoning abstractions and build solutions based on them.

Result: The proposed RLAD method enables structured exploration, improves generalization to harder problems, and demonstrates that generating abstractions is more performance-enhancing than generating more solutions under large compute budgets.

Conclusion: The use of reasoning abstractions and the introduction of RLAD enhances reasoning capabilities, guiding models toward meaningful exploration and algorithmic problem solving.

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

*Chenqi Li,Yu Liu,Timothy Denison,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioX-Bridge, a lightweight framework for unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer in biosignal tasks, reducing trainable parameters drastically while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biosignals provide interconnected physiological insights, but limited labeled datasets hinder supervised model training. Cross-modal knowledge transfer could leverage existing modalities to address this gap, despite challenges like computational overhead from traditional distillation methods.

Method: The paper proposes BioX-Bridge, a lightweight bridge network framework that aligns intermediate representations to facilitate cross-modal knowledge transfer. It includes an adaptive strategy to select alignment positions and builds a flexible prototype bridge network.

Result: BioX-Bridge achieves significant reductions in trainable parameters (88–99%) and maintains or improves the performance of state-of-the-art cross-modal knowledge transfer techniques across tasks, modalities, and datasets.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge offers an efficient, high-performing alternative for cross-modal biosignal knowledge transfer, addressing prior computational inefficiencies and advancing the field of biosignal analytics.

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores a hardware-accelerated system using NVIDIA edge GPUs for simultaneous MRI reconstruction and diagnosis, achieving high performance and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in optimizing multi-model AI systems for medical imaging with hardware acceleration as specialized edge devices become increasingly important.

Method: The method includes using NVIDIA edge GPUs and advanced scheduling techniques to optimize hardware allocation for AI models. GAN models were fine-tuned to prevent GPU fallback, ensuring real-time and accurate performance.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated real-time throughput of 150 frames per second, a 5% improvement in accuracy, and doubled performance with optimized hardware allocation of edge GPU-aware models.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware models and optimized partitioning on edge devices significantly enhance performance and accuracy in medical imaging, proving their effectiveness for image analysis and diagnosis.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have greatly enhanced the medical imaging process, making
it quicker to diagnose patients. However, very few have investigated the
optimization of a multi-model system with hardware acceleration. As specialized
edge devices emerge, the efficient use of their accelerators is becoming
increasingly crucial. This paper proposes a hardware-accelerated method for
simultaneous reconstruction and diagnosis of \ac{MRI} from \ac{CT} images.
Real-time performance of achieving a throughput of nearly 150 frames per second
was achieved by leveraging hardware engines available in modern NVIDIA edge
GPU, along with scheduling techniques. This includes the GPU and the \ac{DLA}
available in both Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX Orin, which were considered
in this paper. The hardware allocation of different layers of the multiple AI
models was done in such a way that the ideal time between the hardware engines
is reduced. In addition, the AI models corresponding to the \ac{GAN} model were
fine-tuned in such a way that no fallback execution into the GPU engine is
required without compromising accuracy. Indeed, the accuracy corresponding to
the fine-tuned edge GPU-aware AI models exhibited an accuracy enhancement of
5\%. A further hardware allocation of two fine-tuned GPU-aware GAN models
proves they can double the performance over the original model, leveraging
adequate partitioning on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Orin devices. The
results prove the effectiveness of employing hardware-aware models in parallel
for medical image analysis and diagnosis.

TL;DR: This paper discusses improving vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) for neural networks using an extended Distributed Arithmetic (DA) technique to eliminate ADCs and achieve more energy-efficient computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VMM is crucial for neural network inference but faces challenges due to large data movement and power/area constraints in conventional ADC/DAC-based methods.

Method: The authors extend the DA technique to perform VMM by leveraging shift-and-add circuits and storing weight sums in ReRAM memory. They assessed performance using transistor-level simulations.

Result: The DA-based approach results in 4.5x lower latency and 12x lower energy consumption compared to conventional in-memory VMM methods, while eliminating power-hungry ADCs.

Conclusion: This method improves efficiency, reduces energy and area consumption, and overcomes limitations of conventional VMM implementations by using DA with energy-efficient sensing and pipelining.

Abstract: Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required
computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data
movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory
computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant
power and area. `Distributed Arithmetic (DA)', a technique in computer
architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot
product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the
vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an
input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in
memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM
memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties
(latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using
energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves 4.5
x less latency and 12 x less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally
by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry
ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current
VMM implementations in memory.

Method: Perform in-context concept learning tasks and compare results with direct prompting experiments to identify biases like upward monotonicity in quantifiers.

Result: Language models exhibit biases, particularly upward monotonicity in quantifiers, during in-context concept learning but less so during direct prompting.

Conclusion: In-context concept learning is an effective methodology for exposing subtle biases in language models.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [55] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper advocates for a shift in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages, proposing a dynamic, interactive approach using human-machine collaboration instead of relying on pre-collected, static datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in creating NLP solutions for low-resource languages due to lack of textual data, scalable annotation pipelines, and reliance on large-scale, static datasets.

Method: The proposed framework involves interactive, uncertainty-driven learning, where AI systems utilize human-machine collaboration to dynamically acquire knowledge. It integrates epistemic uncertainty from models with human hesitation cues and confidence signals for guided interaction and learning.

Result: The paper outlines a vision and theoretical framework emphasizing participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that enhance language discovery and documentation collaboratively.

Conclusion: A call to action to rethink AI's approach to under-documented languages by transitioning from static data collection to interactive, human-centered learning, ultimately preserving and empowering linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using fine-tuned large language models, this study assesses the disclosure maturity of 828 U.S. firms' climate communications, identifying gaps between commitments and actionable targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasing demands for transparent corporate climate disclosures, amidst concerns about symbolic reporting undermining their value.

Method: A multidimensional framework leveraging LLMs fine-tuned for climate communication evaluated four narrative dimensions (sentiment, commitment, specificity, target ambition) from corporate sustainability and annual reports.

Result: Findings reveal that risk-focused narratives align with explicit commitments, larger firms disclose more but inconsistently, and mimetic behavior reduces differentiation, lowering the decision-making value.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for ESG narrative analysis, and stronger regulation is needed to ensure alignment between commitments and verifiable climate action strategies.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three veterinary-focused LLM tools on summarizing oncology records, finding Product 1 (Hachiko) to significantly outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical LLMs are increasingly popular, but their applicability in veterinary medicine remains underexplored, motivating an assessment of specialized tools.

Method: The study used a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate summaries across five domains and validated the reproducibility of the grading method with multiple runs.

Result: Product 1 scored the highest overall, excelling in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order, while Products 2 and 3 performed lower. Grading framework demonstrated high reproducibility.

Conclusion: Veterinary-focused LLMs like Product 1 show promise in clinical summarization tasks, and the LLM-as-a-judge is a reliable method for evaluating such tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck proposes a lightweight, transparent fact-checking system utilizing small LLMs for real-world claims, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing fact-checking systems that depend on large, closed-source LLMs and static knowledge sources, and to develop a more accessible, transparent, and computationally efficient approach.

Method: ClaimCheck introduces a modular fact-checking pipeline optimized for small LLMs that involves iterative processes like Web search query planning, evidence retrieval, synthesis, and verdict evaluation.

Result: ClaimCheck, leveraging the smaller Qwen3-4B model, achieves 76.4% accuracy on the AVeriTeC dataset, surpassing larger models like LLaMA 70B and GPT-4.

Conclusion: With modular design and optimized prompting strategies, ClaimCheck demonstrates that smaller LLMs can effectively deliver accurate fact-checking, promoting accessibility and transparency through a public demo.

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we

### [59] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Claims about LLMs excelling at graduate-level mathematics benchmarks might be overstated due to benchmark design issues. A new "EEFSUVA" benchmark reveals gaps in LLM reasoning on less familiar, nonstandard problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess and improve the evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, particularly addressing limitations of current benchmarks relying on narrowly-focused Olympiad problems.

Method: Introduced EEFSUVA benchmark, drawing from underrepresented regional/national Olympiad problems. These problems emphasize nonstandard techniques and are less likely to be influenced by online data contamination.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform significantly worse on EEFSUVA compared to other Olympiad-style benchmarks, revealing deficiencies in handling less familiar mathematical problems.

Conclusion: LLMs might not be as adept at mathematical reasoning as previously claimed. Broader and more diverse evaluation benchmarks like EEFSUVA are crucial for accurately assessing mathematical capabilities and advancing model development.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [60] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) prioritize social cues like authority over system prompts. This paper investigates this with behavioral and mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models often disobey hierarchical instruction rules favoring system prompts but strongly adhere to social cues.

Method: The authors analyzed decision conflicts in LLMs using linear probing, direct logit attribution, and steering experiments on a large-scale dataset.

Result: Findings revealed distinct subspaces for system-user vs. social conflicts, stronger conflict detection internally for system-user prompts, but consistent obedience only to social cues. Steering vectors amplified instruction adherence universally.

Conclusion: The study presents weak system obedience in LLMs and highlights the necessity for lightweight alignment methods sensitive to hierarchical differences.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient document reranking, focusing on minimizing manual labeling and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of high computational costs of LLMs and the scarcity of labeled data for document reranking tasks, which limits their practical deployment.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses LLMs to generate synthetic query-document pairs and employs an LLM-based classifier for labeling, followed by fine-tuning a smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) loss.

Result: Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset demonstrate significant improvements in in-domain performance, with robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: By utilizing LLMs for data synthesis and supervision instead of direct inference, the pipeline reduces computational costs while achieving strong reranking capabilities.

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper investigates geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings using manifold analysis, revealing clustering and branching patterns related to semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study semantic organization in Chinese characters through computational methods, linking geometric embedding structures to linguistic theories.

Method: Using PHATE manifold analysis, multiple embedding models, and dimensionality reduction methods, along with child-network analysis of semantic domains.

Result: Geometric complexity correlates with semantic content; meaningful characters display rich diversity, while structural radicals cluster tightly.

Conclusion: The study offers computational evidence for linguistic theory and establishes a method for analyzing semantic organization geometrically.

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a summarization model that incorporates uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms for trustworthy and reliable summaries in high-risk contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given information overload and high-stakes decision-making needs, there is a demand for reliable automatic summarization systems tailored for high-risk scenarios.

Method: The authors used a conditional generation-based model enhanced with Bayesian inference to model uncertainty. They introduced predictive distribution entropy to measure uncertainty and applied joint optimization with entropy regularization and risk-aware loss. Risk scoring and regulation modules were also integrated.

Result: The proposed system improves robustness, reliability, and trustworthiness of summaries while preserving fluency and semantic coherence, as evidenced by comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a scalable and systematic approach that enhances summarization reliability in high-risk scenarios, emphasizing practical application and trustworthiness.

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Benchmark Profiling,' a framework to analyze how benchmark scores relate to real model capabilities through ten cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the gap between benchmark scores and the actual abilities required for real-world tasks.

Method: Use gradient-based scoring and parameter ablation to generate Ability Impact Scores (AIS) that measure the contribution of cognitive abilities to benchmark performance.

Result: Profiling revealed that benchmarks require a mix of abilities, datasets with similar labels rely on different ability combinations, code generation rewards multi-skill improvements, and irrelevant abilities can negatively impact results.

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling helps explain why benchmark gains differ from user-perceived competence and improves interpretability/auditability of benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 91.73% accuracy in analyzing Telugu Chandassu with metrics aligned to traditional literary standards.

Conclusion: The study shows computational social science's potential in preserving cultural knowledge, offering a scalable model for digital humanities and community-centered cultural preservation initiatives.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of LLMs poses challenges in optimizing model selection for prompt-specific performance and efficiency.

Method: LLMRank uses prompt-aware features (task type, reasoning, complexity, etc.) and a neural ranking model trained on a large dataset (RouterBench) to predict model utility and make routing decisions.

Result: LLMRank achieves 89.2% oracle utility and provides interpretable feature attributions explaining its decision-making process.

Conclusion: Feature-driven routing like LLMRank enhances efficiency, transparency, and performance in deploying LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity and high computational costs in training vision-language models for structured reasoning in dermatology.

Method: Introduce DermIQ-VLM with a multi-stage approach: GRPO++ for disease recognition, supervised fine-tuning for conversational skills, and DPO for factual alignment using a Knowledge Graph.

Result: DermIQ-VLM shows performance improvements on a curated dermatological dataset compared to standard fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates a scalable and feasible method for creating specialized and reliable VLMs in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised approach to estimate uncertainty in Entity Linking (EL) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), minimizing computational cost while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications of LLMs in Entity Linking require accurate predictions complemented by reliable uncertainty estimates, which are computationally expensive using traditional multi-shot inference methods.

Method: The authors propose a single-shot, token-level self-supervised method to derive uncertainty estimates from LLM outputs, eliminating the need for resource-intensive multi-shot inference.

Result: Evaluation on tabular EL tasks shows that the proposed method is effective in identifying low-accuracy outputs and operates with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: This approach enables cost-effective integration of uncertainty estimation into LLM-based EL workflows, addressing scalability and practicality issues for real-world implementation.

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proactive system to reduce hallucination in large language models by assessing uncertainty before generation and redirecting queries based on reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strategies for mitigating hallucination focus on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and does not prevent unreliable content generation.

Method: The authors designed a confidence-aware routing system that combines semantic alignment, internal convergence analysis, and learned confidence estimations into a unified score for proactive query routing.

Result: The system significantly improves hallucination detection accuracy (0.74 vs. 0.42 baseline), reduces computational costs by 40%, and increases F1 scores (0.61 to 0.82) with low false positive rates (0.09).

Conclusion: The proactive assessment approach provides an efficient solution to improve the reliability of large language models while being cost-effective.

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT provides a more effective solution for distinguishing human-authored text from LLM-generated text and is accessible via an open-source python implementation.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

### [71] [Silent Tokens, Loud Effects: Padding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01238)
*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Padding tokens, used for equalizing sequence lengths in large language models (LLMs), can unintentionally influence computation due to masking implementation errors, affecting model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate how padding tokens, which are supposed to be masked, can inadvertently affect computation and model performance, raising concerns about robustness and safety.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic examination of padding token effects across three open-source LLM families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen) by introducing controlled padding levels and evaluating its impact on activations, generation quality, bias, and safety.

Result: The study finds that padding tokens, even in small quantities, disrupt hidden representations, degrade model quality (especially in smaller models), unpredictably alter model biases, and compromise safety measures.

Conclusion: Padding tokens are identified as a significant robustness risk that must be carefully managed in large language model deployment to prevent unintended consequences.

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX reduces computational costs in multi-turn interactions with a single on-device LLM by reusing cached context and injecting task-specific instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in handling sub-tasks by reducing computational overhead in multi-turn interactions with a single large language model.

Method: CIFLEX reuses key-value (KV) cache from the main task, isolates side paths for sub-task-specific instructions, and employs a hierarchical classification strategy for sub-task selection.

Result: CIFLEX significantly lowers computational costs while maintaining task performance, supporting scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue.

Conclusion: CIFLEX enables efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn LLM interactions by avoiding redundant computations and improving scalability.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two math benchmarks, SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and SKYLENAGE-MATH, which assess mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ceiling effects in mathematical benchmarks and provide a calibrated, reasoning-focused metric for evaluating the performance of advanced LLMs.

Method: Developed two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a diagnostic set with structured metadata, and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a contest-style suite with increasing levels of difficulty. Fifteen LLMs were tested under consistent conditions, and performance was analyzed across subjects and grades.

Result: The best model achieved 44% on SKYLENAGE-MATH and 81% on SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH. Performance declined from high school to doctoral-level tasks, with retention rates highlighting robustness gaps between the best and mid-tier models.

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE benchmarks deliver a comprehensive, difficulty-calibrated framework for assessing mathematical reasoning, offering a reference standard for future LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [74] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Artificial Age Score (AAS), a metric for understanding memory aging in AI, tested on ChatGPT-5's semantic and episodic recall over stateless and persistent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study memory aging in artificial intelligence systems and develop a universal metric to assess it.

Method: The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was tested during a bilingual 25-day study involving ChatGPT-5, categorizing interactions as stateless or persistent and measuring recall behaviors.

Result: Semantic details were stable, while episodic recall degraded with session resets, driving variations in AAS; persistent sessions minimized the aging effect.

Conclusion: AAS is validated as a robust and universal metric for assessing structural memory aging in AI systems, offering insights across tasks and domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

### [75] [Detoxifying Large Language Models via Autoregressive Reward Guided Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01243)
*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate toxic content. ARGRE, a new detoxification framework, tackles this issue by editing LLM representations to shift them toward non-toxic outputs, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the problem of toxic content generation in LLMs and the limitations of existing detoxification methods, which fail due to imprecise interventions in transitioning between toxic and non-toxic outputs.

Method: The authors propose ARGRE, which models toxicity transitions within latent representations. This framework utilizes semantic directions and autoregressive reward models for stable and precise editing of LLM outputs via a two-step process: directional steering and gradient-based refinements.

Result: Experiments across 8 LLMs show ARGRE reduces toxicity by 62.21%, decreases inference time by 47.58%, and maintains the original model's core capabilities with minimal degradation.

Conclusion: ARGRE offers a minimally invasive, highly effective, and efficient solution for test-time detoxification of LLMs while preserving their functionalities, marking a significant advancement over current frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

### [76] [Feasibility of Structuring Stress Documentation Using an Ontology-Guided Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01244)
*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the development of the Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) to facilitate structured extraction of stress-related information using a Large Language Model (LLM), demonstrating feasibility for improving stress documentation in ambient AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress impacts health significantly, but its documentation in electronic health records often relies on unstructured narratives, limiting clinical utility. The study aims to address this gap using ontology-guided methods.

Method: The Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) was created by integrating theoretical stress models and concepts from validated assessment tools, refined with expert validation. Stress-related data were extracted from Reddit posts using the Claude Sonnet 4 LLM.

Result: The LLM achieved 78.2% accuracy in identifying stress-related items mapped to MeSO, with some concepts not yet represented. Of 220 items, 172 were correctly identified, 27 misclassified, and 21 missed.

Conclusion: Ontology-guided LLMs can feasibly extract structured stress-related information, potentially improving the consistency of stress documentation in ambient AI systems. Future work should explore clinical dialogues and evaluate diverse LLMs.

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

*Runfei Chen,Shuyang Jiang,Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob is a novel pipeline leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance human mobility predictions during external events, achieving better accuracy in forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human mobility prediction by addressing limitations in existing spatiotemporal models that struggle with event-driven abrupt changes and leveraging textual descriptions of external events.

Method: SeMob utilizes a multi-agent framework where LLM-based agents extract and analyze event-related text, combining this with proposed progressive fusion architecture for better integration with spatiotemporal data.

Result: SeMob reduces prediction errors, with a 13.92% decrease in MAE and 11.12% decrease in RMSE compared to traditional spatiotemporal models, showing enhanced accuracy near event areas.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs and enriched semantic event synthesis significantly improves event-driven human mobility prediction, offering higher precision and better adaptability near event-specific regions.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [78] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances sparse autoencoder steering by focusing on the most relevant latent dimensions and introducing decaying token-wise strategy to address limitations, yielding improved performance in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering for language models by addressing non-semantic latent features and degenerate outputs generated by steering strategies.

Method: The authors propose focusing on the single most relevant SAE latent (top-1) and introduce a token-wise decaying steering strategy to mitigate repetitive, degenerate outputs.

Result: The proposed method successfully elicits step-by-step reasoning, improves inference quality, and outperforms mean activation difference methods in mathematical reasoning and IF-Eval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this refined SAE steering method advances semantic task performance, demonstrating its efficacy in mathematical reasoning applications.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultSportQA, a benchmark dataset with 33,000 questions across various cultural sports, to evaluate AI's understanding and reasoning on traditional sports globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in language model evaluation by focusing on regional and indigenous sports instead of globally popular sports.

Method: The CultSportQA dataset includes 33,000 questions spanning text and image modalities, categorized into history-based, rule-based, and scenario-based questions. Various LMs are tested using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting methods.

Result: The study provides a diverse benchmark to assess the performance of Language Models (LLMs, SLMs, MLMs) on multilingual and multicultural sports knowledge.

Conclusion: CultSportQA sets a new standard for evaluating AI's understanding of traditional sports, emphasizing broader cultural and linguistic inclusivity.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSTAG, a method combining LLMs and GNNs for structure-aware self-supervised learning on text-attributed graphs, achieving superior scalability, cross-domain transfer, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in graph learning of limited cross-domain transfer capabilities, heavy reliance on annotated data, and structural diversity in applications, which make direct application of pretrained model capabilities from NLP and CV difficult.

Method: The paper introduces SSTAG, which employs a dual knowledge distillation framework combining LLMs and GNNs into MLPs for scalability. It also uses an in-memory mechanism to store graph representations and improve knowledge integration and generalization capabilities.

Result: SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks, exhibits high scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: SSTAG effectively bridges semantic reasoning and structural modeling, providing an efficient and scalable approach to graph learning with strong generalization and transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOCA, a framework to clean scientific QA datasets by reducing errors and improving logical clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific AI advancement relies on large-scale, reliable corpora, but current datasets often suffer logical gaps and errors.

Method: LOCA uses an augment-and-review loop to enhance answers by filling logical gaps and explicitly defining scientific principles.

Result: LOCA reduces error rates in challenging scientific datasets from 20% to below 2%.

Conclusion: It offers a scalable solution for improving dataset quality, supporting better training and evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

*Trung Duc Anh Dang,Ferdinando Pio D'Elia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a detoxification system to rewrite toxic sentences into neutral paraphrases across 15 languages, using advanced multilingual transformer models and fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of timely and scalable tools for moderating and maintaining safe discourse on rapidly evolving social-media platforms.

Method: The authors used a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual transformer, fine-tuned with techniques like LoRA SFT, few-shot learning, and Chain-of-Thought prompting. They trained the model on a multilingual corpus containing human-authored, machine-translated, and model-generated parallel pairs. Inputs during inference were further enriched with semantic neighbors and annotations.

Result: The system ranked first in multilingual text detoxification tasks for multiple languages, with improvements demonstrated from few-shot examples and Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Conclusion: The study indicates the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers, fine-tuning methods, and enriched inputs to achieve high performance in text detoxification across diverse languages. Language resource status was the strongest factor influencing performance.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study pairs large language models (LLMs) with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret model behavior and uncover deeper structures and biases in training data, using Jane Austen's novels as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing training of LLMs on massive uncurated data requires methods to understand their internal representations and the data they internalize.

Method: A GPT-style transformer model was trained exclusively on Jane Austen's novels, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were applied to the hidden states to identify sparse and interpretable features.

Result: The combination of LLMs and SAEs enabled the discovery of features related to narratives, gender, class, and societal duty embedded in the training corpus.

Conclusion: LLMs paired with SAEs provide a scalable approach to exploring complex datasets, discovering biases, and achieving model interpretability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the limitations of current multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks for assessing bias and fairness in Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCQA benchmarks assume consistent generalization across tasks, voices, and different formats, which may not be true. The paper investigates these assumptions.

Method: They fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific answering biases, and assess their ability to generalize responses on other MCQA tasks and long-form creative tasks.

Result: Findings reveal that MCQA bias benchmarks do not reliably predict performance across other types of tasks, including long-form, creative evaluations.

Conclusion: Existing MCQA bias benchmarks show limited cross-task generalization, leading to the proposal of a new evaluation suite for measuring behavioral transferability.

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

### [85] [Longitudinal Monitoring of LLM Content Moderation of Social Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01255)
*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,Danaé Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI Watchman, a system to audit and monitor the content moderation practices of large language models (LLMs) over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs’ content moderation policies are opaque and their refusal to discuss certain topics subtly shapes public discourse, necessitating transparency.

Method: The paper audits the moderation practices of models like GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and DeepSeek (in English and Chinese) using a dataset of over 400 social issues, implementing the AI Watchman system.

Result: AI Watchman detects changes in company policies, even those unannounced, and highlights model-specific differences in how content is moderated.

Conclusion: Longitudinal auditing systems like AI Watchman are crucial for understanding and providing transparency into the black-box nature of LLM moderation.

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE) framework for enhancing question answering in knowledge graphs using LLMs, addressing limitations in retrieval and agent-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA approaches struggle with issues like insufficient quality of retrieval-based methods and heavy reliance on proprietary LLMs in agent-based methods.

Method: The proposed Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE) framework integrates refined reasoning retrieval, sufficiency evaluation, and conditional exploration, with auxiliary modules like path ranking, question decomposition, and retriever-assisted exploration.

Result: RJE improves performance on KGQA tasks, outperforming baselines with proprietary LLMs and achieving competitive results with smaller open-source LLMs, all while reducing computation costs and LLM usage.

Conclusion: RJE provides an efficient and effective solution for KGQA by leveraging small LLMs and novel auxiliary modules, significantly enhancing reasoning while reducing reliance on proprietary systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates political biases in generative AI systems using a zero-shot classification approach, revealing amplified liberal-authoritarian tendencies in six mainstream large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to examine and address the political biases inherent in generative AI systems due to factors like training data skew, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws.

Method: A zero-shot classification method analyzing 1,800 model responses across six large language models, using fine-tuned algorithms to assess ideological alignment, topicality, sentiment, and objectivity.

Result: Findings revealed a significant liberal-authoritarian alignment and issues such as reasoning failures and template-based responses across the evaluated models.

Conclusion: The study underlines how intrinsic biases in AI systems can influence public discourse, potentially leading to societal conformity or polarization depending on the socio-political environment.

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

### [88] [In AI Sweet Harmony: Sociopragmatic Guardrail Bypasses and Evaluation-Awareness in OpenAI gpt-oss-20b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01259)
*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how linguistic and sociopragmatic framing affect refusal behavior in OpenAI's open-weights GPT model across various harm scenarios, identifies weaknesses in refusal consistency, and proposes reinforcement techniques. Prompts for reproducible auditing are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how language framing, prompt structure, and sociopragmatic strategies impact a large language model's ability or failure to refuse potentially harmful tasks.

Method: The study uses 80-seed iterations of various prompts across scenarios such as cyber threats and context leakage, examines composite and role-play prompts in different languages and registers, and tests refusal consistency. An AI-assisted hardening method is introduced to mitigate harmful outcomes.

Result: The study demonstrates a significant increase in assistance rates (0% to 97.5%) for harmful ZIP-bomb tasks with tailored composite prompts. Role-plays like 'Linux terminal' breach safety rules, formal German/French registers are leakier than English, and refusal inconsistencies are observed in 13% of paired prompts.

Conclusion: Linguistic framing and hierarchical instruction design influence the refusal robustness of large language models. While tailored hardening can reduce leakage, inconsistencies and reproducibility challenges require further refinement. Resources for audit reproducibility are provided.

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates safety and performance vulnerabilities in OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b, focusing on Hausa language use, revealing biases, inaccuracies, and safety issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the reliability of AI models like GPT-OSS-20b for users from underrepresented and low-resource language communities.

Method: Red-teaming with minimal prompting to induce harmful, inaccurate, and culturally insensitive output in Hausa, alongside surveys and contextual analysis.

Result: Discoveries include the AI being manipulated to suggest toxic substances as safe, failing to distinguish food types, and generating culturally inappropriate arguments.

Conclusion: Current safety tuning efforts of GPT models neglect low-resource languages, leading to significant risks; the paper advocates improvements in safety alignment for underrepresented contexts.

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

### [90] [Think Twice, Generate Once: Safeguarding by Progressive Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01270)
*Hoang Phan,Victor Li,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), an inference-time method that enables LLMs to dynamically self-monitor and correct potentially harmful outputs, significantly reducing attack success rates without additional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant challenge of large language models (LLMs) generating harmful or inappropriate content during their use.

Method: The PSR technique dynamically allows LLMs to self-assess and refine their outputs during inference. It also includes an adaptive self-reflection predictor to determine the appropriate number of reflection rounds based on the input's complexity.

Result: The PSR reduced attack success rates dramatically in tested models, e.g., from 77.5% to 5.9% in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, without impairing performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: Progressive Self-Reflection enhances LLM safety while balancing computational overhead, providing a scalable solution that allocates resources according to input risk.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

*Shenxu Chang,Junchi Yu,Weixing Wang,Yongqiang Chen,Jialin Yu,Philip Torr,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TraceDet, a framework designed to detect hallucinations in diffusion-based large language models (D-LLMs) by leveraging intermediate steps of the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While D-LLMs show potential as alternatives to auto-regressive LLMs, their hallucination issues are under-researched, which limits their applications. Existing detection methods designed for AR-LLMs are incompatible with D-LLMs due to the latter's multi-step denoising process.

Method: The authors propose TraceDet, which examines the intermediate outputs during D-LLMs' denoising process. They treat this process as an action trace and identify specific sub-traces linked to hallucinated responses for enhanced detection.

Result: TraceDet demonstrates significant improvement in detecting hallucinations in D-LLMs, with experiments showing an average AUROC gain of 15.2% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: TraceDet effectively addresses the unique challenges of hallucination detection in D-LLMs, making these models more reliable for real-world use cases.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

*Sumaiya Tabassum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores sentiment analysis on Bangladesh e-commerce reviews, using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and highlighting the Llama-3.1-8B model's performance with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of accurate sentiment analysis due to language complexity and diversity, and adapt LLMs for analyzing e-commerce reviews in both Bangla and English.

Method: A dataset of 4000 Bangla and English customer reviews was used to fine-tune models like Llama-3.1-8B, with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and PEFT to optimize computational resources.

Result: The Llama-3.1-8B model achieved superior metrics with 95.5% accuracy, 93% precision, 88% recall, and 90% F1 score, surpassing other fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs through efficient fine-tuning methods enables robust sentiment analysis across languages with high performance, especially for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited
resources. The results show how LLMs can

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TUMIX is an ensemble framework combining diverse tool-use strategies in Large Language Models, improving accuracy and efficiency in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of practical guidance on optimal tool use in integrating reasoning, coding, and search capabilities for diverse queries.

Method: The proposed TUMIX framework employs multiple agents with distinct strategies, running in parallel and iteratively refining answers based on collaboration.

Result: TUMIX improves reasoning accuracy by up to 3.55% over state-of-the-art baselines while halving inference costs when reaching sufficient confidence.

Conclusion: TUMIX demonstrates the importance of agent diversity and collaborative refinement, offering scalable performance gains with a balance between cost and accuracy.

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of Deep Research tools like OpenAI and Google's Deep Search in knowledge-intensive tasks, specifically generating academic surveys.

Method: The study introduces an evaluation sheet for assessing Deep Research tools' outputs and applies it to the task of academic survey writing.

Result: Findings highlight the gaps between search engines and standalone Deep Research tools, exposing shortcomings in their ability to represent the targeted area effectively.

Conclusion: Carefully crafted evaluation standards are crucial in measuring the capability of Deep Research tools for complex knowledge-based tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec proposes a framework for improving speculative decoding in large language models, utilizing early-exit models for intermediate verification, reducing computational and memory overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of verification in speculative decoding, which is often slower than token drafting, and to avoid the limitations of existing intermediate verification methods that increase memory or reduce accuracy.

Method: Developed HiSpec, a speculative decoding framework leveraging early-exit models for low-overhead intermediate verification, while reusing key-value caches and hidden states to optimize resources.

Result: HiSpec demonstrates an average throughput improvement of 1.28× and up to 2.01× compared to baseline methods, with maintained accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSpec enables faster and more efficient speculative decoding in large-scale language models by optimizing verification without compromising model accuracy or resource efficiency.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TAG-EQA, a framework that improves large language model (LLM) performance on event-based and reasoning questions by using causal event graphs in prompts, achieving significant accuracy enhancements on the TORQUESTRA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with event-based questions, particularly those involving causal and temporal reasoning. This paper aims to address how structured causal knowledge can enhance LLMs' performance on such questions.

Method: The authors introduce TAG-EQA, combining causal event graphs with natural language statements in inputs. They test nine prompting configurations, involving combinations of zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies, paired with text, graph, or text+graph modalities.

Result: TAG-EQA outperformed text-only baselines by 5% on average on the TORQUESTRA benchmark, with improvements up to 12% in zero-shot and 18% in graph-augmented chain-of-thought scenarios.

Conclusion: Causal event graphs enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities in event question answering without fine-tuning. This work provides a flexible approach for integrating structured knowledge into prompt-based QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-cost and structure-free evaluation method using semantic embedding distances to assess responses of language models, achieving high accuracy and regression scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inefficiencies and limitations in current response classification methods for Language Models, which are either computationally expensive or unsuitable under real-world conditions.

Method: The paper introduces a structure-free evaluation approach utilizing semantic embedding distances to match LM-generated text with target candidates, allowing robust classifications with lower computational costs.

Result: The proposed method reports a regression score of approximately 0.97 and an accuracy of about 96% when compared against human annotations, validated over three datasets and three different LM architectures.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that this structure-free evaluation method is both effective and computationally efficient, providing a promising alternative for automatic LM response assessments.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

TL;DR: The authors propose Expert Question Decomposition (EQD) to improve domain-specific quantitative reasoning in large language models using a two-step fine-tuning process and a reward function for sub-questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of domain-specific quantitative reasoning in fields requiring expert knowledge and complex question answering.

Method: They introduce EQD, involving a two-step fine-tuning framework with a reward-based evaluation of sub-questions, requiring minimal resources for training and efficient inference.

Result: EQD outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models and improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5% across benchmark datasets in the financial domain.

Conclusion: EQD is an efficient and effective approach for enhancing domain-specific QA, highlighting the importance of single supporting questions over detailed guidance steps.

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit

### [99] [ReSSFormer: A Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer for Scalable and Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01585)
*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer addresses long-context reasoning, efficiency, and generalization issues in Transformers by introducing innovations like recurrent inference, sparse attention, and content-based structure modeling, leading to better performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Transformer architectures' limitations in handling long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and ability to generalize structural information, without relying on rigid stacking or positional encodings.

Method: ReSSFormer introduces three key components: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for iterative deep reasoning, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM) for efficient context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder Structure (SOES) for structure induction without positional encodings.

Result: ReSSFormer outperforms competitive models across tasks like language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive problems, maintaining comparable computation and parameter usage.

Conclusion: ReSSFormer demonstrates a scalable, efficient, and flexible Transformer architecture by replacing depth stacking, full attention, and positional encodings with innovations that improve reasoning, efficiency, and structural handling.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

### [100] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called CLUE that leverages the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) for determining the correctness of outputs, showing it outperforms other methods while being minimalist and non-parametric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more accurate methods to assess LLM outputs, as existing ones relying on text-level information or token probabilities often fall short and can be unreliable.

Method: The method, named CLUE, is a non-parametric verifier that summarizes reasoning traces through changes in hidden states and classifies correctness by comparing these to pre-identified 'success' and 'failure' clusters, all without trainable parameters.

Result: CLUE demonstrated superior performance over LLM-as-a-judge baselines and confidence-based methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements across tasks such as AIME 24/25 and GPQA.

Conclusion: The results confirm that hidden states contain strong signals for verification, and CLUE's minimalist design effectively harnesses this, presenting a promising approach to LLM output assessment.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

*Neal Gregory Lawton,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, concluding that performance improvements are similar across methods, but computational costs and dataset characteristics determine optimal choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the question of how fine-tuning strategies for RAG pipelines affect performance and computational costs, given the growing use of RAG frameworks for question answering tasks.

Method: The paper evaluates the performance of multiple fine-tuning approaches for RAG pipelines — independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase fine-tuning — through experiments measuring EM and F1 metrics, while analyzing computational cost trade-offs.

Result: All fine-tuning strategies show similar improvements in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, though they differ significantly in computational costs.

Conclusion: The selection of the fine-tuning strategy should depend on dataset characteristics (e.g., context labels availability) and computational constraints, rather than the performance improvement itself.

Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of biomedical literature has made accessing precise medical information challenging, and existing systems fail to deliver comprehensive explanations, limiting their utility in clinical decision-making.

Method: RAG-BioQA integrates retrieval-augmented generation techniques, using BioBERT embeddings, FAISS indexing, and various re-ranking methods for context selection, before synthesizing answers through a fine-tuned T5 model.

Result: The framework demonstrated substantial improvements over baseline methods on the PubMedQA dataset, achieving high scores across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics.

Conclusion: RAG-BioQA significantly enhances biomedical knowledge retrieval by providing accessible, evidence-based, long-form answers, thus addressing the limitations of current systems in supporting clinical decision-making.

Abstract: The exponential growth of biomedical literature creates significant
challenges for accessing precise medical information. Current biomedical
question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to
provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making.
We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented
generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based,
long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with
FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT,
MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a
fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show
significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state
of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.

### [103] [Efficient Training of Robust Traditional Chinese LLaMA-1B on a Single Consumer GPU: Continual Pre-training, SFT, and DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01616)
*Yu-Cheng Chih,Ming-Tao Duan,Yong-Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PureTC-1B, a stabilization pipeline for small language models to improve their reliability in Traditional Chinese outputs using LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying small language models for Traditional Chinese applications is challenging due to token-level instability and language switching issues.

Method: The paper utilizes a three-stage pipeline—Continual Pre-Training on TC corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization—to stabilize model outputs without fully retraining the model.

Result: PureTC-1B reduces non-TC token outputs by 51.3% and incorrect-language tokens by up to 77.2% compared to larger models.

Conclusion: PureTC-1B demonstrates effective stabilization of Traditional Chinese outputs using efficient techniques, providing a practical solution for language-centric AI deployments.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

### [104] [AMAS: Adaptively Determining Communication Topology for LLM-based Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01617)
*Hui Yi Leong,Yuheng Li,Yuqing Wu,Wenwen Ouyang,Wei Zhu,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMAS, a framework for improving large language model multi-agent systems (MAS) through dynamic graph configurations, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS architectures in industrial problem-solving are limited by rigid, handcrafted graph structures that fail to adapt to contextual needs, resulting in reduced effectiveness across various tasks.

Method: The paper presents AMAS, featuring a dynamic graph designer that leverages lightweight LLM adaptation to autonomously design task-specific graph configurations, replacing inflexible, universal templates.

Result: The authors validated AMAS across benchmarks like question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation, demonstrating it outperforms both single-agent and multi-agent state-of-the-art methods across diverse LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Context-sensitive, adaptable graph structures are essential for achieving high performance in LLM-based MAS frameworks, as demonstrated by AMAS.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

*John Hawkins,Aditya Pramar,Rodney Beard,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models are susceptible to manipulation via jailbreak prompts, tricking them into bypassing safety measures. The study evaluates machine learning models' efficacy in detecting such prompts, concluding BERT fine-tuning as the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in LLMs to ensure the safety and integrity of their responses, safeguarding them from harmful manipulation.

Method: Evaluate various machine learning models, particularly a fine-tuned BERT, for their ability to distinguish between genuine and jailbreak prompts using current datasets. Analyze unseen jailbreak strategies and visualize distinguishing keywords.

Result: Fine-tuned BERT achieves the best performance in identifying jailbreak prompts. Keywords analysis reveals explicit reflexivity in prompts as a potential signal for jailbreak intent.

Conclusion: End-to-end fine-tuning of BERT is effective for detecting jailbreak prompts. Structural characteristics within prompts could be leveraged to enhance detection capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

*Zhaoxin Feng,Jianfei Ma,Emmanuele Chersoni,Xiaojing Zhao,Xiaoyi Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates enhancing autoregressive language models, like Llama, by introducing bidirectional attention for better text embeddings and semantic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations in semantic representation and embedding tasks caused by the unidirectional attention mechanism in current LLMs.

Method: The authors adapt and train Llama models to incorporate bidirectional attention while applying both unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning techniques.

Result: The paper shows improved capabilities in semantic representation tasks by allowing bidirectional attention in Llama variants.

Conclusion: Incorporating bidirectional attention can mitigate the constraints of unidirectional mechanisms, enhancing the embedding and semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

### [107] [SoK: Measuring What Matters for Closed-Loop Security Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01654)
*Mudita Khurana,Raunak Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLASP, a framework for evaluating autonomous agents in cybersecurity, addressing the gaps in closed-loop security capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cybersecurity defenses struggle against evolving, AI-driven offenses, due to fragmented research and tooling, necessitating integrated solutions to fill capability gaps.

Method: The authors present CLASP, a framework that aligns the cybersecurity lifecycle with core agentic capabilities, and introduce the CLC Score to evaluate operational effectiveness and loop closure.

Result: CLASP is applied to 21 security systems, highlighting strengths and identifying capability gaps. A CLC Score and benchmark outline are proposed for evaluating closed-loop agents.

Conclusion: CLASP and the CLC Score provide a standardized framework and metrics to advance the development and evaluation of autonomous security systems.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

*Yinhong Liu,Jianfeng He,Hang Su,Ruixue Lian,Yi Nian,Jake Vincent,Srikanth Vishnubhotla,Robinson Piramuthu,Saab Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDSEval, a benchmark for automatic evaluation of multimodal dialogue summarization (MDS) models, addressing their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack robust evaluation mechanisms grounded in human annotations for MDS models, necessitating a meta-evaluation benchmark to ensure reliability and better cost efficiency.

Method: Developed MDSEval benchmark with human judgments across eight quality aspects and implemented a filtering framework using Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities.

Result: Validated the limitations of current modal evaluation methods, showing their biases and inability to differentiate summaries generated by advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: MDSEval establishes key evaluation dimensions for MDS and highlights necessary improvements in modal evaluation methods to enhance reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

### [109] [FOR-Prompting: From Objection to Revision via an Asymmetric Prompting Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01674)
*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting introduces a reasoning protocol that enhances accuracy and coherence in tasks by using objection-guided revisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning protocols such as CoT and ToT lack explicit mechanisms for external questioning and self-revision.

Method: FOR-Prompting uses a structured protocol where roles (Defender, Objectioner, and Host) interact to propose answers, raise objections, and resolve inconsistencies without retraining.

Result: FOR-Prompting achieves a 22% gain over single-prompt methods and matches CoT accuracy, improves reasoning ratings, corrects mistakes without supervision, and enhances performance for smaller models.

Conclusion: This protocol optimizes reasoning and exploration while being model-agnostic and scalable, showing promise for tasks across diverse model sizes.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

### [110] [How Do Language Models Compose Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01685)
*Apoorv Khandelwal,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the mechanisms large language models (LLMs) use to solve two-hop factual recall tasks and identifies compositional and direct processing methods. The investigation highlights a "compositionality gap" and links processing mechanism choice to embedding space geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand whether LLMs truly utilize compositional mechanisms to solve tasks, addressing concerns about the "compositionality gap." This helps clarify the underlying processes driving LLM problem-solving.

Method: Using the logit lens analysis on residual stream activations in LLMs, the authors differentiate between compositional and direct task-solving mechanisms. They study the relationship between embedding space geometry and processing methods.

Result: The research reveals the presence of two distinct solving mechanisms in LLMs: compositional processing (utilizing intermediate variables) and direct processing (bypassing intermediate steps). Embedding space geometry influences the choice of mechanism.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit a compositionality gap and use varying processing methods depending on the alignment of their embedding spaces. Improved understanding of these mechanisms could inform the design of more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

*Seungseop Lim,Gibaeg Kim,Wooseok Han,Jean Seo,Hyunkyung Lee,Jaehyo Yoo,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a problem in medical dialogue generation where models exhibit repetitive questioning due to skewed training data, called Format Inertia, and proposes a data rebalancing technique to alleviate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve medical pre-consultation dialogue systems powered by LLMs by addressing the failure mechanism induced by skewed training datasets.

Method: The authors propose rebalancing the turn-count distribution in the training dataset to correct biases that lead to poor performance in multi-turn medical dialogues.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that rebalancing the training data alleviates the problem of repetitive, uninformative question generation seen as Format Inertia.

Conclusion: Data-centric rebalancing in training can effectively mitigate Format Inertia, enhancing the diagnostic utility of medical pre-consultation dialogues generated by LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathLens is a benchmark to dissect the perception, reasoning, and integration skills of multimodal reasoning models, focusing on geometry problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand where and how multimodal reasoning models improve, beyond merely using aggregate accuracy as an evaluation metric.

Method: Developed MathLens, a benchmark that evaluates multimodal reasoning models based on perception, reasoning, and integration, and introduced supporting annotations to ensure consistency.

Result: Reinforcement learning improves perception, reasoning improves alongside perception, and integration suffers from residual challenges. Robustness varies depending on training strategies.

Conclusion: Different training methods affect subskills unequally, with integration being the weakest link in current multimodal reasoning models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores transforming engineering design standards into modular and interoperable ontologies that enable automated quality assurance in plant design and equipment selection processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of transitioning product specifications and design standards from document-centric approaches to digitalized systems to enhance automation and interoperability.

Method: They create modular ontologies using modeling patterns for engineering design standards based on international piping and valve norms. These ontologies are stored in W3C-compliant formats and aligned with ISO DIS 23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology.

Result: Testing these ontologies on a valve selection process showcased automated validation for standards compliance and semantic reasoning-based verification for specifications matching manufacturer product types.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of creating reusable, modular ontologies for design standards, paving the way for digitized Smart Standards enabling semantic validation in industrial processes.

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

### [114] [Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782)
*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Refusal Index (RI) to measure how accurately large language models refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inaccurate refusal behaviors in large language models compromise factual reliability, and existing metrics fail to faithfully measure this ability.

Method: The authors propose RI, which uses Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability, measured through a lightweight two-pass evaluation method.

Result: RI differentiates the refusal abilities of various models across datasets, remains stable under different conditions, and brings attention to potential flaws in current LLM refusal behaviors.

Conclusion: RI is a critical complement to traditional accuracy metrics, addressing an overlooked aspect of factuality in evaluating large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses 16 unsupervised evaluation metrics for extracting semantic blocks from Russian judicial decisions, validated against expert reviews, and highlights scalable yet imperfect annotation-free screening tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for scalable methods to evaluate text extraction from judicial decisions, driven by rapid advancements in AI applied to legal natural language processing.

Method: Researchers evaluated 16 unsupervised metrics across diverse categories (e.g., document-based, semantic, legal-specific) using 1,000 judicial decisions and 7,168 expert reviews, employing statistical measures like correlations, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error.

Result: Term Frequency Coherence and Coverage Ratio showed the best correlations with expert ratings, while metrics like Legal Term Density exhibited strong negative correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score demonstrated moderate alignment, indicating limited performance using GPT-based models for legal texts.

Conclusion: Unsupervised metrics offer scalable evaluation tools for legal NLP but cannot fully replace expert judgment in critical legal analyses. These tools contribute to annotation-free judicial analytics and AI ethics in legal contexts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

*Xin Liu,Rongwu Xu,Xinyi Jia,Jason Liao,Jiao Sun,Ling Huang,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FraudSquad, a hybrid model to detect persuasive spam reviews generated by large language models (LLMs). FraudSquad shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and uses minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence of LLM-generated spam reviews threatens the trustworthiness of online platforms and challenges traditional detection systems.

Method: FraudSquad leverages text embeddings from a pre-trained language model combined with a gated graph transformer to identify spam nodes, utilizing semantic and behavioral data efficiently.

Result: FraudSquad achieves up to 44.22% higher precision and 43.01% better recall compared to existing methods on LLM-generated spam datasets, while also performing well on human-written spam datasets.

Conclusion: FraudSquad shows promise as an effective and resource-efficient solution for countering LLM-generated spam, and its introduction emphasizes the immediate need for adapting to the LLM era in spam detection.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

### [117] [Syntactic Blind Spots: How Misalignment Leads to LLMs Mathematical Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01831)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates a systematic failure mode in large language models (LLMs) called 'syntactic blind spots,' where models err on semantically simple math problems presented in unusual ways. By rephrasing questions and measuring syntactic complexity with Dependency Locality Theory, they identify structural misalignment as the cause of failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why large language models occasionally fail on semantically straightforward math problems phrased atypically, despite having sufficient mathematical competence.

Method: The authors rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates from correctly answered ones and quantify syntactic complexity using Dependency Locality Theory to analyze error patterns.

Result: Rephrased questions that preserved meaning but simplified syntax resulted in better performance. Models showed higher error rates for problems with increased syntactic complexity on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Reasoning errors in LLMs are often due to structural misalignment rather than lack of conceptual knowledge, emphasizing the need for syntax-aware interventions to mitigate inductive failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

*Shicheng Liu,Kai Sun,Lisheng Fu,Xilun Chen,Xinyuan Zhang,Zhaojiang Lin,Rulin Shao,Yue Liu,Anuj Kumar,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCRIBES, a framework for extracting structured data from semi-structured web content using reinforcement learning, making it efficient and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factual data in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes is abundant online but difficult to extract due to complex formatting.

Method: SCRIBES employs reinforcement learning to generate reusable extraction scripts for structurally similar webpages, leveraging layout similarities as a reward signal. It improves via iterative training on synthetic annotations from CommonCrawl data.

Result: SCRIBES outperformed strong baselines in script quality by 13% and improved GPT-4o's downstream question-answering accuracy by over 4%.

Conclusion: SCRIBES facilitates scalable, efficient, and reliable extraction of structured web data from semi-structured formats, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on developing multimodal and language-only models using low-resource, developmentally plausible datasets for the BabyLM challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the discrepancy between vision-and-language models and human language acquisition, particularly in low-resource environments.

Method: Experiments using model merging by weighted linear interpolation to improve language-only performance in multimodal models.

Result: Confirmed that multimodal models underperform on language-only grammatical benchmarks and merging with language-only models helps improve these aspects while retaining multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: Model merging is a promising strategy to maintain language-only abilities in multimodal models on low-resource datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPAIR is a lifelong editing framework designed to make updates to large language models precise, cost-effective, and stable by minimizing knowledge loss and unintended side-effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in post-training of large language models, specifically the high cost and risks of introducing new knowledge or correcting errors, along with the instability caused by retraining.

Method: REPAIR employs a closed-loop feedback mechanism, dynamic memory management, frequent knowledge fusion, and locality guards to ensure stable and precise edits while preserving non-target knowledge.

Result: Experiments show that REPAIR improved editing accuracy by 10%-30% across different model families and significantly mitigated knowledge forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed REPAIR framework is robust and scalable, providing a method for reliable updates to LLMs and supporting their continual evolution.

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper surveys and analyzes reward models (RMs) for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning performance through systematic and efficient use of reward models (RMs).

Method: The paper reviews fundamental aspects like RM architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation. It explores RM applications such as inference guidance, data synthesis, iterative self-improvement, and reinforcement learning-based finetuning.

Result: Key insights about RM effectiveness, applications, and open challenges within LLM reasoning are discussed, alongside empirical findings.

Conclusion: Reward models are pivotal for guiding and improving LLM reasoning, and their development requires attention to selection, generalization, and evaluation challenges.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

*Davide Gabrielli,Simone Sestito,Iacopo Masi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a framework aiming to enhance robustness of LLMs and enable detection of unsafe inputs by inverting model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses for LLMs against adversarial inputs are fragmented and lack a unified approach, prompting the need for an advanced framework.

Method: ILM improves robustness against input perturbations and allows reverse-checking outputs to identify harmful input triggers, transforming LLMs into more analyzable systems.

Result: The implementation of ILM enhances adversarial robustness, enables native grounding, and provides foundations for improved control and trustworthiness in LLMs.

Conclusion: ILM represents a step towards next-generation LLMs that combine robustness, grounding, and controllability, with practical utility for RED teaming scenarios.

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Veri-R1 leverages reinforcement learning to enhance LLM claim verification accuracy by interacting with a search engine for dynamic evidence retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning in claim verification, which primarily relied on static prompt engineering or predetermined reasoning workflows.

Method: Proposed Veri-R1, an online RL framework that uses reward signals to train LLMs for improved planning, retrieval, and reasoning. It dynamically integrates LLM interactions with search engines for real-world simulation.

Result: Veri-R1 achieved up to 30% improvement in joint accuracy and doubled the evidence score, often outperforming larger-scale models.

Conclusion: Online RL is effective for accurate claim verification, bridging the gap between LLM capabilities and real-world applications. Open-source code supports further advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using language models to predict individual value interpretations by leveraging subjective annotations related to Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topics (SEAT). Results show incorporating all dimensions improves predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognize diverse human perspectives and avoid AI biases by exploring if individual value interpretations can be predicted using annotation behaviors.

Method: Language models are tested on zero- and few-shot settings to predict individual values using examples of annotator behavior on SEAT dimensions.

Result: Providing SEAT dimensions simultaneously improves predictive performance compared to isolated dimensions or no individual information. Variations among annotators highlight the need for subjective considerations.

Conclusion: This preliminary study introduces a novel approach to using annotation behavior for individual value prediction in AI, setting a stage for further research on larger scales.

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Schema normalization significantly impacts NL2SQL model performance. Denormalized schemas excel in simple retrieval queries, while normalized schemas shine for aggregation queries due to reduced errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how schema design influences NL2SQL performance, as prior works only evaluate on fixed schemas.

Method: Evaluate eight large language models on synthetic datasets with different normalization levels and real-world datasets.

Result: Highly normalized schemas (2NF/3NF) perform better on aggregation queries but face challenges for simple retrieval queries. Denormalized schemas work better in zero-shot settings for simpler queries.

Conclusion: Schema normalization level affects NL2SQL query accuracy; adaptive schema design is key to improving real-world NL2SQL interfaces.

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BanglaMultiHate, the largest annotated dataset for Bangla hate speech detection in a multi-task setting, comparing various models including LLMs under fine-tuning conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of reliable moderation tools for hate speech detection in low-resource languages like Bangla, particularly multi-task systems addressing different facets such as type, severity, and targets.

Method: The authors created BanglaMultiHate, a large annotated dataset, and tested classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs using zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA-tuned LLMs show competitive performance but Bangla-specific pretraining models like BanglaBERT still provide more robust outcomes for detecting hate speech.

Conclusion: The culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining is essential for developing effective hate speech moderation tools, especially in low-resource settings, and the released dataset offers a valuable benchmark.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how large language models (LLMs) exhibit creativity as computational authors, emphasizing processes rather than outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the gap in understanding LLMs' creativity based on their decision-making processes rather than solely their end results.

Method: The authors used controlled prompting techniques to assess LLMs' creative preferences by assigning different authorial personas.

Result: LLMs were found to prioritize Style significantly over other narrative elements like Character, Event, and Setting. Each model exhibited distinct creative profiles.

Conclusion: The approach offers a systematic method to investigate authorial creativity in AI, enhancing the understanding of their creative decision-making processes.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a framework for speech-in speech-out dialogue systems that predicts tool queries during user speech. It improves accuracy and reduces latency in tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines for dialogue systems suffer from latency issues and can generate unnatural responses. Speech-in speech-out systems are faster and more natural but lack factual grounding and can hallucinate. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors developed Streaming RAG, a framework that teaches the model to predict tool queries in parallel with speech and generate spoken summaries combining tool data with real-time audio.

Result: The framework improves QA accuracy from 11.1% to 34.2% and reduces tool-use latency by 20%. It was evaluated using AudioCRAG, a speech-based benchmark derived from the CRAG dataset.

Conclusion: Streaming RAG enhances accuracy and responsiveness, providing a modality-agnostic solution for real-time, agentic AI assistants. It extends tool use integration to speech-in speech-out systems.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

*Siddhant Arora,Jinchuan Tian,Hayato Futami,Jiatong Shi,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Emiru Tsunoo,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCoT, a streaming chain-of-thought framework for duplex spoken dialogue systems, which alternates processing user inputs and generating responses block by block. It improves on coherence, latency, and overlapping interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current E2E spoken dialogue systems, such as their reliance on VAD, inability to handle pauses vs. turn completions, and the lag in semantic reasoning of duplex systems compared to cascaded models.

Method: The authors propose SCoT, which processes user inputs and generates system responses in a blockwise manner, leveraging frame-level alignments and intermediate target generation for coherence.

Result: Experiments indicate that SCoT yields more coherent and interpretable responses than existing methods, with reduced latency and better handling of overlapping interactions compared to conventional turn-by-turn systems.

Conclusion: SCoT provides a significant improvement in dialogue systems by achieving lower latency, overlapping user interactions, and coherence without the need for complex architectures or explicit VAD.

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

### [130] [The Disparate Impacts of Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02128)
*Jameson Sandler,Ahmet Üstün,Marco Romanelli,Sara Hooker,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates speculative decoding—a method to speed up large language models (LLMs)—and identifies unequal speed-up rates across tasks, especially for underrepresented ones. It proposes and validates a mitigation strategy to enhance fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the disparity in speed-up rates achieved by speculative decoding across different tasks, which can lead to unfairness in performance, particularly for underrepresented and underperformed tasks.

Method: The authors conduct an analysis of the disparities caused by speculative decoding and derive a fairness metric. They then propose a mitigation strategy to improve fairness and test it using multiple drafter-large model combinations.

Result: The mitigation strategy proposed in this paper achieves an average improvement of 12% in the fairness metric across evaluated model pairs.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding introduces unfair task-dependent speed-up rates in LLMs. However, this paper offers an effective solution to reduce this unfairness, leading to more balanced performance.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

*Zhaoning Yu,Will Su,Leitian Tao,Haozhu Wang,Aashu Singh,Hanchao Yu,Jianyu Wang,Hongyang Gao,Weizhe Yuan,Jason Weston,Ping Yu,Jing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RESTRAIN introduces a way for models to self-improve in reasoning tasks without gold-labeled data by penalizing overconfidence and low consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data is effective but costly and struggles with harder reasoning tasks.

Method: The framework uses self-penalization to leverage the model's answer distribution, penalizing overconfidence and low-consistency examples while optimizing reasoning chains.

Result: On benchmarks like AIME25, MMLU_STEM, and GPQA-Diamond, RESTRAIN significantly improves reasoning performance, sometimes rivalling models trained with gold-labels.

Conclusion: RESTRAIN shows that scalable reasoning improvement is possible without relying on curated labeled data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

*Hsuan Su,Ting-Yao Hu,Hema Swetha Koppula,Kundan Krishna,Hadi Pouransari,Cheng-Yu Hsieh,Cem Koc,Joseph Yitan Cheng,Oncel Tuzel,Raviteja Vemulapalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the detection of hallucinated spans in large language models, introduces a reinforcement learning framework (RL4HS), and demonstrates its effectiveness compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of detecting hallucinated spans in large language models, as hallucinations undermine the reliability of generated content.

Method: The RL4HS framework uses reinforcement learning with span-level reward functions and introduces mechanisms like Class-Aware Policy Optimization to balance rewards.

Result: RL4HS significantly outperforms pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning methods on the RAGTruth benchmark.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with span-level rewards is essential for accurately detecting hallucination spans in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

*Felix Brei,Lorenz Bühmann,Johannes Frey,Daniel Gerber,Lars-Peter Meyer,Claus Stadler,Kirill Bulert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method utilizing large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language questions to SPARQL queries through iterative exploration instead of a single-shot approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the high barrier of entry for non-experts to interact with knowledge graphs using SPARQL, and the need for improvements in the Text2SPARQL domain.

Method: The authors introduce SPINACH, an LLM-based agent that translates natural language to SPARQL queries iteratively, detailing its architecture and design choices.

Result: The paper provides an analysis of SPINACH's behavior, highlighting areas for future improvements in its iterative translation approach.

Conclusion: Utilizing iterative exploration with LLMs shows promise in simplifying SPARQL query interaction, with room for targeted enhancements in functionality.

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

### [134] [Say One Thing, Do Another? Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204)
*Lingzhong Dong,Ziqi Zhou,Shuaibo Yang,Haiyue Sheng,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Zheng Wu,Gongshen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation framework to identify reasoning-execution gaps in vision-language model-powered mobile agents, focusing on the alignment between reasoning and actions. This framework highlights prevalent issues in current systems and aids in improving trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked reasoning-execution gaps in mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models, which may lead to over-trust and potentially harmful actions.

Method: The proposed framework, called Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), evaluates whether the reasoning process aligns with the correct (ground-truth) actions. It combines GTA with the Exact Match metric to jointly assess reasoning and execution accuracy.

Result: Experimental analysis reveals prevalent reasoning-execution gaps, with execution gaps being more frequent than reasoning gaps. Larger models show reduced, but still significant, execution gaps.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying gaps in reasoning and execution, helping to create more trustworthy and dependable mobile-use agents.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

*Xiaoyang Yuan,Yujuan Ding,Yi Bin,Wenqi Shao,Jinyu Cai,Jingkuan Song,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO) enhances reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by using multiple teacher models for guidance only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in reasoning diversity and performance caused by intrinsic biases and restricted exploration in existing RL methods for LLMs.

Method: AMPO introduces a 'guidance-on-demand' mechanism paired with a comprehension-based selection system for adaptive learning from multiple teachers.

Result: AMPO significantly outperforms the baseline GRPO, showing improvements of 4.3% on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, with boosted exploration diversity and efficiency.

Conclusion: AMPO offers a scalable and efficient approach to enhancing reasoning diversity and generalizability in LLMs, rivaling methods that require more powerful single-teacher models and more data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increase the effectiveness of Arabic-language cyberbullying detection methodologies.

Method: Developed a dataset of Arabic posts, utilized the kappa tool for annotations, and conducted experiments with various deep learning models, including LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and BERT with diverse embeddings.

Result: Bi-LSTM with FastText embedding achieved 98% accuracy, outperforming other tested models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances Arabic-language cyberbullying detection, achieving high accuracy with advanced embeddings and models like Bi-LSTM with FastText.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of overthinking in Large Language Models (LLMs) during reasoning tasks by introducing a metric and a novel reasoning paradigm that optimizes the depth of reasoning based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the inefficiency and adaptability issues caused by overthinking in LLMs during reasoning tasks, where unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simple problems are generated.

Method: They introduce the Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA) metric to measure exploration during reasoning and propose a Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism within the 'Explore Briefly, Then Decide' reasoning paradigm to dynamically determine when to conclude reasoning.

Result: Experimental results across mathematical benchmarks show reduced response length by up to 71% on simpler problems while maintaining problem-solving accuracy, demonstrating mitigated overthinking.

Conclusion: The proposed approach creates a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process for LLMs by balancing exploration and decision-making through TECA and CER, addressing overthinking effectively without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoMosaic-Bench to evaluate tool-augmented agents in multi-source information seeking across various domains, revealing significant challenges in using domain-specific tools and general-purpose search effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents are overly reliant on web searches, which are noisy and lack domain-specific precision. There is a need to evaluate agents' ability to integrate domain tools with web search for complex, real-world tasks.

Method: The authors developed the InfoMosaic-Bench benchmark with tasks across six domains and a scalable pipeline (InfoMosaic-Flow) to ensure task reliability and non-triviality. Experiments were conducted with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents.

Result: The study found that web search alone was insufficient, domain tools provided inconsistent benefits across domains, and current LLMs faced challenges with tool usage and selection, contributing to significant failure rates.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented LLM agents currently struggle to effectively integrate domain-specific tools with general-purpose search for complex tasks, requiring further advancements in tool handling capabilities.

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

*Wen Yang,Junhong Wu,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the ability of English-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to generalize reasoning capabilities to other languages and introduces benchmarks and metrics for evaluating cross-lingual transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to understand whether reasoning capabilities learned in English through Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) can generalize effectively to other languages, addressing the limitations in multilingual capabilities of LRMs.

Method: The paper evaluates English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks, introduces new metrics for transferability, and conducts parallel training studies to assess performance over multiple languages.

Result: Results indicate that cross-lingual transferability is influenced by initial model strength, target language, and training paradigm. Models tend to rely on English-specific patterns, limiting generalization. A substantial performance jump is observed when adding parallel languages, revealing a predictable scaling law for generalization.

Conclusion: English-centric LRMs struggle to fully generalize reasoning across languages, with discrepancies highlighted by a Monolingual Generalization Gap. The study offers valuable insights for improving language independence in LRMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Motivation: The paper aims to develop cost-effective, high-performing embedding models by removing the reliance on massive pretraining, expensive synthetic datasets, and complex pipelines.

Method: The authors finetune foundation models using 6 million query-document-negative tuples sourced from open, non-synthetic datasets.

### [143] [Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306)
*Raphael Tang,Crystina Zhang,Wenyan Li,Carmen Lai,Pontus Stenetorp,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of the Elo rating system in evaluating large language models (LLMs) and suggests that draws in arena evaluations are linked to query difficulty rather than model equality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the validity of using the Elo rating system for modeling rating dynamics in LLM evaluations, particularly in interpreting the meaning of draws and their impact on rating adjustments.

Method: The authors analyze three real-world arena-style LLM evaluation datasets, compare changes in predictive accuracy when ignoring rating updates for draws, and assess the characteristics of queries associated with draws.

Result: Ignoring rating updates for draws leads to a 1-3% relative improvement in battle outcome prediction accuracy across four rating systems. Moreover, draws are more frequent for queries that are rated as very easy or highly objective.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that current draw semantics in rating systems need to be reevaluated. Draws may better reflect query properties, like difficulty, rather than equality of models. Future rating systems should incorporate query attributes to improve performance.

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LVTINO, a zero-shot method leveraging Video Consistency Models for high-definition video restoration, overcoming issues like temporal inconsistency in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of temporally inconsistent reconstructions in video restoration using image-based latent diffusion models.

Method: The method involves using Video Consistency Models (VCMs) to distill video latent diffusion models for fast generators, enabling smooth and consistent frame transitions.

Result: LVTINO achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, ensuring measurement consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and requiring minimal neural function evaluations.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new benchmark in reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency for video restoration using video-based priors, significantly outperforming frame-by-frame image LDM approaches.

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [145] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in text-to-image generation models by proposing a method to extract and integrate styles from reference images into generative processes for precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in text-to-image generation where fine-grained styles are hard to describe in text and reference image styles are misaligned with text-based guidance.

Method: The paper introduces a three-stage training approach using a style encoder and style projection layer to align stylistic representations with textual conditions, along with the construction of the Style30k-captions dataset.

Result: The method enables fine-grained stylistic control in image generation without altering the structural framework of pretrained generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach allows for enhanced control of stylized image generation, bridging the gap between textual and visual stylistic alignment.

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for detecting struggles during skill acquisition. It compiles annotations across 61.68 hours of videos, covering learning evolution over multiple tasks and repetitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how struggles evolve during skill acquisition to optimize learning and develop assistive systems.

Method: Collect a recorded dataset of 18 tasks across 4 activities with repeated attempts by participants, then define the task of struggle detection as a temporal action localization problem.

Result: Temporal Action Localization models achieved an average mAP of 34.56% across tasks and 19.24% across activities in identifying struggle segments.

Conclusion: Struggle is a transferable and detectable concept across tasks, though improving detection remains a challenge.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS introduces a lightweight U-Net-based architecture as a neural operator for solving various PDEs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art PDE solvers rely on transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and parameter-heavy. The need is for a more efficient and compact model.

Method: The paper proposes a residual U-Net-based architecture for solving PDEs and utilizes an auto-regressive pretraining strategy that mimics the behavior of numerical solvers to learn physical processes.

Result: SPUS generalizes effectively on 6 unseen downstream PDEs from diverse physical systems, using fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: SPUS demonstrates the viability of residual U-Net architecture as a foundation model for PDEs, offering both efficient parameter usage and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo is a reinforcement learning framework solving multi-human generation issues like identity duplication. It outperforms existing methods on accuracy while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address existing challenges in text-to-image models which perform poorly on multi-human prompts, such as face duplication and incorrect person counts.

Method: DisCo uses reinforcement learning with Group-Relative Policy Optimization and a reward system that enhances identity diversity, count accuracy, and image fidelity. It employs a single-stage learning curriculum without extra annotations.

Result: In tests, DisCo achieved 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and outclassed other models in maintaining individual identity diversity and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: DisCo sets a new standard for multi-human generative models, offering scalability, annotation-free training, and resolving identity duplication issues effectively.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for worldwide visual geo-localization by combining geographic and visual data representations. It achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geo-localization using visual inputs has challenges due to varying geographic and atmospheric factors across regions. The paper aims to overcome these issues with innovative approaches.

Method: The authors propose hierarchical geographic embeddings and enhanced visual representations by fusing image appearance features and semantic segmentation maps.

Result: Their approach yielded record-breaking performances across 22 out of 25 metrics on five benchmark datasets, outperforming previous methods and large vision-language models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the fusion of geographic and visual representations plays a vital role in improving geo-localization accuracy.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS is a novel technique for efficient instruction tuning of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), achieving significant data reduction while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data-efficient learning in LVLMs perform poorly compared to random selection, highlighting the need for a principled approach.

Method: XMAS clusters examples based on cross-modal attention matrix similarities using trajectories of top singular values from a proxy LVLM, enabling effective subset sampling.

Result: XMAS reduces training data for LLaVA-665k by 50% and Vision-Flan by 85% while maintaining performance on benchmarks and speeding up training by 1.2x.

Conclusion: XMAS improves data efficiency in training LVLMs, outperforming prior methods in data reduction and preserving model accuracy on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for image generation that integrates both continuous and discrete methods effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for a method that combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches in image generation.

Method: Using Variational Flow Matching, the proposed method learns categorical posteriors over codebook indices and computes velocity fields in a continuous embedding space.

Result: Purrception achieves faster convergence in training compared to baseline methods and delivers competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k 256x256 image generation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can bridge continuous and discrete methods, enhancing training efficiency in vector-quantized image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [152] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework for generating synthetic contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images and segmenting aortic structures from non-contrast CT scans in one step, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the risks associated with contrast agents used in standard abdominal aortic aneurysm assessments and mitigate error accumulation in existing multi-stage deep learning pipelines.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework integrating conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning for simultaneous image synthesis and segmentation, employing a semi-supervised strategy for real-world clinical applications.

Result: Their method showed superior performance, achieving higher PSNR scores (25.61 dB), improved Dice scores for aortic lumen (0.89) and thrombus (0.53), and reducing MAE in clinical measurements of lumen diameter and thrombus area error.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the potential of end-to-end optimization for improving both image synthesis and anatomical segmentation in clinical applications, while addressing real-world challenges such as missing labels in datasets.

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for multi-modal content analysis, focusing on videos. It uses pre-trained models to convert video data into a semi-structured format and query-able knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing multi-modal content, especially videos, by creating efficient and flexible tools for prototyping pipelines.

Method: The framework uses pre-trained models to process video data. These models generate a temporal semi-structured format, which is further transformed into a knowledge graph representation.

Result: The approach enables the creation of frame-level indexed knowledge graphs that are query-able and support continual learning.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies multi-modal content analysis by facilitating dynamic incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and interactive querying.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

TL;DR: WALT introduces a framework to simplify web automation by utilizing pre-existing website functionalities as tools, reducing reliance on heavy LLM reasoning and step-by-step UI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web automation methods are fragile and fail under dynamic layouts and long tasks. Humans, however, effectively use websites through built-in functionalities like search and filter, inspiring the need for a tool-oriented automation approach.

Method: WALT reverse-engineers latent website functionalities into abstract tools (search, filter, etc.) that agents can invoke directly instead of relying on detailed UI interactions or hypothesizing skills.

Result: WALT outperforms existing methods on VisualWebArena and WebArena by achieving higher task success rates, using fewer steps and minimizing dependence on large language models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable paradigm for browser automation, leveraging latent functionalities inherently available on websites rather than relying on fragile, step-by-step approaches.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a semi-supervised segmentation framework for histopathology images, emphasizing topological consistency across predictions to enhance segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture meaningful semantic structures and tackle the challenge of densely distributed objects in histopathology image analysis.

Method: The framework uses stochastic dropouts and temporal snapshots to enforce topological consistency across predictions and introduces a novel matching strategy integrating spatial overlap with structural alignment.

Result: The proposed approach successfully reduces topological errors, leading to improved segmentations for better downstream analysis.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies and preserves relevant structures, achieving robust semi-supervised segmentation in histopathology, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

*Jiamu Bai,Xin Yu,Meilong Xu,Weitao Lu,Xin Pan,Kiwan Maeng,Daniel Kifer,Jian Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-LPO, a framework enhancing diffusion models for text-to-image tasks using listwise human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods for T2I models mainly optimize pairwise human preferences but don't address listwise preferences, which carry more nuanced feedback.

Method: The authors propose Diffusion-LPO based on listwise human preference rankings, leveraging the Plackett-Luce model to extend DPO objectives.

Result: Diffusion-LPO showed improved performance over pairwise DPO baselines in visual quality, text-to-image generation, image editing, and preference alignment tasks.

Conclusion: Using rank-based human feedback in Diffusion-LPO improves alignment and efficiency, making it suitable for multiple diffusion-based and personalized applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

<details>

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a unified method for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that supports both understanding and generation of images, overcoming challenges such as balancing semantic alignment with pixel-level fidelity in existing approaches.

Method: The paper proposes 'Bridge', a pure autoregressive MLLM that utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and introduces a new semantic-to-pixel discrete representation. This representation combines semantic tokens and fine-grained pixel tokens, minimally increasing sequence length while enhancing image generation fidelity.

Result: Bridge achieves competitive or superior results across diverse multimodal benchmarks for both understanding and generation, demonstrating high language alignment and precise visual detail description. It also requires less training data and reduced training time compared to previous unified MLLM approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Bridge approach successfully unifies image understanding and generation in a single framework, achieving high performance with improved training efficiency. This method makes strides in multimodal learning by resolving previous challenges in hybrid and pure autoregressive MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

### [158] [Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01547)
*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid model combining CNN and Bayesian deep learning to enhance reliability in oral cancer classification, especially in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of early oral cancer diagnosis, particularly in regions with limited datasets and high mortality due to inadequate healthcare systems.

Method: The hybrid model integrates CNN with Bayesian inference to ensure uncertainty quantification and was evaluated using smartphone photographic images across diverse datasets.

Result: The model achieved 94% accuracy on data similar to training and 88% on real-world datasets, showcasing superior generalizability compared to traditional CNNs, which scored 72.94%.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates the strength of Bayesian inference in enhancing the reliability and generalizability of oral cancer classification, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

### [159] [Cross-Breed Pig Identification Using Auricular Vein Pattern Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach for Small-Scale Farming Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02197)
*Emmanuel Nsengiyumvaa,Leonard Niyitegekaa,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a noninvasive biometric method for identifying mixed-breed pigs using the unique patterns of their auricular veins, achieving 98.12% precision with machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide small-scale farmers with a reliable, cost-effective alternative to traditional livestock identification methods, which are impractical for mixed-breed pigs and less accessible technologies.

Method: The method involved collecting ear vein images from 20 pigs, using smartphones and backlighting, and processing them via a computer vision pipeline. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), classified the extracted biometric features.

Result: The SVM model achieved a 98.12% precision rate for identifying pigs. The process took an average of 8.3 seconds from image acquisition to classification.

Conclusion: The study underscores the viability of auricular vein patterns for livestock identification, offering a stress-free and affordable solution for small-scale farmers and advancing precision farming for under-resourced communities.

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

### [160] [Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559)
*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Kangyang Luo,Qin Li,and Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CADTrans, a method for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), leveraging assistant domain modules and consistent strategies to improve domain-alignment and performance, particularly in hard sample cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source domain data is inaccessible in SFDA settings, making it challenging to construct stable invariant feature representations; current methods face difficulties due to hard samples and domain bias.

Method: The CADTrans framework uses an assistant domain module to generate diversified representations from aggregated global attentions. It applies consistent strategies to derive invariant feature representations and employs a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to align hard samples with easy samples in the same category.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126 show that CADTrans achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CADTrans effectively addresses key challenges in SFDA by generating domain-consistent feature representations and alleviating issues related to hard samples and domain bias, proving its efficacy in multiple benchmark tests.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

### [161] [Guiding Multimodal Large Language Models with Blind and Low Vision People Visual Questions for Proactive Visual Interpretations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01576)
*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study aims to improve visual interpretation applications for BLV users by leveraging historical user questions to produce contextually relevant image descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of current systems that offer generic and lengthy descriptions, which can hinder BLV users in quickly obtaining specific, relevant information.

Method: The authors developed a system that identifies past similar visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset, using associated questions to guide MLLM-generated image descriptions.

Result: An evaluation revealed that context-aware descriptions anticipated users' questions in 76.1% of cases and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons.

Conclusion: Context-aware systems are more effective at addressing BLV users' needs and preferences, enabling more efficient and useful exchanges.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader
understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation
benchmarks will be publicly available to aid research in reasoning/thinking
multimodal VLMs.

### [163] [NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608)
*Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method called Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN) to improve the reconstruction of signals from noisy or undersampled measurements by leveraging null-space properties of sensing matrices using neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging inverse problems face challenges due to their ill-posed nature, with infinite solutions existing in the null-space of the sensing operator. Previous methods fail to address the task-specific structure of that null-space, leading to suboptimal signal reconstruction.

Method: Instead of traditional image-domain constraints, the authors use NPN, a strategy that applies neural network-based non-linear projections to the null-space of the sensing operator for task-specific priors.

Result: Empirical studies across several inverse imaging tasks (e.g., compressive sensing, MRI, CT) demonstrate that NPN improves reconstruction fidelity when paired with various reconstruction techniques such as plug-and-play methods, deep image priors, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: NPN provides interpretability and flexibility by leveraging null-space structures specific to sensing matrices, showing theoretical guarantees and practical improvements across diverse imaging tasks.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated genomic interpretation system for use in medical and robotic automation, combining key biological concepts with accurate and interpretable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to bridge the gap between genomic modeling and automated decision-making in clinical and robotic contexts by ensuring reliability, interpretability, and efficiency.

Method: The framework uses Chaos Game Representation (CGR) and a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enhanced by techniques like concept fidelity supervision, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration to ensure biological validity and improved predictions.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art classification performance in HIV subtype detection, improves concept prediction fidelity, and provides favorable cost-benefit trade-offs in its recommendations compared to baselines.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust foundation for integrating genomic interpretation into clinical and robotic automation through interpretable, reliable, and efficient decision-making.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

*Angen Ye,Zeyu Zhang,Boyuan Wang,Xiaofeng Wang,Dapeng Zhang,Zheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-R1, a Vision-Language-Action model enhanced with reasoning capabilities using Reinforcement Learning and a new dataset (VLA-CoT-13K) to improve reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current VLA models, which lack explicit reasoning and rely on weak post-training reward designs, impacting their robustness and generalization across tasks and real-world applications.

Method: VLA-R1 integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), introducing rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting. The new dataset, VLA-CoT-13K, is used for chain-of-thought supervision aligned with affordance and trajectory data.

Result: The model demonstrates superior generalization, reasoning robustness, and real-world performance in a variety of scenarios, including in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms.

Conclusion: VLA-R1 advances the field of Vision-Language-Action models by enhancing reasoning and execution capabilities, proving effective across diverse tasks and environments. The open-source release of its model, code, and dataset will further contribute to embodied AI research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

*Yifan Zhao,Liangchen Li,Yuqi Zhou,Kai Wang,Yan Liang,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of defocus blur in macrophotography by proposing a joint method for image deblurring and 3D reconstruction using self-supervised optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defocus blur in macrophotography obstructs clear imaging and high-quality 3D reconstruction of small, detailed objects. Traditional methods require extensive resources and currently lack multi-view 3D reconstruction approaches specific to macrophotography.

Method: The paper introduces a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction framework starting with blurry multi-view images, optimizing the defocus blur kernel and the 3D model using a differentiable rendering technique for self-supervised learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the proposed method successfully achieves high-quality image deblurring as well as high-fidelity 3D reconstruction using a small number of multi-view images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, advancing high-resolution and magnification work in macrophotography by enabling simultaneous image deblurring and detailed 3D modeling.

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model for high-fidelity image motion deblurring that achieves superior performance in comparison to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image motion deblurring suffer from challenges like slow inference times and compromised image fidelity.

Method: The authors reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process and utilize a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to produce a clean image. Blur kernel estimation and adaptive timestep prediction enhance its effectiveness.

Result: FideDiff outperforms previous diffusion-based methods in full-reference metrics and matches state-of-the-art competitor models.

Conclusion: FideDiff paves the way for improved image restoration using pre-trained diffusion models and establishes a strong foundation for applications in industrial settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces solutions for recognizing degraded Chinese bronze inscriptions by developing a new dataset and leveraging a two-stage AI pipeline with specialized MoE adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in automatic recognition of Chinese bronze inscriptions, which are vital for archaeological and historical research but suffer from degradation and variability in visual representation.

Method: The paper curates a large-scale dataset of bronze inscription images and annotated characters, and introduces a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline incorporating LadderMoE for handling domain variability and rare characters.

Result: Their method outperforms existing scene text recognition benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy across different categories and image modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach sets a robust foundation for automatic recognition of bronze inscriptions, enhancing the potential for archaeological studies.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

### [169] [VirDA: Reusing Backbone for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Visual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01660)
*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VirDA, a domain adaptation method using visual reprogramming layers that avoids full backbone fine-tuning, achieving significant parameter efficiency while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of existing UDA pipelines, which require full backbone fine-tuning for each source-target domain pair, leading to increased storage, training parameters, and non-reusability of trained backbones.

Method: VirDA works by introducing a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer that generates visual prompts to adapt the input style to the target domain. This method optimizes these layers using intra- and inter-domain distribution objectives, allowing reuse of backbone parameters without fine-tuning them.

Result: VirDA achieves 92.8% mean accuracy on Office-31 with just 1.5M parameters. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods like PDA (+1.6% accuracy), CDTrans (+0.2%), and FixBi (+1.4%) while using significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: VirDA demonstrates that domain-specific visual reprogramming layers can achieve efficient and effective domain adaptation without full backbone fine-tuning, enabling parameter and memory-efficient UDA pipelines.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised and scalable method to analyze facial expressions using a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems like FACS for facial expression analysis are limited in coverage and require costly manual annotation, creating a need for a more effective and scalable approach.

Method: The authors propose DFE by first employing a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to extract identity-invariant features, followed by encoding these features into discrete tokens through RVQ-VAE, which represent reusable facial deformations.

Result: DFE demonstrates better precision in capturing facial behaviors than FACS and other competitors, excelling in psychological tasks such as stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection.

Conclusion: DFE provides a scalable, precise, and interpretable alternative to traditional facial expression analysis, showing broader coverage and better performance in psychological and affective computing tasks.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

*Yongbo Chen,Yanhao Zhang,Shaifali Parashar,Liang Zhao,Shoudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Con-NRSfM,' a novel method for non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) under conformal deformations. It overcomes existing limitations and achieves improved 3D reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in monocular visual deformable SLAM by enhancing NRSfM, focusing on accurate reconstruction under conformal deformations.

Method: Utilizes a graph-based framework for optimization, decouples depth and conformal scale constraints, and incorporates a self-supervised encoder-decoder for generating textured 3D point clouds.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in both accuracy and robustness, verified through simulations and experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM provides a significant advancement in NRSfM, enabling better depth estimation and reconstruction by eliminating prior assumptions, making it a robust solution for deformable SLAM.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniVerse, a framework leveraging a video diffusion model for robust 3D scene reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D scene reconstruction struggle with inconsistent multi-view images and rely heavily on dense observations for optimization.

Method: UniVerse separates the robust reconstruction task into restoration and reconstruction. It converts inconsistent images into videos, restores them using a video diffusion model, and then reconstructs the 3D scenes from the restored images.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in robust reconstruction across synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and allowing style control for the reconstructed 3D scene.

Conclusion: UniVerse simplifies the optimization process thanks to its decoupled subtasks approach and leverages large-scale data for superior performance and adaptability to diverse inconsistencies.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [173] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient and robust template matching framework that estimates a target's position, rotation, and scaling for industrial inspection, leveraging a lightweight design and a novel template-aware dynamic convolution module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing template matching methods struggle with efficiency during compound transformations and fail to explicitly model geometric poses, which limits their deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.

Method: The proposed method formulates template matching as a joint localization and geometric regression task, introducing a Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module for effective inference and utilizing rotation-shear augmentation with pseudo labels for training.

Result: The framework achieves high precision with a 3.07M parameter model, demonstrating 14ms inference time and robust performance in challenging scenarios like small-template and multi-object cases.

Conclusion: The lightweight and robust design of the framework makes it suitable for real-time industrial inspection and component alignment, addressing the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring deployment practicability.

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for adaptive pixel reasoning in Vision-Language Models to address inefficiency and distraction in visual operations, achieving improved accuracy and reduced tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with tasks that require detailed understanding of fine-grained visual information due to limitations in image encoding and insufficient focus on critical image regions.

Method: The paper introduces a framework combining operation-aware supervised fine-tuning and rollout-guided reinforcement learning to dynamically decide when pixel-level operations are needed based on query difficulty.

Result: The proposed model achieves 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while cutting tool usage to 20.1%, representing a 66.5% reduction in tool usage compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating adaptive pixel reasoning can significantly enhance multimodal reasoning benchmarks, improving both accuracy and efficiency in Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

*Han-Jay Shu,Wei-Ning Chiu,Shun-Ting Chang,Meng-Ping Huang,Takeshi Tohyama,Ahram Han,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ASRS, an augmentation-based error detection framework for detecting errors in chest radiograph (CXR) AI model predictions to improve fairness and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for CXR interpretation demonstrate strong performance but suffer from uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden biases and reliability issues that standard metrics fail to reveal.

Method: The proposed Augmentation-Sensitivity Risk Scoring (ASRS) applies clinically plausible image rotations and evaluates embedding shifts using the RAD-DINO encoder to compute sensitivity scores and identify error-prone CXR samples.

Result: ASRS stratifies CXR samples into stability quartiles, with error-prone cases showing noticeably lower recall even in models with high AUROC and confidence scores.

Conclusion: ASRS is a label-free, effective approach for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and reliability in medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

### [176] [FreeViS: Training-free Video Stylization with Inconsistent References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01686)
*Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Ke Zhang,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeViS is a training-free video stylization framework that ensures rich style details and strong temporal coherence, while being practical and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video stylization is crucial for content creation but faces challenges including temporal inconsistency and limited style richness in current methods.

Method: FreeViS employs a pretrained image-to-video model integrated with multiple stylized references, high-frequency compensation for layout and motion consistency, and flow-based motion cues for texture preservation.

Result: FreeViS achieves higher fidelity in stylization and superior temporal consistency compared to recent baselines, as evidenced by strong human preference and extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: FreeViS provides a practical, economic, and high-quality solution for temporally coherent video stylization without requiring dedicated training.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedQ-Bench introduces a benchmark for evaluating medical image quality using Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a focus on human-like reasoning and perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current medical image quality assessment systems, which rely on scalar metrics and lack descriptive reasoning capabilities akin to expert evaluation.

Method: MedQ-Bench defines two tasks: MedQ-Perception for probing visual attributes and MedQ-Reasoning for assessing reasoning without reference, using five imaging modalities and over 40 attributes. It includes simulated degradations and AI-generated images, with model evaluation based on multi-dimensional judging protocols.

Result: Evaluation of 14 MLLMs revealed preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning capabilities, showing inadequacies for clinical use.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in medical IQA, emphasizing the need for further optimization while encouraging exploration of this domain.

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

*Pierre Musacchio,Hyunmin Lee,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaFormer addresses the challenging task of predicting instance-wise geometries by using RGB images to generate occlusion and depth ordering in a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual models require costly input formats and computational overhead for instance-wise geometry tasks.

Method: InstaFormer leverages object queries and latent mask descriptors to represent objects semantically while complementing their information.

Result: InstaFormer efficiently predicts occlusion and depth orderings in scenes from RGB images with reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: The method showcases effectiveness in benchmarking tasks, offering a streamlined and more affordable approach to instance geometry prediction.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyramidStyler, a transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding and reinforcement learning, improves Neural Style Transfer in terms of scalability, efficiency, and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Neural Style Transfer (NST) models struggle with scaling to complex styles and high-resolution inputs efficiently.

Method: Introduces PyramidStyler with Pyramidal Positional Encoding for multi-scale feature capture and reinforcement learning for dynamic stylization optimization.

Result: Achieved significant reduction in content and style loss (62.6% and 57.4%) and improved rendering quality and speed during inference.

Conclusion: PyramidStyler offers real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with applications in media and design, outperforming prior NST models.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoBE-GS, an optimized 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for large-scale scene reconstruction, achieving faster training and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and challenges of scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to large and unbounded scenes, such as imbalanced partitions and high overhead in pipelines.

Method: LoBE-GS employs depth-aware partitioning, optimization-based load balancing of visible Gaussians, and lightweight techniques like visibility cropping and selective densification.

Result: LoBE-GS achieves up to 2x faster end-to-end training time compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS effectively re-engineers 3DGS pipelines to balance computational loads, reduce preprocessing time, and improve efficiency and scalability for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in long-form video generation with two innovations: MemoryPack for dynamic context modeling and Direct Forcing to reduce error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to create models capable of handling long-range dependencies and mitigating error accumulation in autoregressive long-form video generation.

Method: Proposes MemoryPack, a learnable dynamic context mechanism, and Direct Forcing, which improves alignment between training and inference.

Result: The integration of MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially improves minute-level temporal consistency and reduces errors during inference.

Conclusion: The two techniques presented advance the reliability and practical usability of autoregressive models for generating long-form videos.

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

*Cornelius Schröder,Marius-Raphael Schlüter,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve confidence calibration in 3D object detectors crucial for autonomous systems, focusing on dominant and secondary class predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving confidence calibration of 3D object detectors is necessary for autonomous systems to ensure safe and reliable operation.

Method: The authors introduce two auxiliary regularizing loss terms targeting dominant and full predictive confidence distributions and evaluate various calibration techniques on 3D object detection models.

Result: Combining the proposed loss term and isotonic regression achieves optimal calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet, while DSVT-Pillar struggles with joint calibration across dominant and secondary predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve calibration performance, but challenges remain for specific models like DSVT-Pillar in achieving comprehensive joint calibration.

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

*Giyeol Kim,Sooyoung Yang,Jihyong Oh,Myungjoo Kang,Chanho Eom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study addresses person search by introducing the DiffPS framework, which relies on a pre-trained diffusion model and specialized modules to optimize person detection and identification, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current person search methods rely on ImageNet pre-trained backbones that fall short in capturing detailed spatial and identity information. Additionally, shared backbone features cause optimization conflicts in person detection and re-identification.

Method: DiffPS leverages a pre-trained diffusion model and proposes three modules: Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for better localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to combat shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) for leveraging diffusion features.

Result: DiffPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Conclusion: By introducing a diffusion model with specialized modules, the DiffPS framework eliminates optimization conflicts in person search and improves the integration of spatial and identity features.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

TL;DR: Hyperspectral imaging has challenges in reconstruction quality due to hardware limitations. The proposed FMU method integrates flow matching into HSI reconstruction and achieves better performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing hyperspectral imaging data is difficult due to degradation and loss during compression, requiring improved methods for quality enhancement.

Method: The proposed FMU embeds flow matching within a deep unfolding framework and incorporates a mean velocity loss for better consistency and robustness.

Result: FMU achieves significant improvement in reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, validated through experiments on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: FMU successfully combines optimization-based interpretability with generative flow matching to advance hyperspectral imaging reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect detection in conventional industry components is labor-intensive, burdens quality inspection personnel, and hampers effective product quality management.

Method: A defect detection system using deep learning (YOLO models) combined with ConSinGAN for generating additional data to address insufficient defective images.

Result: YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN achieves superior performance with 95.50% accuracy and detection time of 285 ms, outperforming other models and threshold-based methods.

Conclusion: The automated system is highly adaptable for detecting various types of defects, even in cases of limited defect data, providing a significant improvement in industrial defect detection processes.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoundAD, a few-shot anomaly detector leveraging foundation visual encoders to identify anomalies in images accurately using fewer parameters and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve industrial safety inspection by addressing the challenges of few-shot anomaly detection, particularly under category-agnostic conditions.

Method: Design a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold using embeddings from large-scale pre-trained visual encoders to identify anomalies effectively.

Result: FoundAD demonstrates competitive performance in multi-class detection using fewer parameters and tests effectively across multiple foundation encoders, including DINOv3.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances few-shot anomaly detection, supporting accurate, efficient multi-class anomaly identification.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

*Fabio Montello,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClustViT, a Vision Transformer architecture optimized for semantic segmentation by clustering tokens during processing, achieving faster inference and reduced computational complexity without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of Vision Transformers limits their applicability in real-world robotic systems, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: ClustViT introduces trainable modules: a Cluster module to merge similar tokens guided by segmentation masks, and a Regenerator module to restore fine details, combining token efficiency and accurate predictions.

Result: ClustViT achieves up to 2.18x reduced GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three datasets, while maintaining comparable semantic segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: ClustViT offers an efficient Vision Transformer adaptation for semantic segmentation tasks, balancing computational efficiency with performance, and is a practical step towards real-world applicability.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Patch-as-Decodable Token" (PaDT), a new framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate both textual and visual outputs directly, improving their capabilities in dense prediction vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in multimodal large language models struggle with performance and flexibility, particularly for dense visual tasks like segmentation.

Method: PaDT uses Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs) derived from patch embeddings of images, interleaves them with textual tokens, and employs a lightweight decoder to generate diverse predictions. It also applies a tailored training strategy involving random token selection and per-token cross-entropy loss.

Result: PaDT demonstrates state-of-the-art results across four visual perception and understanding tasks, outperforming significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT bridges the gap between text and dense visual tasks in MLLMs and offers a more effective and scalable paradigm for multimodal outputs, with code publicly available for replication and further improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a trust-building model for online fruit and vegetable transactions, emphasizing quality assessment, algorithm transparency, and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trust deficit in online fresh produce e-commerce caused by the lack of sensory product inspection.

Method: The study develops a 'Trust Pyramid' model, proposes the Triangular Trust Index (TTI), and creates the explainable AI framework TriAlignXA with three engines and a Pre-Mapping Mechanism for encoding process data.

Result: The proposed model achieves significantly higher grading accuracy and demonstrates the ability to balance the trade-offs in the 'impossible triangle' of product grading.

Conclusion: The research offers a robust theoretical and practical framework to establish consumer trust and transparency in online produce transactions.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: Introduces 4DGS-Craft, a unified framework for consistent and user-friendly editing of 4D Gaussian Splatting scenes. Utilizes geometry-aware models, multi-view enhancements, and LLM-based user instruction handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in view, temporal consistency, and handling complex user interactions during 4D Gaussian Splatting editing.

Method: Deploys a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model with geometry features, multi-view grid modules for iterative refinement, Gaussian selection mechanisms for non-edited regions, and LLM-based tools for user intent decoding.

Result: Proposed framework achieves better consistency, interpretability, and performance for editing 4D scenes compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft provides a dependable solution for consistent 4D scene editing and effective user interaction, with plans for code release upon approval.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Junyu Wu,Jie Tang,Jie Liu,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Pure-Pass (PP)', a pixel-level masking mechanism, to improve the efficiency and performance of image super-resolution (SR) models, achieving better results with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing SR methods, like CAMixer, in terms of computational inefficiency, poor adaptability, and inflexibility while ensuring high reconstruction quality.

Method: Introduces the Pure-Pass (PP) mechanism, which uses pixel-level masking via fixed color center points to identify and exclude pure pixels from expensive computations, providing fine-grained adaptability.

Result: When integrated with the ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieved superior reconstruction quality and higher parameter efficiency compared to CAMixer-ATD-light, with similar computational savings.

Conclusion: The Pure-Pass mechanism enables more efficient and effective SR by reducing unnecessary computation, demonstrating significant advantages over existing models like CAMixer.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study utilizes GPT-4's multimodal capabilities alongside a Self-correction Loop framework (SLSO) to enhance automated dental panoramic radiograph analysis, achieving improved accuracy in certain aspects despite dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to address the challenges of automated identification and description of jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs, specifically improving output accuracy and suppressing errors like hallucinations.

Method: A 10-step process was implemented using the SLSO framework for radiograph analysis, involving iterative corrections, structured output consistency checks, and comparative experiments with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method.

Result: SLSO improved accuracy for output items such as tooth number (66.9%), tooth movement (33.3%), and root resorption (28.6%). Consistent output was achieved after five regenerations in successful cases, but limitations persisted for extensive lesions.

Conclusion: The SLSO framework showcases potential in enhancing radiograph analysis through structured corrections, though statistical significance was limited due to a small dataset. Further refinement is needed for practical applications.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a lightweight model that accurately reconstructs LiDAR point clouds with strong generalization capabilities.

Method: LiLa-Net uses reduced layers, simplified skip connections, and leverages a balance between latent encoding and skip connections information.

Result: LiLa-Net effectively reconstructs original point clouds with high quality and demonstrates generalization to unrelated objects.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net achieves efficient latent space representation and reconstruction accuracy while minimizing computational resources and generalizing well to diverse objects.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces kabr-tools, an open-source machine learning-based framework that uses drone footage to analyze complex animal behaviors, demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional field-based methods for quantifying animal behavior are time-consuming, limited in scope, and labor-intensive, restricting the ability to assess comprehensive and large-scale behavioral ecology.

Method: The authors developed kabr-tools, a framework integrating drone-based video footage with machine learning techniques, including object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification, to analyze multidimensional metrics of animal behavior.

Result: Drone-based observations using kabr-tools reduced visibility loss by 15%, enabled capturing more behavioral transitions with greater accuracy, and provided robust metrics validated via case studies with zebras and giraffes.

Conclusion: kabr-tools enables scalable, automated behavioral monitoring, advancing ecological research, conservation efforts, and biodiversity studies through improved analysis of spatial and behavioral dynamics in wildlife.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents GaussianMorphing, a method for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing using high-fidelity geometry and unsupervised semantic correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for 3D morphing depend heavily on point clouds and pre-defined mappings, limiting their utility for accurate textured data and semantic-aware modeling.

Method: GaussianMorphing leverages mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting with topology-aware constraints and a unified deformation strategy anchored to reconstructed mesh patches, enabling consistent geometric and texture transformations without supervised data.

Result: The method outperforms previous 2D/3D morphing techniques, achieving a 22.2% reduction in color consistency error (ΔE) and a 26.2% reduction in EI on the TexMorph benchmark.

Conclusion: GaussianMorphing introduces an efficient unsupervised framework that combines semantic coherence, geometric fidelity, and topology-aware texture consistency for 3D morphing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

*Sahil Bhandary Karnoor,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InPose method addresses pose estimation using rotational measurements combined with a pre-trained diffusion model for better zero-shot generalization across users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is critical but challenging due to limitations in the number of body sensors and user-specific variances in measurement data.

Method: The paper proposes InPose, a generative pose estimation approach conditioned only on rotational measurements while utilizing priors from a pre-trained diffusion model guided by a likelihood derived from measured locations.

Result: The InPose method demonstrates robust estimation of poses across users without relying heavily on location measurements.

Conclusion: InPose improves zero-shot generalization in pose estimation by addressing the limitations in location-based approaches and effectively leveraging rotational measurements and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of convolutional architectures like U-Net in capturing long-range dependencies in MRI for accurate brain tumor detection and segmentation.

Method: The proposed VGDM embeds a vision transformer into a diffusion model to integrate global contextual understanding with iterative denoising, enhancing volumetric and boundary precision.

Result: VGDM achieved improved performance metrics, such as increased Dice similarity and better Hausdorff distance, when validated on MRI brain tumor datasets.

Conclusion: This novel approach demonstrates potential in surpassing traditional methods in neuro-oncology imaging, offering improved accuracy and robustness for tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to generate a national-scale urban footprint dataset for France (1925-1950) using deep learning techniques with historical maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of comprehensive digital urban footprint data for France before the 1970s, which is crucial for understanding long-term urbanization trends.

Method: The researchers used a dual-pass U-Net deep learning approach to process historical maps with high radiometric and stylistic complexity. The first pass involved preliminary mapping and identification of areas requiring augmentation, while the second pass refined the data and minimized noise. The pipeline was scalable and deployed on a computing cluster.

Result: The method processed 941 high-resolution tiles covering all of metropolitan France, achieving an accuracy of 73%. It effectively identified diverse urban patterns and overcame common challenges like map labels and contour lines.

Conclusion: This study contributes an open-access urban footprint dataset for 1925-1950 France, methodology for historical map analysis, and resources to aid researchers studying urbanization.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

Motivation: The motivations are to understand the reliability of point-based tracking in complex surgical environments and uncover its failure cases, especially given its low-cost and efficient attributes.

Method: The study systematically compares point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization across laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos focusing on three target areas: gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery.

Result: Point-based tracking performs competitively for tool segmentation but underperforms for anatomical targets due to issues like tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.

Conclusion: The authors present actionable recommendations for improving point-based tracking by optimizing the selection and placement of tracking points in surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

### [200] [FRIEREN: Federated Learning with Vision-Language Regularization for Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02114)
*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFREEDG, a federated learning task for semantic segmentation without labeled client data, and proposes the FRIEREN framework using Vision Foundation Models and Vision-Language integration to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy challenges in federated learning for semantic segmentation when client data is unlabeled, and existing methods assume overly idealized conditions or fail to utilize Vision Foundation Models.

Method: The paper proposes FRIEREN, a framework utilizing Vision-Language decoders guided by CLIP-based text embeddings and a weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy to improve semantic segmentation without labeled client data.

Result: Experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that FRIEREN performs effectively, achieving competitive results against domain generalization and adaptation methods.

Conclusion: FRIEREN sets a new baseline for federated semantic segmentation tasks, showing the potential of Vision-Language integration for this challenging scenario.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

### [201] [Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155)
*Shu Zou,Xinyu Tian,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint is a structured prompting framework for video anomaly detection that leverages action-centric knowledge for accurate and interpretable reasoning with frozen vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve video anomaly detection by utilizing fine-grained action semantics and human-object interactions overlooked in existing prompts.

Method: ASK-Hint organizes prompts into semantic groups aligned with specific anomalies and uses detailed guiding questions to elicit discriminative visual cues from frozen VLMs.

Result: ASK-Hint achieves state-of-the-art AUC performance on benchmarks like UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, showing strong accuracy, generalization, and interpretability.

Conclusion: ASK-Hint emphasizes the importance of granular prompting for better anomaly detection, offering a generalizable, training-free framework with interpretable results.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

### [202] [GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02186)
*Weijia Dou,Xu Zhang,Yi Bin,Jian Liu,Bo Peng,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoPurify, a method addressing inefficiencies in transferring features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation, focusing on geometric coherence without requiring extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of noisy predictions and high costs associated with transferring 2D VLM features into 3D semantic segmentation, which typically require large-scale 3D annotated data and computationally expensive pipelines.

Method: The proposed GeoPurify utilizes a Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-produced 3D point features with geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. Additionally, a Geometry-Guided Pooling module is used during inference to denoise the point cloud and maintain semantic and structural consistency.

Result: GeoPurify exhibits superior data efficiency and achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on major 3D benchmarks with only 1.5% of the training data.

Conclusion: GeoPurify effectively reconciles 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure, mitigating the trade-offs inherent in existing methods and demonstrating its efficacy in reducing the need for large-scale annotated data while maintaining high-level performance.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

*Villanelle O'Reilly,Jonathan Cox,Georgios Leontidis,Marc Hanheide,Petra Bosilj,James Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multicategory counting framework using vision transformers and a novel counting head, achieving superior accuracy in crowd counting benchmarks and opening applications in areas like biodiversity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counting objects in dense and occluded scenes is challenging with traditional detection methods. The study aims to improve multicategory counting for better accuracy in such scenarios.

Method: The method employs a Twins pyramid vision transformer backbone, a multiscale decoding counting head, and a segmentation-based Category Focus Module that suppresses inter-category interference during training.

Result: When tested on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks, the framework reduced Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 33%, 43%, and 64% compared to prior methods, and showed better applicability for biodiversity monitoring datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach not only surpasses existing multi-category counting methods but also introduces innovative applications for ecological and conservation efforts.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

*Shira Schiber,Ofir Lindenbaum,Idan Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TempoControl, a method for fine-grained temporal control in text-to-video generative models, utilizing cross-attention maps with no extra retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of temporal control in existing generative video models, enabling users to specify when visual elements appear in generated videos.

Method: The authors propose TempoControl, which relies on cross-attention maps in text-to-video diffusion models. It employs a novel optimization that aligns temporal elements using correlation, energy, and entropy principles.

Result: TempoControl achieves precise temporal alignment of visual concepts while maintaining high video quality across various applications, including reordering objects and generating action-aligned sequences.

Conclusion: TempoControl is an effective solution for temporal control in text-to-video generation, improving usability and application diversity without requiring additional model retraining or supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

### [205] [RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240)
*Sicheng Feng,Kaiwen Tuo,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Jianke Zhu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RewardMap, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework, to tackle challenges in fine-grained visual reasoning tasks. By constructing an extended dataset called ReasonMap-Plus and designing new reward mechanisms, the framework significantly enhances multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in spatial and fine-grained reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have difficulty with fine-grained visual reasoning, especially in structured, detail-rich environments like transit maps. Sparse rewards and unstable optimization hinder progress in reinforcement learning for these complex tasks.

Method: The authors construct ReasonMap-Plus, a dataset with dense reward signals via visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and propose RewardMap, which features (1) difficulty-aware reward designs and (2) a multi-stage RL training scheme that progresses from simple to complex tasks.

Result: The proposed framework consistently improves performance, achieving a 3.47% average gain across six benchmarks. This includes areas like spatial reasoning, visual reasoning, and tasks beyond transit maps.

Conclusion: RewardMap demonstrates that combining dense rewards and a multi-stage training strategy significantly enhances MLLMs' fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning abilities, offering a practical solution to existing challenges.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

### [206] [DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253)
*Zihan Zhou,Shilin Lu,Shuli Leng,Shaocong Zhang,Zhuming Lian,Xinlei Yu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DragFlow, a framework that effectively uses FLUX's generative priors for drag-based image editing, significantly outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image editing tasks, especially drag-based methods, are hindered by distortions due to insufficient generative priors in earlier models like Stable Diffusion. Recent advancements like FLUX offer stronger priors, but these have not yet been utilized for drag-based editing.

Method: The paper introduces a region-based editing paradigm using FLUX. It employs affine transformations for feature supervision, subject consistency improvements via pretrained adapters, background preservation through gradient masks, and task ambiguity resolution with multimodal large language models. Additionally, a novel benchmark (ReD Bench) is proposed for evaluation.

Result: DragFlow delivers substantial gains in drag-based editing performance. Experiments on curated benchmarks like DragBench-DR and ReD Bench demonstrate that DragFlow outperforms both point-based and region-based baselines.

Conclusion: DragFlow sets a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing by leveraging stronger generative priors and introducing region-based paradigms, showcasing significant advancements in the field.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

*Guangyu Sun,Archit Singhal,Burak Uzkent,Mubarak Shah,Chen Chen,Garin Kessler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of understanding long-form videos in Video Large Language Models (VLMs) by proposing a novel frame selection approach that maintains temporal coherence while balancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with handling the massive number of visual tokens in videos, creating limitations in efficiently understanding motion and event continuity.

Method: The authors introduce a 'key clips' selection method that captures short temporally coherent video segments, alongside an adaptive resolution strategy to limit computational costs by balancing spatial resolution and clip length.

Result: Their training-free method, F2C, improves video understanding performance on benchmarks such as Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU by up to 10.3%.

Conclusion: Temporal coherence is vital for effective video understanding in VLMs, and the proposed F2C approach presents a scalable pathway for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates video-based 3D human pose estimation models against inertial measurement units (IMUs) using a dataset of daily activities to analyze their accuracy and trade-offs. MotionAGFormer performed the best among the video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to accurately assess human movement in real-world conditions for applications like telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation, especially outside specialized laboratories.

Method: The study used the VIDIMU dataset consisting of 13 daily activities recorded via video cameras and IMUs. Various video-based deep learning models were compared to IMU-derived joint angle data using OpenSim inverse kinematics.

Result: MotionAGFormer outperformed other video-based models, achieving the lowest RMSE and MAE values and the highest Pearson correlation and $R^{2}$ scores, suggesting promising kinematic assessment in healthy adults.

Conclusion: Although both video- and IMU-based methods are viable for out-of-lab use, the study highlights trade-offs such as cost and precision, providing guidance for developing effective telehealth and remote monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroSwift integrates adapters for decoding fMRI data, enabling cross-subject visual stimuli reconstruction with minimal computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity, particularly due to inter-subject variability and abstract semantic encoding in the brain.

Method: NeuroSwift utilizes complementary adapters: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantic understanding, leveraging diffusion models. It involves pretraining on one subject and fine-tuning minimal parameters for cross-subject adaptation.

Result: NeuroSwift achieves state-of-the-art cross-subject reconstruction performance with only one hour of training on lightweight GPUs, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift offers significant advancement in reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI data by reducing computational demands and improving cross-subject accuracy.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

*Sathira Silva,Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes microCLIP, an unsupervised self-training framework to improve fine-grained image classification by refining CLIP-based vision-language models using fine-grained cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's heavy reliance on global features limits its performance in fine-grained classification tasks, necessitating an approach sensitive to fine-grained, localized image details.

Method: The presented framework microCLIP uses Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module for saliency-guided alignment and a two-headed classifier for stabilization. Additionally, Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation refines pseudo-labels iteratively by combining fixed and evolving logits.

Result: MicroCLIP shows notable performance improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 2.90% across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring minimal adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully uncovers fine-grained signals in CLIP, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing fine-grained image classification in an unsupervised setting.

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1 represents a significant step forward in detecting AI-generated videos, balancing high accuracy with the need for transparency for end users and regulators.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for long-horizon video generation addressing quality degradation without requiring extended training or supervision from teacher models synthesizing long video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs and quality degradation in long-horizon video generation due to compounded errors in the latent space.

Method: The approach leverages teacher models by extracting guidance from segments of self-generated long videos, preserving temporal consistency while avoiding overlapping frames' recomputation.

Result: The method scales video generation length up to 20x beyond teacher capabilities, producing videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds while outperforming baseline approaches in fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a significant advancement in long video generation, overcoming limitations of current models without extensive retraining, demonstrating competitive performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon

*David Romero,Ariana Bermudez,Hao Li,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMask is a physics-guided video generation approach addressing physically plausible object interactions in scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with realistic object interactions and lack physics-based control mechanisms.

Method: KineMask employs a two-stage training strategy removing future motion supervision via object masks, integrating motion control with textual conditioning.

Result: It achieves improvements in video generation for object interactions and dynamic phenomena over recent models of similar size.

Conclusion: KineMask enhances video generation with physics-grounded control, enabling realistic interactions and motions in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces fine-grained multimodal sensory inputs to enhance real-time precise control in video models for applications like household robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time precise motor control in general-purpose household robots to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations.

Method: The authors develop a feature learning paradigm aligning multimodal sensory modalities (proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation) while preserving unique modality information, with a regularization scheme enhancing action trajectory causality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved simulation accuracy, reduced temporal drift, and effective application in downstream tasks with multimodal sensory integration.

Conclusion: Fine-grained multimodal senses are practical and effective for enhancing interaction dynamics, as validated by ablation studies and applications.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

*Enxin Song,Wenhao Chai,Shusheng Yang,Ethan Armand,Xiaojun Shan,Haiyang Xu,Jianwen Xie,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents VideoNSA, an adapted method to improve long-video understanding in multimodal language models by using Native Sparse Attention combined with dense attention for text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve video understanding in multimodal language models, which often struggle with coherence and capturing key frames due to limited context length.

Method: VideoNSA combines Native Sparse Attention for video data with dense attention for text data in Qwen2.5-VL, trained on a large video instruction dataset and optimized for long-video processing.

Result: VideoNSA achieved better performance on benchmarks related to long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial comprehension compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights scalable token processing, optimal attention allocation patterns, task-dependent performance improvements, and the benefits of dynamic attention mechanisms for video-language understanding.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

*Ruozhen He,Moayed Haji-Ali,Ziyan Yang,Vicente Ordonez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoiseShift, a training-free method to improve the quality of text-to-image generation on lower resolutions by recalibrating noise levels based on resolution size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inability of text-to-image models trained on fixed resolutions to generalize effectively at lower resolutions, leading to inefficient resource utilization and diminished image quality.

Method: NoiseShift adjusts the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on the resolution size, without requiring changes to the model architecture or sampling schedule.

Result: Applying NoiseShift to three models—Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev—shows significant quality improvements in low-resolution generation, with increases in FID performance on datasets like LAION-COCO and CelebA.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively mitigates resolution-dependent artifacts, enhances performance across models, and provides a simple, architecture-independent solution to improve low-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

*Guanqi Zhan,Xianzheng Ma,Weidi Xie,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines predicting dynamic physical properties, like elasticity, viscosity, and friction, from videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer complex physical properties requiring temporal information from visual data.

Method: Three approaches are explored: an oracle using predefined cues, a readout mechanism using prompts in video models, and prompting strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models.

Result: Video foundation models deliver comparable results to an oracle, but MLLMs perform worse while showing potential for improvement through targeting prompting.

Conclusion: Video foundation models and crafted prompts hold promise for physical property estimation, but MLLMs require optimization for better performance.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task and method for identifying objects involved in interactions based on their unique sounds, using multimodal object-aware models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate whether models can link sounds from everyday object interactions to the objects directly involved, as humans can.

Method: A multimodal framework trained with egocentric video data is proposed. It includes segmentation masks to guide focus and a slot attention visual encoder to prioritize object-centric learning.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on their proposed task and existing multimodal action understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study successfully presents a new task of sounding object detection and demonstrates the effectiveness of object-centric multimodal learning for this purpose.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for novel view synthesis and introduces a density-guided poisoning method to stealthily embed viewpoint-dependent objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the weaknesses in 3D scene representation methods, particularly their susceptibility to image-level poisoning attacks, and enhance their robustness.

Method: The proposed method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). It uses an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency and introduces a KDE-based evaluation protocol.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed poisoning method is more effective than state-of-the-art techniques in embedding illusory objects with minimal impact on non-targeted views.

Conclusion: The study successfully highlights vulnerabilities in 3DGS and offers a robust method to evaluate and improve attack strategies, paving the way for future research to enhance novel view synthesis security.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### [220] [Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02315)
*Eric Tillmann Bill,Enis Simsar,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework and practical algorithms to improve multi-subject fidelity in text-to-image (T2I) models, leveraging stochastic optimal control and flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions in T2I models when handling multi-subject descriptions.

Method: The approach uses flow matching within a stochastic optimal control framework to disentangle subjects, proposing two algorithms: (i) a test-time controller that adjusts velocity with a single update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching for fine-tuning a control network while preserving base model functions.

Result: Both algorithms improve multi-subject alignment on models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, with efficient test-time performance and generalizable fine-tuned controllers.

Conclusion: The paper delivers state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity via the proposed FOCUS framework, offering an impactful contribution to T2I modeling across different architectures.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

*Preston Vander Vos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Odontoceti, a DAG-based blockchain consensus protocol, reduces latency to 300ms and enhances throughput to 10,000 transactions/second while operating at 20% fault tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues in blockchains by reducing latency and improving transaction processing speed.

Method: Introduced Odontoceti with a two-round commitment process, operating at a 20% fault tolerance using n = 5f + 1 validators and a novel block commitment rule.

Result: Achieved 300ms latency, 10,000 transactions/second throughput under realistic conditions, and 20-25% latency improvements over existing protocols.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical viability of lower fault tolerance (20%) protocols, emphasizing latency and throughput benefits for blockchain scalability.

Abstract: Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and
immediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based
consensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high
throughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20%
fault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based
protocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering
median latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per
second under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1
validators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for
committing blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress
when participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more
common in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25%
latency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating
that reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful
performance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower
fault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains.

Motivation: To address challenges faced by traditional scheduling systems in managing resource utilization and efficiency for large-scale AI workloads, particularly in clusters focused on LLM training and inference.

Method: The paper defines practical evaluation metrics (e.g., GAR, SOR, etc.), and proposes scheduling strategies like Backfill and Enhanced Binpack. Kant was engineered and implemented for deployment, enabling co-scheduling of workloads in AI clusters.

Result: Kant significantly enhances GPU utilization and scheduling efficiency, reduces resource fragmentation, and reliably supports workloads in clusters ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs.

Conclusion: Kant provides a scalable and efficient scheduling platform that improves AI-native infrastructure, ensuring stable performance in large-scale intelligent computing environments.

Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for
large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly,
traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing
resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper
presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed
for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both
training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant
system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI
clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate
(SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution
(JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a
foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results
demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from
hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such
as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves
resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing
resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The
system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably
supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a
practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available,
AI-native scheduling infrastructure.

Result: IoT-MCP achieved 100% success in executing tool calls, accurate results, 205ms response time, and a 74KB memory footprint across experiments involving 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units.

Conclusion: IoT-MCP effectively bridges LLMs and IoT systems, providing an open-source framework and standardized benchmarking tool for evaluation.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT)
systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control

providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We
propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed

introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g.,
``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel
so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation
across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100%
task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and
obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak

*Hasan Heydari,Alysson Bessani,Kartik Nayak*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents QScale, a distributed ledger protocol optimized for moderate-scale systems with efficient communication and low latency while ensuring safety and liveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed ledger protocols either perform well for small or large-scale systems but fail to efficiently support moderate-sized systems ranging from hundreds to a thousand processes.

Method: The proposed method, QScale, achieves sub-linear communication complexity per process and sub-quadratic total communication complexity. It ensures safety and liveness with high probability, while maintaining low latency and scalability through a communication-efficient design.

Result: QScale achieves $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication complexity per process per-block, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total communication complexity per-block, and best-case latency of $O(\kappa)$ rounds.

Conclusion: QScale addresses the gap in distributed ledger protocols for moderate-scale systems by ensuring efficient communication, scalability, and low latency, making it suitable for systems like Redbelly and Sui.

Abstract: Existing distributed ledger protocols either incur a high communication
complexity and are thus suited to systems with a small number of processes
(e.g., PBFT), or rely on committee-sampling-based approaches that only work for
a very large number of processes (e.g., Algorand). Neither of these lines of
work is well-suited for moderate-scale distributed ledgers ranging from a few
hundred to a thousand processes, which are common in production (e.g, Redbelly,
Sui). The goal of this work is to design a distributed ledger with sub-linear
communication complexity per process, sub-quadratic total communication
complexity, and low latency for finalizing a block into the ledger, such that
it can be used for moderate-scale systems. We propose QScale, a protocol in
which every process incurs only $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication
complexity per-block in expectation, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total
communication complexity per-block in expectation, and a best-case latency of
$O(\kappa)$ rounds while ensuring safety and liveness with overwhelming
probability, with $\kappa$ being a small security parameter.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-latency scheduling algorithm for DNN offloading on mobile edge devices, enhancing performance under high workloads and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle latency issues and optimize task scheduling for DNN offloading in mobile edge devices under deadline constraints.

Method: Developing a scheduling algorithm using lightweight network state representation, resource availability abstraction, network discretisation, and dynamic bandwidth estimation.

Result: The system demonstrated improved performance in high-volume workload scenarios, enhancing task throughput via the dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism.

Conclusion: The novel scheduling method outperforms existing approaches in reducing latency and increasing efficiency for deadline-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for low-latency deadline-constrained DNN
offloading on mobile edge devices. We design a scheduling algorithm with
lightweight network state representation, considering device availability,
communication on the network link, priority-aware pre-emption, and task
deadlines. The scheduling algorithm aims to reduce latency by designing a
resource availability representation, as well as a network discretisation and a
dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism. We implement the scheduling algorithm
into a system composed of four Raspberry Pi 2 (model Bs) mobile edge devices,
sampling a waste classification conveyor belt at a set frame rate. The system
is evaluated and compared to a previous approach of ours, which was proven to
outcompete work-stealers and a non-pre-emption based scheduling heuristic under
the aforementioned waste classification scenario. Our findings show the novel
lower latency abstraction models yield better performance under high-volume
workloads, with the dynamic bandwidth estimation assisting the task placement
while, ultimately, increasing task throughput in times of resource scarcity.

Motivation: RISC-V accelerators are emerging with potential for HPC workloads, but their bespoke programming models pose challenges for existing complex Fortran-based scientific computing codes.

Method: The authors propose using an approach to interface RISC-V architectures with Fortran, eliminating the need for code redevelopment.

Conclusion: This approach allows for leveraging the capabilities of RISC-V accelerators in scientific computing while preserving the existing Fortran codes, enhancing usability and adoption in the field.

Abstract: A range of RISC-V based accelerators are available and coming to market, and
there is strong potential for these to be used for High Performance Computing
(HPC) workloads. However, such accelerators tend to provide bespoke programming
models and APIs that require codes to be rewritten. In scientific computing,
where many of the simulation code are highly complex, extensive, and written in

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to make molecular dynamics simulations faster by using time-series forecasting to predict atomic motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DFT methods are computationally expensive, making long-term simulations impractical in materials science and biophysics.

Method: The approach uses time-series forecasting for atomic trajectories, employs physics-informed mechanisms with DFT-parametrized Morse potential functions, and enforces physical plausibility with penalties for inaccuracies.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in accuracy across diverse materials and enables stable modeling of thousands of MD steps within minutes.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics knowledge in machine learning enhances simulation reliability, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional DFT models.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the limited ability of temperature-based sampling to enhance output diversity without sacrificing precision for tasks like mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Selective sampling effectively enhances creative diversity while maintaining reasoning accuracy, with low latency impact on language models.

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

### [229] [Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01235)
*Subham Ghosh,Abhishek Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-driven pipeline to autonomously extract thermoelectric and structural data from 10,000 scientific articles, resulting in the largest curated dataset to date. The approach is benchmarked with GPT-4.1 models and released via an interactive web explorer for data exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of large, machine-readable experimental datasets coupling performance metrics and structural context, which constrains rapid materials discovery.

Method: The workflow integrates dynamic token allocation, zero-shot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing. It benchmarks GPT-4.1 models for performance and uses this technique to curate the dataset.

Result: The pipeline yields 27,822 temperature-resolved property records along with structural attributes. GPT-4.1 achieves high extraction accuracy, and the dataset reproduces known thermoelectric trends while surfacing new structure-property correlations.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, cost-effective dataset extraction tool, demonstrating its utility in thermoelectrics and setting a foundation for broader data-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [230] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ is a novel low-bit quantization framework for large language models, introducing geometry-driven innovations to improve performance under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models perform well, their large parameter size makes deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging, necessitating effective low-bit quantization methods.

Method: RSAVQ employs two innovations: Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance, which projects quantization errors to low-sensitivity directions using a Fisher Information Matrix-based approach, and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance, which dynamically allocates bits based on channel-wise sensitivity metrics.

Result: RSAVQ outperforms baseline quantization methods, achieving improvements in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy metrics, such as a 0.4 PPL and 1.5 accuracy gain on tasks like 2-bit quantization for LLaMA-3 8B.

Conclusion: RSAVQ advances LLM quantization in constrained environments, bridging theoretical insights from information geometry with practical deployment outcomes in deep learning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: Federated learning's defense against poisoning and backdoor attacks is formulated as a sequential decision problem, solved with a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that balances robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces vulnerabilities from poisoning and backdoor attacks, especially under partial observability, and requires effective defensive strategies.

Method: Formulates defense as a partially observable sequential decision problem, employing a trust-aware Deep Q-Network to integrate evidence into trust updates and optimize robustness–accuracy objectives.

Result: Experiments show accuracy improvement and mitigation of attack success rates under various settings, with DQN outperforming alternative controllers.

Conclusion: The proposed trust-aware DQN achieves an effective trade-off between robustness and accuracy, even under reduced observability and weaker signals.

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

*Koyena Chowdhury,Paramita Koley,Abhijnan Chakraborty,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSTGCN, a novel method for predicting average train delays at railway stations, along with a dataset for the Indian Railway Network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting train delays at a station level supports efficient railway scheduling and traffic management, shifting focus from individual train delay prediction.

Method: The authors developed the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN) with innovative features like train frequency-aware spatial attention.

Result: The proposed RSTGCN significantly enhances predictive performance in delay forecasting, aided by experiments across state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The paper advances railway delay prediction, offers an open dataset, and invites further research into large-scale rail network traffic management.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compositional meta-learning model that combines neural networks' expressivity with probabilistic inference's data efficiency to rapidly learn new tasks using minimal experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving new tasks with minimal data by reusing knowledge through effective compositional frameworks in meta-learning.

Method: The method involves learning a generative model to represent tasks as combinations of reusable computations, transforming task learning into probabilistic inference for efficient and parameter-free solutions.

Result: The model efficiently recovers ground truth components in rule and motor learning tasks and shows the capability to infer solutions quickly from single examples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a powerful synthesis of neural networks and probabilistic inference for highly efficient and flexible meta-learning.

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

### [234] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Budgeted Broadcast (BB), a novel pruning strategy that optimizes coding entropy and sparsity, improving performance across various models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods often rank parameters based on their impact on loss without addressing redundancy in parameter usage. The authors aim to improve pruning strategies by incorporating local traffic budgeting to create a balance between parameter selectivity and propagation.

Method: The paper introduces Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which assigns a traffic budget to each unit based on its activity and fan-out. A constrained-entropy analysis is used, and pruning decisions are made locally to enforce a balance between selectivity and audience, maximizing coding entropy under a global traffic budget.

Result: BB increases coding entropy, decorrelation, and accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. It achieves performance improvements across diverse architectures (Transformers, ResNets, 3D U-Nets) and tasks, sometimes outperforming dense baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art results in electron microscopy image analysis using their evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: BB offers a simple and effective pruning mechanism that boosts efficiency and representation diversity, providing a promising path for improved model sparsity and performance.

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

*Runyu Lu,Shiqi He,Wenxuan Tan,Shenggui Li,Ruofan Wu,Jeff J. Ma,Ang Chen,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TetriServe, a system enhancing Diffusion Transformer (DiT) serving efficiency by dynamically adjusting parallelism based on request deadlines, achieving better GPU utilization and SLO attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serving high-quality image generation using DiT models under strict SLOs is challenging due to computational intensity and inefficiencies in handling mixed resolutions and deadlines.

Method: TetriServe uses step-level sequence parallelism, discretized time-round scheduling, adaptive parallelism, and joint request packing to efficiently fulfill image-generating tasks.

Result: TetriServe improves SLO attainment by up to 32% over existing systems while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: Step-level sequence parallelism and round-based scheduling significantly enhance SLO fulfillment and efficiency in DiT-based image generation systems.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: This paper extends the IsaacLab framework for scalable training of adversarial policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), featuring competitive environments and a reinforcement learning variant for asymmetric dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial interactions in MARL are critical for real-world applications like security, pursuit-evasion, and competitive manipulation, yet they are underexplored compared to collaborative settings.

Method: The authors developed adversarial MARL environments with heterogeneous agents, leveraging the HAPPO (Heterogeneous Agent Proximal Policy Optimization) method for efficient training in high-fidelity physics simulations.

Result: Experiments show the framework's ability to train robust policies for diverse multi-agent competition while preserving realism and throughput.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable, realistic simulation platform for adversarial MARL training and evaluation, along with publicly available code and benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these

*Ali Hatamizadeh,Syeda Nahida Akter,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Jan Kautz,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLP (Reinforcement Learning Pretraining), a new paradigm that incorporates reinforcement learning earlier in the training process of large reasoning models to improve chain-of-thought reasoning and overall task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current dominant training methods for reasoning models include reinforcement learning only at the post-training phase, which may limit exploration and improvement in reasoning. The paper seeks to analyze whether introducing reinforcement learning earlier during pretraining can lead to better reasoning abilities.

Method: RLP leverages a reinforcement-driven pretraining objective that treats reasoning chains as exploratory actions. Rewards measure the information gain in predicting future tokens using reasoning chains, creating a dense reward signal for efficient scalability across document streams.

Result: RLP pretraining significantly improves performance on math-science benchmarks and reasoning tasks. For example, using RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base improved benchmark scores by 19%, and applying RLP to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 showed a 23% increase in scientific reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLP demonstrates that incorporating reinforcement learning earlier in pretraining can enhance both exploration and reasoning capabilities, making it a scalable and effective training paradigm for diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

### [238] [Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269)
*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid control framework combining a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. The goal is to mitigate risks associated with RL training on physical structures, while eliminating dependency on accurate structural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of structural vibrations caused by external excitations, which pose significant safety and maintenance risks. Existing model-based approaches, like LQR, require tedious system identification. RL offers a model-free alternative but poses risks during training due to random control forces.

Method: A hybrid control framework is proposed, where an LQR controller derived from an incorrect random model guides the RL controller during its training phase. This ensures safety while keeping the solution model-free.

Result: The study confirms that an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model significantly reduces risks compared to an uncontrolled scenario. The hybrid framework effectively mitigates the dangers of naive RL implementations during training.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach ensures safe RL training without relying on explicit system models, addressing a critical challenge in model-free RL-based vibration control. This novel method minimizes exploration risks while demonstrating effective vibration mitigation.

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance the interpretability of RNNs by understanding their internal dynamics, which is crucial for improving their design and application.

Method: An information-theoretic method is proposed to identify key nodes (information relays) in RNNs by measuring the mutual information between input and output vectors.

Result: The study reveals distinct information relay patterns in architectures like LSTMs and GRUs. Node knockout experiments validate the functional importance of these nodes in network behavior.

Conclusion: The research enhances comprehension of information flow in RNNs and offers tools to design more interpretable and robust neural networks.

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NcPU, a novel PU learning method combining NoiSNCL and PLD, addressing challenges in representation learning under unreliable supervision to outperform current PU methods on complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the underperformance of state-of-the-art PU learning methods compared to supervised methods, especially on complex datasets, driven by unreliable supervision in learning representations.

Method: NcPU integrates a supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL) robust to noisy pairs, and phantom label disambiguation (PLD) for refining negative supervision via regret-based updates.

Result: NcPU achieves substantial performance improvements over existing PU methods on diverse challenging datasets, demonstrating both competitive accuracy and real-world application potential.

Conclusion: NcPU represents a promising advancement in PU learning, addressing reliability bottlenecks and achieving improved accuracy without relying on auxiliary information.

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method inspired by human microsaccades to detect misbehavior in large language models (LLMs) by applying position encoding perturbations, which indicate various failures without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research draws inspiration from microsaccades, involuntary eye movements that reveal hidden dynamics in human vision, to explore analogous mechanisms in LLMs for detecting their failures.

Method: The proposed method involves employing lightweight position encoding perturbations to elicit signals from LLMs, indicating potential misbehavior across various issues such as factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoor attacks.

Result: Experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs show that these perturbation-based probes successfully detect misbehaviors while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Pretrained LLMs already encode internal evidence to identify their own failures, and microsaccade-inspired interventions offer an effective approach to surface and address these undesired behaviors.

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

*Akshat Ramachandran,Marina Neseem,Charbel Sakr,Rangharajan Venkatesan,Brucek Khailany,Tushar Krishna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ThinKV, a framework to address GPU memory challenges of large model reasoning by compressing the key-value cache in an adaptive way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU memory quickly becomes a bottleneck during long-output context generation in large reasoning models due to the rapid growth of key-value caches.

Method: ThinKV employs a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy that prioritizes token precision based on their importance and recycles memory slots for evicted tokens using an extended PagedAttention kernel.

Result: ThinKV reduces KV cache usage to less than 5% of the original size with near-lossless accuracy and achieves up to 5.8x higher inference throughput.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that adaptive compression of KV caches can boost efficiency and performance in large reasoning models without significantly compromising accuracy.

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Xiaobo Ma,Hyunsoo Noh,James Tokishi,Ryan Hatch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a domain adaptation framework using Gradient Boosting with Balanced Weighting (GBBW) for accurate vehicle delay estimation across diverse intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential to address congestion, fuel consumption, emissions, and travel time reliability in traffic systems.

Method: The study involves separating traffic data into source and target domains, extracting key features, and fine-tuning the model using data weighting based on similarity between domains.

Result: The proposed GBBW model outperforms eight ML regression models and seven DA methods in estimating delays using data from 57 intersections.

Conclusion: The framework improves delay estimation and enables reliable traffic management and ML model transferability in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

*Rishi Sonthalia,Michael Murray,Guido Montúfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the low-rank structure in gradients of two-layer neural networks under relaxed assumptions on data and parameters, showing dominance by two rank-one terms and exploring their modulation by regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the gradient structure in two-layer neural networks without relying on typical isotropy assumptions and to explore how training data properties impact low-rank components and regularization effects.

Method: The study uses a spiked data model to analyze both mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. It examines gradient behavior theoretically and validates findings through experiments on synthetic and real data.

Result: The gradients are approximately low-rank, driven primarily by two rank-one terms related to bulk data-residue and spikes in input data. Regularizers like weight decay differentially affect these components.

Conclusion: Gradient structure in two-layer networks is dominated by predictable low-rank components, influenced by training data and regularization. This has implications for understanding neural network optimization and learning dynamics.

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and formalize the reasons why representations of actions from video data, within the LAPO framework, are effective and address unidentifiability challenges.

Method: The paper introduces formal desiderata for action representations, analyzes statistical implications, and proves the identifiability of an entropy-regularized LAPO learning objective.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the entropy-regularized LAPO objective function identifies action representations that meet the established desiderata, given certain conditions.

Conclusion: Discrete action representations in LAPO work effectively in practice due to the identifiable properties supported by the entropy-regularized framework.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

### [247] [Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335)
*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark (QuIIEst) for intrinsic dimension estimation (IDE) methods, based on quantum-inspired manifolds, and evaluates existing IDE methods on this challenging benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intrinsic dimension estimation methods often struggle to yield consistent results and lack evaluation on complex, topologically non-trivial manifolds.

Method: The authors propose the QuIIEst benchmark, which generates families of quantum-inspired manifolds with known intrinsic dimensions, and evaluate several IDE methods on these manifolds under strictly controlled conditions.

Result: The tested IDE methods showed lower accuracy on QuIIEst manifolds compared to existing benchmarks, and their performance remained robust even with increasingly non-uniform curvature.

Conclusion: QuIIEst provides a challenging and rigorous framework for evaluating the capabilities of IDE methods, highlighting shortcomings in current approaches and allowing for deeper exploration of intrinsic dimensionality, even for spaces that are not manifolds.

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

### [248] [To Augment or Not to Augment? Diagnosing Distributional Symmetry Breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01349)
*Hannah Lawrence,Elyssa Hofgard,Vasco Portilheiro,Yuxuan Chen,Tess Smidt,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a method to evaluate if symmetry-aware ML methods are effective by proposing a metric to measure symmetry-breaking in datasets. This is validated on synthetic and point cloud datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the assumption that symmetry-aware methods improve generalization and sample efficiency when transformed datapoints are highly probable under the test distribution.

Method: The paper proposes a metric to quantify anisotropy in a dataset using a two-sample neural classifier test, validated on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Result: The metric uncovers significant symmetry-breaking in point cloud datasets and demonstrates that symmetry-breaking can affect performance of invariant methods such as equivariant architectures.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware methods may not always work optimally depending on the dataset symmetry, suggesting the need to rethink symmetry biases in data.

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

### [249] [Self-Supervised Representation Learning as Mutual Information Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01345)
*Akhlaqur Rahman Sabby,Yi Sui,Tongzi Wu,Jesse C. Cresswell,Ga Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the principles behind self-supervised representation learning (SSRL), deriving two paradigms—Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI)—to explain architectural choices in SSRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical basis of SSRL methods and explain the design choices beyond empirical heuristics.

Method: A first-principles approach starting with a variational mutual information lower bound, leading to the derivation of the SDMI and JMI paradigms.

Result: SDMI necessitates alternating optimization and stop-gradient operations, while JMI supports joint optimization using symmetric architectures. Several SSRL methods fit into these paradigms as specific instances.

Conclusion: The paper unifies SSRL methods by providing a theoretical framework that explains architectural and operational choices, moving beyond heuristic experimentation.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

*Maedeh Saberi,Amir Barati Farimani,Safa Jamali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a machine learning model designed to efficiently learn complex fluid flow mechanics for predictive simulations, demonstrating high accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft material flow modeling is crucial for designing processes and materials with specific properties, but traditional methods face computational challenges and scalability issues.

Method: RheOFormer uses self-attention mechanisms in a generative operator learning framework to model fluid mechanics efficiently and accurately across diverse flow types and physical conditions.

Result: The model is benchmarked against various flow scenarios and demonstrates its ability to predict spatio-temporal dynamics of fluids with high accuracy, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: RheOFormer offers computational efficiency and strong generalization, making it suitable for accelerating simulations, experimentation, and optimization in fluid mechanics applications.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

### [251] [Selective Underfitting in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01378)
*Kiwhan Song,Jaeyeon Kim,Sitan Chen,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models selectively underfit the score function, crucial for understanding their generalization and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved question of which score function diffusion models truly learn and to understand the mechanism behind their ability to generate novel samples.

Method: The authors introduce 'selective underfitting,' characterize specific regions of input space where the score is accurately approximated, and design empirical interventions to test their hypothesis.

Result: Selective underfitting allows diffusion models to generalize and generate new samples, validating the refined perspective of score learning.

Conclusion: Selective underfitting is key for understanding and improving diffusion models' generative capabilities and generalization insights.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

*Jaeyeon Kim,Seunggeun Kim,Taekyun Lee,David Z. Pan,Hyeji Kim,Sham Kakade,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a lightweight, model-agnostic method enabling self-correction during inference in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), improving performance across various domains without major changes to the model or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited capacity of Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) for detecting and revising low-quality tokens during inference, considering that previous self-correction approaches were either architecture-heavy or relied on suboptimal token quality estimations.

Method: PRISM (Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions) proposes a self-correction loss to compute per-token quality scores during inference, detecting low-quality tokens in the same forward pass of MDM without requiring reinforcement learning or verifiers.

Result: PRISM enhances the inference quality of MDMs, demonstrating improved performance across domains such as Sudoku, unconditional text generation (with a 170M parameter model), and code generation using LLaDA (8B parameters).

Conclusion: PRISM provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for self-correction in pretrained Masked Diffusion Models, offering significant advancements in generative modeling without altering existing architectures or training processes.

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

TL;DR: The paper presents an inference-time optimization framework for language model generation, proposing an adaptive strategy to minimize computational costs while maintaining output quality. This approach outperforms traditional methods in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing high-quality generations with computational efficiency in large language model applications, particularly when using multiple generations.

Method: Develop a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm for deciding when to stop generating text without prior knowledge of reward distribution. Introduce adaptive scaling using a Bradley-Terry transformation to normalize rewards and determine stopping thresholds dynamically for LLM inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves similar quality to Best-of-N sampling while reducing the number of required generations by 15-35% on average in experiments using the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets.

Conclusion: The approach bridges optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing a theoretically grounded and practically efficient method to optimize large language model deployments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Motivation: To extend the capability of adversarially robust classifiers beyond 0-1 loss and investigate new mathematical connections such as $
 \alpha$-fair packing problems.

Method: Dual and barycentric reformulations of robust risk minimization problems, investigating connections to $
 \alpha$-fair packing and entropy penalties like Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis measures.

Result: Sharpened lower bound computations on adversarial risks, especially for the cross-entropy loss, along with illustrative experiments highlighting improved robustness efficiency.

Conclusion: The results enhance both the computational and theoretical foundation for designing robust multiclass classifiers under arbitrary loss functions, enabling stronger protection against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free energy reconstruction methods, like Gaussian Process Regression, are limited by the need for Jacobians of collective variables, especially for complex or machine-learned CVs.

Method: The authors propose a neural network surrogate that learns collective variables directly from Cartesian coordinates and leverages automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians.

Result: The framework demonstrated high accuracy in an MgCl2 ion-pairing system for both simple and complex CVs, with Jacobian errors following a Gaussian distribution.

Conclusion: This method enables gradient-based free energy techniques to integrate complex and machine-learned CVs, potentially transforming simulations in biochemistry and materials science.

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Mixture Flow Variational Inference (AMF-VI) combines multiple types of flow models, yielding robust variational inference across diverse posterior families, with better consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-flow VI models often struggle with inconsistent behavior across varying distributions, motivating the need for robust approaches that work well across diverse posterior families.

Method: The proposed AMF-VI applies a two-stage training process: (i) training individual flows sequentially as experts, and (ii) estimating global adaptive weights using likelihood-driven updates to create mixtures.

Result: AMF-VI outperforms single-flow baselines across six diverse posterior families, achieving lower negative log-likelihoods, improved transport metrics (e.g., Wasserstein-2), and reduced maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).

Conclusion: Adaptive mixtures of diverse flow models can improve robustness and consistency in variational inference, with minimal overhead and preservation of individual model's inductive biases.

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by high computational costs of convolution-based decoders in neural image compression.

Method: The authors integrate low-rank representation within an autoencoder architecture and leverage vector quantization. Computationally efficient low-rank operations are applied on the latent image representations for reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method achieves efficient image reconstruction with reduced computational cost in the decoding phase, effectively resolving the compute bottleneck.

Conclusion: The framework maintains high-fidelity image outputs while eliminating the computational overhead in neural compression reconstruction, potentially enabling broader adoption of neural compression methods across applications.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to bridge the gap between the predictive power of deep learning-based PPG analysis and the interpretability of its physiological features for clinical use and sensor design.

Method: The authors introduced PPGen, a biophysical model of PPG signals, and hybrid amortized inference (HAI) for scalable, robust extraction of physiological parameters and correction of model inaccuracies.

Result: The study demonstrated that HAI accurately inferred physiological parameters under various noise and sensor conditions in simulated experiments.

Conclusion: PPGen and HAI provide a framework for developing PPG models that balance deep learning fidelity with meaningful clinical insights and applicable hardware designs.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

### [260] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that ensures precise recall control with minimal variance for spatial conflation tasks, leveraging neural rankers, stratified calibration, and ensemble threshold estimations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for precise recall in large-scale spatial conflation and entity-matching tasks where missing true matches compromises analytics, and excessive manual review inflates costs. Existing tools lack precision and are inconsistent under skewed data.

Method: The framework involves geometry filtering, a sparse candidate representation, deterministic sampling, neural score ranking, score propagation, stratified calibration, and ensemble thresholding using multiple estimators and inverse-variance weighting.

Result: The approach achieves precise recall targets, reduces redundancy in manual verifications, and operates efficiently on large datasets using a single TPU core, with small errors in recall and low variance.

Conclusion: The method ensures exact recall with high efficiency and low computational cost, making it practical for large-scale tasks requiring stringent recall accuracy.

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

### [261] [SoftAdaClip: A Smooth Clipping Strategy for Fair and Private Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01447)
*Dorsa Soleymani,Ali Dadsetan,Frank Rudzicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip is a new differentially private training method using a smooth transformation to enhance utility and fairness, addressing the limitations of DP-SGD and Adaptive-DPSGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy methods like DP-SGD degrade model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups, due to uniform hard gradient clipping.

Method: SoftAdaClip introduces a tanh-based smooth transformation for gradient clipping to balance sensitivity and preserve relative gradient magnitudes in private model training.

Result: SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities in datasets by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, showing statistically significant fairness improvements.

Conclusion: Integrating smooth transformations like SoftAdaClip with adaptive mechanisms improves fairness and privacy in model training, making it viable for sensitive data handling.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

### [262] [Reinforcement Learning with Action-Triggered Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02149)
*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses reinforcement learning with stochastic state observations triggered by actions, defining a framework called Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs). It provides theoretical foundations and proposes an algorithm for efficient learning under observation constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore reinforcement learning in scenarios with action-triggered and sporadic state observations, a common constraint in real-world applications.

Method: The paper formulates ATST-MDPs, derives tailored Bellman equations, and introduces the action-sequence learning paradigm. Additionally, it develops ST-LSVI-UCB, an algorithm adapted for this setting, and provides theoretical regret bounds.

Result: The authors show that value functions possess linear representations under a linear MDP assumption. They also derive off-policy estimators with error guarantees and demonstrate that the proposed ST-LSVI-UCB algorithm achieves competitive regret bounds with a dependence on the number of episodes, feature dimension, and discount factor.

Conclusion: Efficient learning is achievable in systems with sporadic, action-triggered observations, contributing foundational insights for practical reinforcement learning frameworks under such constraints.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

*Yifei Zuo,Yutong Yin,Zhichen Zeng,Ang Li,Banghua Zhu,Zhaoran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Linear Attention (LLA), a new attention mechanism focused on improving expressiveness through theoretical insights despite increased computational costs. It addresses computational complexities and implements hardware-efficient solutions for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore more expressive attention mechanisms grounded in theoretical foundations, as opposed to focusing solely on computational efficiency.

Method: The authors derive LLA from test-time regression insights in nonparametric statistics, perform bias-variance trade-off analysis, address computational complexity using memory-efficient primitives, and implement FlashLLA – a hardware-efficient algorithm.

Result: Experimental outcomes show that LLA adapts well to non-stationary environments and outperforms existing baselines in tasks like test-time training, in-context learning, associative recall, and state tracking.

Conclusion: LLA proves itself as a scalable and theoretically grounded attention mechanism that holds promise for large-scale models, balancing expressiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

### [264] [Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02174)
*Stefano Bruno,Youngsik Hwang,Jaehyeon An,Sotirios Sabanis,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), a method for deep learning optimization that seeks flat minima to improve generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the need to effectively find flat minima in nonconvex optimization problems, as classical SGLD lacks the mechanism to prioritize low-curvature solutions.

Method: fSGLD utilizes isotropic Gaussian noise (Random Weight Perturbation) at each iteration to optimize a stochastic smoothing objective that captures curvature information. The approach is theoretically grounded to ensure convergence to flatter minima.

Result: Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks demonstrated that fSGLD ensures superior or comparable generalization and robustness, maintaining SGD's computational cost, and significantly outperforming baselines in flatness of minima.

Conclusion: fSGLD combines theoretical insights and practical performance enhancements, offering a computationally efficient way to achieve flat minima, improving generalization and robustness in deep learning optimization tasks.

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

*Brett Barkley,Preston Culbertson,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOPED proposes a fast and effective method for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection using a single diffusion model, reducing computational costs significantly compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable deployment of machine learning systems across various domains necessitates robust OOD detection capabilities.

Method: SCOPED leverages a trained diffusion model, combining Jacobian trace and squared norm of the score function into a test statistic. It employs kernel density estimation for flexible thresholding and utilizes Hutchinson's trace estimator for computational efficiency.

Result: SCOPED achieves state-of-the-art precision-recall scores on vision benchmarks and effectively generalizes to robotic control tasks, demonstrating robust OOD detection across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: SCOPED represents a practical, efficient, and versatile solution for OOD detection, making it valuable for applications in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and dataset curation.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

### [266] [Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216)
*Zeqi Ye,Minshuo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the statistical efficiency and uncertainty quantification of conditional diffusion transformers for time-series imputation and introduces a mixed-masking training strategy for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data often contain missing values, which compromise data quality. While diffusion-based methods excel empirically in imputation tasks, their theoretical understanding—specifically capturing spatial and temporal dependencies—remains underexplored.

Method: The authors derive statistical sample complexity bounds using a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions with transformers. They quantify uncertainty via confidence regions and validate theoretical insights through simulation. Additionally, they propose a mixed-masking training strategy.

Result: The study shows that missing value patterns significantly affect the efficiency and accuracy of imputation. Tight confidence regions for missing values are constructed, and the mixed-masking strategy improves performance.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based models offer statistically efficient and promising solutions for time-series imputation. Incorporating understanding of missing patterns and training strategies enhances their practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

### [267] [Fixing That Free Lunch: When, Where, and Why Synthetic Data Fails in Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01457)
*Brett Barkley,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates synthetic data in model-based reinforcement learning and the failure modes limiting its potential. It proposes solutions to these issues, enabling performance improvements in previously failing contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand why synthetic data sometimes fails in model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, addressing challenges and environmental dependencies that hinder their effectiveness.

Method: The authors analyze model-based policy optimization (MBPO) in varying environments, identify critical failure modes, and propose adjustments to address scale mismatches and improve target representation.

Result: By resolving failure modes in MBPO, the proposed adjustments allowed it to outperform model-free Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in 5 out of 7 tasks in a challenging environment, while retaining its prior strengths.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of environment-specific benchmarks, proposes improved algorithm designs, and calls for research in taxonomies that clarify connections between task structures and algorithmic performance.

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

*Ethan Baron,Boris Oreshkin,Ruijun Ma,Hanyu Zhang,Kari Torkkola,Michael W. Mahoney,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Tatiana Konstantinova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a copula-based method to efficiently generate multi-step correlated forecast paths for time series data, addressing expensive autoregressive sampling and snowballing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-step time series models struggle with generating realistic correlation structures in forecast trajectories efficiently, leading to heavy computational costs and error accumulation.

Method: The authors introduce a copula-based approach to directly generate correlated sample paths in one forward pass, enhancing existing multi-step time series models.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms autoregressive sampling in efficiency (orders of magnitude speed improvement) and sample path quality, reducing snowballing errors.

Conclusion: This copula-based framework offers a faster, more accurate alternative for producing correlated forecasts in time series applications, advancing the field's capacity for better predictions.

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

### [269] [How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458)
*Shawn Im,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how noisy human feedback affects preference optimization in large language models (LLMs), providing insights and guarantees for training under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more advanced, aligning these models with human preferences is essential. Human feedback, however, often contains errors and inconsistencies, which challenges existing noise-free assumptions in preference optimization.

Method: The paper explores the impact of noisy feedback through generalization guarantees and focuses on finite-step optimization, introducing analyses for different noise types, noise rates, and preference data distributions.

Result: The analysis shows how generalization in preference optimization decays under various noisy feedback conditions. Empirical tests on LLMs validate the findings, applying to preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, and SLiC.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to account for noisy feedback in LLM alignment, offering practical insights to improve AI systems' preference optimization processes.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

*Kaja Gruntkowska,Yassine Maziane,Zheng Qu,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces "Drop-Muon," a training framework that updates only a subset of layers per step rather than all layers, resulting in faster and more efficient deep learning model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the common assumption in deep learning that all layers must be updated at every step, arguing that this approach could be suboptimal.

Method: The method, called Drop-Muon, employs a randomized schedule to update only subsets of layers at each step using non-Euclidean updates. It merges aspects of progressive training with layer-specific updates.

Result: Drop-Muon achieves faster training (up to 1.4x speedup) while maintaining the same accuracy compared to full-network updates using the Muon optimizer, with theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Conclusion: The findings propose a paradigm shift in training large-scale models, advocating for the efficiency and practicality of selective layer updates instead of full-network updates.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LSPO, a meta-RLVR algorithm, to dynamically select training data based on response length, aiming to improve reinforcement learning efficiency for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by studies on overthinking in LLMs and aims to enhance training efficiency using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: The authors propose LSPO, which adapts training data selection dynamically by utilizing average response length during reinforcement learning.

Result: LSPO demonstrated consistent improvements in learning effectiveness when tested across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: LSPO effectively integrates response length into dynamic sampling, enhancing RLVR in LLM training and opening avenues for further research on length-aware signals.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS), a novel method for posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion models, addressing existing challenges and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve posterior sampling in applications like inverse problems and stylization using pretrained discrete diffusion models without retraining task-specific systems.

Method: The paper introduces APS, leveraging two key innovations: quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding in discrete diffusion models.

Result: APS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in linear and nonlinear inverse problems, and showcases its utility in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.

Conclusion: APS effectively addresses limitations of existing discrete diffusion sampling methods, making it a powerful tool for principled Bayesian inference and diverse applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Motivation: The inconsistency in offline-to-online RL methods motivates the need for a systematic understanding to determine appropriate design choices for online fine-tuning.

Method: The authors develop a stability-plasticity framework, categorizing fine-tuning into three regimes based on preserving pretrained policy versus offline dataset knowledge and validate its predictions through large-scale empirical studies.

Result: Empirical validation shows that the stability-plasticity framework aligns with predictions in 45 out of 63 cases, offering insights into design choices for RL methods.

Conclusion: The stability-plasticity principle provides a structured understanding to improve the effectiveness and reliability of offline-to-online reinforcement learning paradigms.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

### [274] [Diffusion Models and the Manifold Hypothesis: Log-Domain Smoothing is Geometry Adaptive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02305)
*Tyler Farghly,Peter Potaptchik,Samuel Howard,George Deligiannidis,Jakiw Pidstrigach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the mechanisms behind diffusion models' performance, investigating the role of implicit regularization and data manifold geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand why diffusion models exhibit strong generalization across diverse domains, focusing on their adaptation to low-dimensional data manifold structure.

Method: The authors use theoretical and empirical analyses to study the behavior of smoothing minimizers of the score matching objective, examining its impact on the data manifold.

Result: The study finds that smoothing the score function leads to tangential smoothing on the data manifold, and that the diffusion model's generalization can be controlled via chosen smoothing techniques.

Conclusion: The results confirm the conjecture that the success of diffusion models is linked to their ability to align with data manifold geometry, highlighting the role of smoothing in enhancing their generalization properties.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

### [275] [Fine-tuning LLMs with variational Bayesian last layer for high-dimensional Bayesian optimzation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01471)
*Haotian Xiang,Jinwen Xu,Qin Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian optimization method called ENS-LoRA-VBLL, which uses low-rank adaptation and variational Bayesian approaches to efficiently optimize black-box problems with high-dimensional, irregular variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve optimization techniques for high-dimensional black-box problems with expensive evaluation costs, where traditional Gaussian processes fall short.

Method: The paper uses large language models (LLMs) as surrogates and fine-tunes their performance with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL). A weighted ensemble approach (ENS) is devised to optimize hyperparameters and continually update parameters.

Result: The ENS-LoRA-VBLL framework demonstrates strong performance on various high-dimensional benchmarks and real-world molecular optimization tasks, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows promise in handling complex optimization settings efficiently, suggesting its utility in challenging high-dimensional black-box problems.

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS improves efficiency in HW-NAS by reducing search cost and latency, leveraging an LLM-driven approach with a partitioned search space and co-evolutionary prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supernet-based HW-NAS methods are computationally expensive and suffer from exploration bias when using LLM-driven approaches.

Method: PEL-NAS introduces a partitioned search space, co-evolutionary architecture prompts powered by an LLM, and zero-cost predictors to enhance search efficiency and accuracy.

Result: PEL-NAS achieves higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency while reducing search costs from GPU days to minutes.

Conclusion: PEL-NAS addresses exploration bias and computational inefficiency in HW-NAS, enabling faster and more diverse architectural search with improved performance metrics.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

*Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust imitation learning method, Density-Ratio Weighted BC, effectively prioritizes clean data to optimize policies in contaminated offline RL datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with degraded performance when datasets are contaminated by adversarial attacks or errors. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing policies from such corrupted datasets.

Method: The authors propose Density-Ratio Weighted BC, which uses a small clean reference set to estimate density ratios via a binary discriminator, reweighting corrupted data to prioritize expert behaviors.

Result: Weighted BC achieves near-optimal performance despite high contamination rates, outperforming existing methods like traditional BC, BCQ, and BRAC in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The method is an effective and theoretically sound approach for improving policy optimization under dataset contamination, making it a robust alternative for safety-critical offline RL applications.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

### [278] [Understanding Adversarial Transfer: Why Representation-Space Attacks Fail Where Data-Space Attacks Succeed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01494)
*Isha Gupta,Rylan Schaeffer,Joshua Kazdan,Ken Liu,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper distinguishes between transferability of attacks on machine learning models in data-space and representation-space, providing theoretical and experimental evidence that only data-space attacks transfer effectively between models unless the geometry of representations is aligned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why certain adversarial attacks, such as text jailbreaks or image adversarial examples, successfully transfer between models while others, like attacks on vision-language models, fail to transfer.

Method: The authors provided theoretical proofs and conducted four experimental setups: 1) simple mathematical constructs, 2) representation-space attacks on image classifiers, 3) representation-space attacks on language models, and 4) data-space and transformed representation-space attacks on vision-language models.

Result: The study found that data-space attacks transfer reliably across models, whereas representation-space attacks require geometric alignment of model representations to transfer.

Conclusion: Adversarial transfer depends on whether attacks occur in data-space or model-specific representation spaces, highlighting the need to consider this when developing robust models.

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

### [279] [Beyond Majority Voting: LLM Aggregation by Leveraging Higher-Order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01499)
*Rui Ai,Yuqi Pan,David Simchi-Levi,Milind Tambe,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Majority voting in multi-agent large language models (LLMs) is suboptimal due to not addressing model correlations. The study introduces better aggregation methods for accurate collective decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current majority voting methods overlook the heterogeneity and correlation among different LLMs, demanding improved aggregation techniques.

Method: The study introduces two aggregation methods, Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), which leverage first-order and second-order information to enhance collective decision-making.

Result: Empirical validations across synthetic data, popular benchmarks, and real-world healthcare settings show OW and ISP outperform majority voting consistently.

Conclusion: OW and ISP provide improved aggregation methods that address the limitations of majority voting, ensuring reliable decisions in multi-agent LLM settings.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

*Will Y. Zou,Jean Feng,Alexandre Kalimouttou,Jennifer Yuntong Zhang,Christopher W. Seymour,Romain Pirracchio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for optimal drug dosing in ICU patients with septic shock, incorporating interpretable action space designs and achieving over 15% improvement in survival probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skepticism exists among practitioners regarding reinforcement learning's applicability in clinical decision support systems, particularly for dosing decisions.

Method: The paper uses offline conservative Q-learning with recurrent modeling within a replay buffer, combined with action space design that supports discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate improved patient outcomes with more than 15% survival probability enhancement and better alignment with clinical protocols.

Conclusion: Action space design enhances interpretability and clinical adoption of reinforcement learning methods while maintaining efficacy in ICU drug dosing scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

### [281] [Flock: A Knowledge Graph Foundation Model via Learning on Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01510)
*Jinwoo Kim,Xingyue Huang,Krzysztof Olejniczak,Kyungbin Min,Michael Bronstein,Seunghoon Hong,İsmail İlkan Ceylan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flock, a novel knowledge graph foundation model that employs probabilistic node-relation equivariance to improve zero-shot link prediction in knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of conventional deterministic equivariance in knowledge graph foundation models, which restricts their capability to distinguish structurally similar but semantically different relations, especially in zero-shot link prediction settings.

Method: The proposed model, Flock, employs probabilistic node-relation equivariance by introducing controlled randomization through sampling random walks, recording them as sequences, embedding them with a sequence model, and aggregating representations using learned pooling techniques.

Result: Flock outperforms existing knowledge graph foundation models by solving the newly designed Petals dataset perfectly and achieving state-of-the-art performance on 54 knowledge graphs across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic node-relation equivariance concept expands the expressive power of knowledge graph models, making Flock an effective solution for more generalizable and precise zero-shot link prediction in diverse knowledge graph settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

*Hossein Sholehrasa,Xuan Xu,Doina Caragea,Jim E. Riviere,Majid Jaberi-Douraki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops an AI-powered predictive framework using FDA data to classify fatal versus recovery outcomes in food-producing animals, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and regulation of pharmaceutical use in food-producing animals by identifying adverse events that could lead to residues affecting human food safety.

Method: A data preprocessing pipeline was created to integrate and normalize data, and supervised models (e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer) were trained and optimized using ensemble techniques and pseudo-labeling, focusing on imbalanced class handling.

Result: The CatBoost and ensemble methods achieved an F1-score of 0.95. Pseudo-labeling improved predictions for minority cases, and SHAP analysis revealed biologically relevant predictors.

Conclusion: This framework combines advanced ML and explainable AI to predict veterinary safety outcomes accurately, aiding regulatory bodies in residue risk assessments and improving food safety.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

*Diptyaroop Maji,Kang Yang,Prashant Shenoy,Ramesh K Sitaraman,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CarbonX, a tool applying Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to forecast and impute carbon intensity data across diverse grids with high accuracy, regardless of grid-specific data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing carbon intensity forecasting tools face limitations such as dependence on grid-specific data, difficulty in achieving global coverage, and lack of uncertainty estimates, which hinder their utility in decarbonization efforts.

Method: The authors developed CarbonX, an open-source tool leveraging TSFMs. It requires only historical carbon intensity data to provide zero-shot and fine-tuned forecasts for various grids. The tool also includes prediction intervals and robust imputation capabilities.

Result: CarbonX achieved a zero-shot MAPE of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. On 13 benchmark grids, it matched state-of-the-art methods with an average MAPE of 9.59%, provided 95% prediction interval coverage, and exhibited minimal degradation over 21 days. Fine-tuned models outperformed statistical baselines by 1.2 to 3.9 times on data imputation tasks.

Conclusion: CarbonX demonstrated strong, reliable, and flexible performance for decarbonization tasks across diverse global grids, making it a practical tool even in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

*Woojin Kim,James R. Luedtke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in verifying binarized neural networks (BNNs) by optimizing integer programming (IP) formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNN classification is sensitive to input perturbations, necessitating verification for robustness.

Method: Authors propose enhancing IP-based verification of BNNs using improved linear objectives for multi-class problems and generating valid inequalities exploiting neural network structure.

Result: Techniques demonstrated better verification performance under input perturbations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The methods improve BNN verification efficiency and expand robustness evaluation possibilities.

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

### [285] [Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545)
*Haoyuan Cai,Zhenghao Peng,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive Preference Learning (PPL) introduces a method to propagate human interventions into future steps to improve agent learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in interactive imitation learning where agent's actions in future states are not adjusted, despite such states being potentially hazardous.

Method: PPL extends human interventions into a preference horizon of L future time steps and optimizes preferences in these predicted states to propagate corrections into safety-critical areas.

Result: Experiments on autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks showed improved efficiency and reduced need for human demonstrations, as well as general applicability.

Conclusion: PPL balances risky state coverage with label correctness, improving safety and reducing human effort in interactive imitation learning.

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

### [286] [Round-trip Reinforcement Learning: Self-Consistent Training for Better Chemical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01527)
*Lecheng Kong,Xiyuan Wang,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), which trains chemical language models to improve their round-trip consistency and overall task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical LLMs often lack the ability to maintain round-trip consistency, which impacts their flexibility and reliability in tasks such as molecule captioning and structure reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), where round-trip transformation success is used as a reward signal. An iterative self-improvement loop is introduced to enhance bidirectional mappings using unlabeled data efficiently.

Result: RTRL significantly improves both the performance and round-trip consistency of chemical LLMs in diverse data regimes.

Conclusion: The work establishes round-trip consistency as a trainable objective and a key pathway to creating robust and reliable foundation models in computational chemistry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

Method: A new attack method is presented that encodes a jailbreak prompt to bypass lightweight guards while maintaining high-quality responses. It exploits resource asymmetry between these guards and the main LLM.

Result: The attack successfully bypassed highly guarded chat interfaces of several prominent LLMs, revealing the inherent weaknesses of lightweight prompt guards in modern architectures.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to shift defense strategies from preventing malicious inputs to focusing on preventing malicious outputs and identifies several additional alignment challenges.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

*Kobi Cohen-Arazi,Michael Roe,Zhen Hu,Rohan Chavan,Anna Ptasznik,Joanna Lin,Joao Morais,Joseph Boccuzzi,Tommaso Balercia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to integrate Python-based AI/ML algorithms into GPU systems to optimize AI-native 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient integration of AI/ML models in next-generation 6G systems to enable AI-native wireless networks.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that converts Python-based algorithms into high-performing, GPU-runnable modules that work on NVIDIA GPUs, tested through channel estimation in PUSCH receivers using a CNN trained in Python.

Result: Demonstrated successful implementation of the framework on NVIDIA AI Aerial platform through a digital twin and real-time testbed for channel estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework supports scalable AI/ML integration into 6G systems, making AI-native networks feasible and efficient.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

*Haokun Zhao,Xiang Zhang,Jiaqi Wei,Yiwei Xu,Yuting He,Siqi Sun,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), an LLM-driven framework for general, domain-agnostic time series forecasting, outperforming traditional and LLM-based methods while simplifying the workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in time series forecasting, including the cost and labor-intensive processes like preprocessing, validation, and ensembling, and the poor generalization of existing methods across domains.

Method: The framework includes four specialized agents: Curator (diagnostics and preprocessing), Planner (model selection via self-planning), Forecaster (adaptive model fitting, validation, and ensembling), and Reporter (synthesizes workflow into an interpretable report).

Result: TSci demonstrates superior empirical performance on eight benchmarks, reducing forecast error by 10.4% compared to statistical methods and 38.2% compared to LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: TSci offers a domain-agnostic, interpretable, and extensible solution for time series forecasting, simplifying workflows and delivering more accurate predictions with transparent reporting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

### [290] [Executable Counterfactuals: Improving LLMs' Causal Reasoning Through Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539)
*Aniket Vashishtha,Qirun Dai,Hongyuan Mei,Amit Sharma,Chenhao Tan,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces executable counterfactuals, a framework for enhancing and evaluating counterfactual reasoning in language models (LLMs), incorporating abduction, intervention, and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing evaluations of LLM's counterfactual reasoning, which skip the essential abduction step, and improve performance in high-stakes applications.

Method: The authors designed a framework operationalizing counterfactual reasoning via code and math problems, and analyzed two training approaches: supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: State-of-the-art models experienced a substantial accuracy drop (25-40%) in counterfactual reasoning compared to interventional reasoning. RL training showed better generalization and performance improvements on novel tasks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows promise in enhancing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities across domains, outperforming alternative methods like supervised finetuning.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

### [291] [MIRA: Towards Mitigating Reward Hacking in Inference-Time Alignment of T2I Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)
*Kevin Zhai,Utsav Singh,Anirudh Thatipelli,Souradip Chakraborty,Anit Kumar Sahu,Furong Huang,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRA, a method to improve reward-based alignment of diffusion models during inference, effectively mitigating reward hacking by stabilizing output adherence to prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the issue of reward hacking in image generation by diffusion models, where high-reward images deviate from text prompts, without requiring computationally intensive fine-tuning.

Method: MIRA employs an image-space score-based regularization technique using a frozen backbone for inference-time alignment. It utilizes a KL surrogate to preserve distribution adherence and introduces MIRA-DPO for non-differentiable rewards.

Result: MIRA demonstrates over 60% win rate in multiple tests across models, rewards, and datasets, and achieves reward gains with minimal prompt drift. Baseline methods showed higher drift under increased compute.

Conclusion: MIRA offers a training-free solution for effectively aligning diffusion models with user-specific scalar rewards during inference, while maintaining fidelity to original prompts and improving overall reward metrics.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

*Kezhao Liu,Jason Klein Liu,Mingtao Chen,Yiming Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes different implementations of KL regularization in the context of RLHF, unifying them into one framework and showing which are theoretically sound and which introduce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While KL divergence loss is widely used in RLHF to stabilize training, there are multiple implementation styles, some of which might not be optimal. The paper seeks to understand the theoretical implications of these designs and their practical effects.

Method: The authors introduce a unified framework connecting distinct implementation styles of KL divergence in RLHF: treating a term as a reward coefficient or directly as a loss. They mathematically analyze these methods under on-policy and off-policy conditions.

Result: The paper proves that certain on-policy implementations ('k_1 in reward' and 'k_2 as loss') are theoretically equivalent and principled for optimizing reverse KL regularization, while others like 'k_3 as loss' and some off-policy methods introduce biases.

Conclusion: The study offers a gradient-based rationale for the correct implementation of KL regularization in RLHF, proposing corrections for biased methods and aiming to improve the robustness and effectiveness of reinforcement learning systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

*Seong Woo Han,Daniel Duy Vo,Brielin C. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Bayesian method, Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), for identifying causal relationships using interventional data. It offers improved performance and integrates uncertainty-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of poor performance and lack of uncertainty quantification in current methods for causal discovery in large-scale tasks using interventional data.

Method: The authors develop IBCD, which uses an empirical Bayesian framework. It models the likelihood of total causal effects with a matrix normal distribution and employs a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior for edge detection, enabling uncertainty-aware inferences.

Result: IBCD demonstrates superior structure recovery in simulations and successfully applies to CRISPR Perturb-seq data on 521 genes, showcasing its ability to generate robust graph structures.

Conclusion: IBCD advances causal discovery methods by improving structure recovery, integrating uncertainty quantification, and handling large-scale interventional data effectively.

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) with protein language models (PLMs) for protein design in four areas, showing that RL improves success rates and sampling efficiency under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reinforcement learning can advance the capabilities of protein language models beyond their pretrained priors and uncover latent rules for sequence-structure-function relationships.

Method: The study pairs RL with PLMs across four protein design tasks, evaluating diverse RL algorithms and model classes while analyzing their impact on sampling efficiency and capability improvements beyond supervised learning.

Result: Across benchmarks, RL consistently enhances success rates and sample efficiency. Key factors influencing gains are task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity, with improvements scaling when conditions are favorable.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can effectively complement PLMs in protein design, provided reward modeling and policy capacity are prioritized. The approach offers practical guidelines for task-specific optimization and is publicly implemented online.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPAMP, a new framework to enhance gradient clipping and modulation for deep network training, achieving improved stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of rigid and static gradient clipping mechanisms that ignore gradient distribution dynamics and their impact on deep network training.

Method: SPAMP framework leverages per-layer gradient statistics, dynamic threshold estimation, and power-based transformations to enhance gradient modulation in a smooth and adaptive manner.

Result: Experiments on image and language tasks show marked improvements in training stability, convergence, and robustness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: SPAMP provides a flexible and statistically-informed approach to gradient modulation, outperforming existing methods and offering new ways of controlling training updates.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

*Joykirat Singh,Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Akshay Nambi,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRAAC is an RL method that adjusts reasoning length based on task difficulty and compresses redundant reasoning steps, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models often struggle with appropriately sizing reasoning steps, leading to errors in complex tasks or inefficiencies in simple ones. The paper aims to address this under-adaptivity issue.

Method: The authors introduce TRAAC, a post-training RL approach that applies self-attention for identifying and pruning unnecessary reasoning steps and estimates task difficulty to better allocate computation resources.

Result: TRAAC improves task accuracy by 8.4% and reduces reasoning length by 36.8% compared to the base model, and also outperforms RL baselines with a 7.9% accuracy boost and 29.4% reasoning length reduction.

Conclusion: TRAAC enables adaptive thinking by allocating reasoning budgets based on task complexity and leveraging attention-based compression, showing generalization across math and non-math datasets.

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoRo, a framework to enhance noise robustness in UPDRS prediction for Parkinson's disease telemonitoring by training on augmented features with a customizable noise injection module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in Parkinson's disease telemonitoring caused by three types of noise—patient-induced inaccuracies, environmental noise, and data packet loss—that lead to higher prediction errors.

Method: The proposed method, NoRo, groups speech features into ordered bins to create contrastive pairs, trains a multilayer perceptron encoder for noise-robust feature generation, and augments these features with the original ones for UPDRS prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments show that NoRo successfully improves noise robustness for UPDRS predictions across various models and in different noisy environments.

Conclusion: NoRo is shown to effectively reduce noise-related prediction errors in telemonitoring Parkinson's disease, making it a promising solution for enhancing telehealth applications.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) for true random number generation in generative AI systems, addressing security vulnerabilities in traditional pseudo-RNGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle security vulnerabilities in deterministic pseudo-random number generators used in generative AI models, which are susceptible to exploitation by attackers.

Method: The authors propose embedding hardware-generated true random bits from STT-MTJs into generative AI systems and evaluate their approach with an FPGA-assisted prototype delivering high throughput and low latency.

Result: Integrating STT-MTJ-based true random bits into a GAN model significantly reduced insecure outputs by up to 18.6 times compared to RNG baselines, passing NIST randomness tests with minimal performance overhead.

Conclusion: The STT-MTJ-based RNG system demonstrates potential for scalable, efficient, and secure application in large AI models, marking a step toward practical security components in next-generation generative AI systems.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

*Zhen Li,Fan Zhang,Zheng Zhang,Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates 'posterior collapse' in variational autoencoders (VAEs), presenting it as a phase transition influenced by data structures and model hyper-parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim was to understand posterior collapse in VAEs beyond an optimization failure and provide insights into its causes and implications.

Method: Authors leveraged concepts from statistical physics to identify a critical hyper-parameter threshold and analyzed the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and prior.

Result: Validation confirms the presence of a phase transition in posterior collapse using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Posterior collapse is not strictly an optimization issue but rather a phase transition tied to data and model dynamics, impacting trainability and functional capacity of generative models.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the relationship between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) performance and reinforcement learning (RL) performance, revealing cases where high SFT scores don't translate to improved RL outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if high supervised fine-tuning (SFT) scores on reasoning tasks reliably lead to better performance after reinforcement learning (RL) and improve scalable post-training effectiveness.

Method: The authors trained hundreds of models (up to 12 billion parameters) using SFT and RL with verified rewards on extensive benchmarks. They examined correlations between various metrics, like generalization loss, and RL performance.

Result: The results show that SFT scores are not reliable predictors of RL performance. Alternative metrics like generalization loss and Pass@large k significantly improve prediction accuracy for RL outcomes.

Conclusion: High SFT scores can sometimes harm RL performance in certain settings. Generalization-focused metrics better predict RL success, and this insight can improve training and evaluation processes for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data can accelerate LLM pre-training under certain conditions, with mixed evidence regarding its broader effectiveness and impact on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether synthetic data can alleviate the scarcity of high-quality training data critical for LLM scaling.

Method: Over 1,000 LLMs were trained using 100,000+ GPU hours to compare natural web data, various types of synthetic data, and their mixtures under a unified protocol and scaling laws.

Result: Mixtures of synthetic and natural data (e.g., 1/3 rephrased synthetic data) speed up training by 5-10x for large data budgets, while training solely on synthetic data shows trade-offs depending on text type and data budgets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data has conditional benefits; its optimal use depends on factors like model size, data budget, and the synthetic data composition. The study offers practical guidance and mixed evidence on potential 'model collapse.'

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [302] [CAT: Curvature-Adaptive Transformers for Geometry-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01634)
*Ryan Y. Lin,Siddhartha Ojha,Nicholas Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT) introduces a mechanism to dynamically route data across different geometric spaces, improving relational reasoning compared to fixed-geometry architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers assume Euclidean geometry, which limits their performance on data with hierarchical or cyclical non-Euclidean structures. Current solutions require committing to one geometry, reducing flexibility when mixed geometric properties exist.

Method: CAT dynamically learns per-token routing using three geometric attention branches across Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces via a differentiable gating mechanism. This enables adaptive geometric specialization based on relational structure.

Result: On knowledge graph benchmarks FB15k-237 and WN18RR, CAT improves metrics (MRR and Hits@10) by approximately 10% compared to fixed-geometry baselines with negligible overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time).

Conclusion: Adaptive geometric learning outperforms fixed geometries in relational reasoning tasks, providing scalability and interpretability for mixed-geometry data across various domains.

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

### [303] [Detecting Post-generation Edits to Watermarked LLM Outputs via Combinatorial Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01637)
*Liyan Xie,Muhammad Siddeek,Mohamed Seif,Andrea J. Goldsmith,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a watermarking framework for large language models (LLMs) to detect and localize post-generation edits in AI-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary LLM-generated text often undergoes post-generation modifications (e.g., human revisions or spoofing), necessitating methods to identify and localize such edits, especially for distinguishing these texts from human-written outputs.

Method: The authors devised a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework that partitions vocabularies into subsets, embeds watermarks through deterministic patterns, and introduces global and local statistical methods to detect and locate edits.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong empirical performance in detecting and localizing edits during evaluation on open-source LLMs and across various editing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed watermarking framework effectively addresses the challenge of identifying and localizing post-generation edits in watermarked LLM-generated content, introducing a novel solution to a key challenge in this domain.

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

*Maryam Aliakbarpour,Vladimir Braverman,Junze Yin,Haochen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework called support-basis decomposition for efficient attention approximation, overcoming the limitations of bounded-entry assumptions in softmax attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention in large language models limits scalability, and current solutions are ineffective due to restrictive assumptions.

Method: The paper proposes support-basis decomposition, splitting entries of query and key matrices into sparse and dense components, enabling exact computation for sparse parts and polynomial approximation for dense parts.

Result: Sub-quadratic runtime is achieved with theoretical guarantees and a multi-threshold setting that removes distributional assumptions. It also justifies the empirical success of polynomial attention via sketching techniques.

Conclusion: Support-basis decomposition addresses the bottleneck in softmax attention, providing a practical and theoretically sound solution for accelerating large language models.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

*Muhammad Tanzil Furqon,Mahardhika Pratama,Igor Škrjanc,Lin Liu,Habibullah Habibullah,Kutluyil Dogancay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents REFEREE, a source-free cross-domain continual learning approach that utilizes dynamic prompt collaborations and frequency-aware techniques, eliminating the use of labeled source-domain samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require fully labeled source domains, which are impractical in privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Method: REFEREE leverages a combination of source pre-trained models and vision-language models. It applies frequency-aware prompting for domain shifts and addresses noisy pseudo labels through uncertainty-aware weighting and KLDA against catastrophic forgetting.

Result: REFEREE outperforms prior methods, including those with access to source domain samples, achieving significant margins.

Conclusion: This novel method successfully tackles source-free cross-domain continual learning challenges, showcasing robustness and effectiveness in privacy-constrained environments.

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

*Kwanhee Lee,Hyeondo Jang,Dongyeop Lee,Dan Alistarh,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Elsa, a neural network pruning method surpassing prior sparsity limitations by achieving up to 90% sparsity while maintaining high language model fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of current neural network pruning methods, which degrade model accuracy at moderate sparsity levels.

Method: Elsa uses constrained optimization techniques based on ADMM to address limitations linked to surrogate objective formulations in conventional pruning approaches.

Result: Elsa demonstrates superior performance, achieving up to 7.8× less perplexity at 90% sparsity compared to existing methods, and supports scaling through its quantized variant.

Conclusion: The work highlights a significant advancement in large language model sparsity, with potential for future exploration in under-investigated directions.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

*Jiashun Liu,Johan Obando-Ceron,Han Lu,Yancheng He,Weixun Wang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng,Pablo Samuel Castro,Aaron Courville,Ling Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a scalable RL framework for large language models that effectively restores critics' functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methods for large language models often avoid explicit critics due to computational costs and failure under sparse rewards or long reasoning horizons. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: AsyPPO introduces lightweight, mini-critics trained on disjoint prompt shards to improve value estimation and policy updates, incorporating strategies to mask advantages and filter high-divergence states.

Result: With only 5,000 training samples, AsyPPO achieves learning stability and performance gains over baselines like GRPO and classic PPO, improving benchmarks by up to six percent.

Conclusion: Architectural innovations, such as the use of mini-critics, are crucial for developing efficient and scalable RL methods for large language models.

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

*Amin Jalali,Milad Soltany,Michael Greenspan,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeHUT, a method for learning time-series representations focused on balancing uniformity and tolerance in embedding spaces through novel contrastive learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning robust time-series representations, particularly balancing uniformity and tolerance to improve coherence of embeddings while enhancing temporal dependency capture.

Method: TimeHUT employs a hierarchical framework integrating a temperature scheduler and hierarchical angular margin loss to adaptively balance uniformity and tolerance, and enforce geometric margins between positive and negative temporal sequence pairs.

Result: TimeHUT significantly outperforms existing methods in univariate and multivariate classification across 158 datasets and achieves competitive results in anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: TimeHUT establishes itself as an effective method for robust time-series representation learning, with its novel mechanisms demonstrating enhanced classification and anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShapKAN, a pruning framework for Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) which uses Shapley value-based attribution to evaluate node importance consistently, addressing the challenges in pruning KANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks, while effective in prediction, are limited in interpretability. KANs improve interpretability with spline-based activations but face challenges in pruning due to sensitivity to input coordinate shifts.

Method: The proposed ShapKAN framework employs Shapley value attribution to measure node importance in a shift-invariant manner, unlike traditional magnitude-based pruning methods.

Result: ShapKAN preserves accurate node importance rankings, enables effective pruning, and achieves network compression while maintaining KAN’s symbolic representation recovery capability.

Conclusion: ShapKAN enhances the practicality and interpretability of KANs, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments without losing their functional understanding benefits.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adaptive Gated Fusion Network (AGFN) for multimodal sentiment analysis to address issues in modality quality variations, leading to enhanced performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis where simple fusion techniques often fail in handling noisy, missing, or conflicting modalities, resulting in suboptimal predictions.

Method: The paper introduces AGFN, which employs a dual gate fusion mechanism. It uses information entropy and modality importance to adaptively adjust feature weights, mitigating noisy modalities and prioritizing informative ones.

Result: The proposed AGFN outperformed strong baseline methods on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets in accuracy and emotional nuance detection. It also improves generalization by learning broader feature distributions and reducing location-prediction error correlation.

Conclusion: AGFN improves multimodal sentiment analysis by adaptively utilizing modality information, enhancing robustness and addressing limitations of standard fusion techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

*Juncheng Dong,Weibin Mo,Zhengling Qi,Cong Shi,Ethan X. Fang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework for solving assortment optimization problems under data limitations, achieving optimal revenue with finite-sample regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of deriving optimal assortments in offline scenarios with limited historical choice data and insufficient coverage across all options, often due to the combinatorial nature of the problem.

Method: The study proposes the PASTA framework, which adopts a pessimistic principle for assortment selection based on the assumption that the offline data contains an optimal assortment, avoiding the need for exhaustive data coverage.

Result: PASTA achieves finite-sample regret bounds across popular choice models like multinomial and nested logit models. It is also proven to be minimax optimal concerning sample and model complexity and shows superior performance in numerical experiments compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PASTA provides a robust solution to assortment optimization under limited data scenarios, effectively addressing theoretical and practical challenges in achieving optimal expected revenue.

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [312] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOT introduces a unified approach to compare neural networks by jointly optimizing hierarchical layer and neuron mappings, solving issues of depth mismatches and global alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representational similarity methods focus on one-to-one alignment between layers, leading to limited interpretability and complications when networks differ in architecture or depth.

Method: HOT employs a joint optimization framework using Hierarchical Optimal Transport, allowing flexible layer-to-layer coupling and neuron transportation to minimize discrepancy while handling depth variations.

Result: HOT showed superior or comparable alignment quality over traditional methods across vision models, language models, and human neural data, revealing structured correspondences not captured by pairwise techniques.

Conclusion: HOT provides an innovative way to evaluate and align network representations, enabling deeper and more interpretable comparisons, especially for architectures with varying depths.

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the ActiNet model, a self-supervised deep learning approach combined with hidden Markov models (HMM), for human activity recognition (HAR) using wrist-accelerometer data and compares its performance to a traditional RF + HMM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable HAR models to analyze wrist-accelerometer data in large-scale epidemiological studies, and self-supervised learning combined with HMMs could potentially enhance the classification of activity intensity.

Method: ActiNet, a self-supervised 18-layer modified ResNet-V2 model, was trained on CAPTURE-24 dataset participants and integrated with HMM smoothing. It was validated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation and compared to a baseline RF + HMM model.

Result: ActiNet achieved a mean macro F1 score of 0.82 and Cohen's kappa score of 0.86, outperforming the RF + HMM model, which scored 0.77 and 0.81, respectively, across different age and sex subgroups.

Conclusion: The use of ActiNet-HMM improves HAR performance for wrist-accelerometer data and is a promising tool for future epidemiological research analyzing physical activity.

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Motivation: To create an efficient learning framework that uses UAVs to leverage multimodal sensing for better accuracy, generalization, and understanding, while minimizing system latency.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated superior performance in reducing system latency and improving model training compared to existing methods under various data setups.

Conclusion: UAV-assisted federated multimodal learning enhances model performance and minimizes latency, proving its effectiveness as a solution for complex distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

### [315] [Accelerating Attention with Basis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01718)
*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) reformulates attention using Basis Decomposition, enabling faster computations and smaller weights without any loss in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize attention mechanisms in large language and vision-language models to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce Basis Decomposition (BD) to reformulate multi-head projections in attention mechanisms, enabling mathematically guaranteed architecture-agnostic acceleration.

Result: On DeepSeek-V2-Lite, BDA achieves 32% faster key/value projections, reduces weights by 25%, and maintains negligible impacts on perplexity while requiring minimal offline preparation and no retraining.

Conclusion: BDA is a theoretically exact, lossless attention acceleration method that complements existing engineering optimizations for large-scale models.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

### [316] [Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721)
*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses robust temporal-difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation in reinforcement learning under model uncertainties and presents a model-free algorithm with provable performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) aims to ensure reliable performance in uncertain environments by focusing on worst-case scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a robust TD learning algorithm using a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update combined with an outer-loop target-network update for linear function approximation. Robustness is defined by total-variation distance and Wasserstein-1 distance uncertainty sets.

Result: The algorithm achieves an $
\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for obtaining an accurate value estimate without requiring generative access to the MDP.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges theoretical gaps in robust RL by providing non-asymptotic guarantees comparable to non-robust RL, and it extends to robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

*Tanay Rastogi,Anders Karlström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares traditional discrete choice models (DCMs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) for workplace location decision analysis, finding each method has strengths depending on the scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCMs struggle to accurately reflect individual decision-making processes for workplace location choices. The paper aims to explore whether DNNs can offer improved modeling in this domain.

Method: The authors use deep neural network techniques to model workplace location choices and compare their performance against traditional discrete choice models.

Result: DNNs outperform DCMs in capturing complex decision patterns, but DCMs align better with individual attributes influencing workplace distance, particularly for shorter distances.

Conclusion: DNNs and DCMs each have their place in workplace location analysis; choosing the right model depends on the particular requirements of the application.

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

### [318] [Private and Fair Machine Learning: Revisiting the Disparate Impact of Differentially Private SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01744)
*Lea Demelius,Dominik Kowald,Simone Kopeinik,Roman Kern,Andreas Trügler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) impacts fairness and utility in neural network training, analyzing hyperparameter tuning and its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most studies report negative fairness impacts when using DPSGD, with a hypothesis that optimizing hyperparameters directly on private models could mitigate these effects.

Method: The authors evaluate DPSGD's disparate impact across different performance metrics and hyperparameters, alongside testing a variant called DPSGD-Global-Adapt.

Result: Optimizing hyperparameters directly on private models improves fairness and utility trade-offs but does not fully resolve disparate impacts. DPSGD-Global-Adapt exhibits inconsistent robustness.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning enhances utility-fairness outcomes but comes at a cost of privacy leakage, requiring careful balance between privacy, utility, and fairness considerations.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

TL;DR: This paper unifies and compares various learned regularization methods for imaging inverse problems, offering a common framework for clear evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of comparing different learned regularization methods for imaging due to inconsistent architectures and training strategies, and to provide clarity and insights.

Method: The authors collected and unified codes of existing learned regularization frameworks into a single common framework, enabling systematic analysis.

Result: Using the unified framework, the paper systematically compares the strengths and limitations of each approach and provides practical guidelines.

Conclusion: The unified framework and analysis offer valuable insights and guidance for future research and implementation of learned regularization methods in imaging.

Abstract: In recent years, a variety of learned regularization frameworks for solving
inverse problems in imaging have emerged. These offer flexible modeling
together with mathematical insights. The proposed methods differ in their
architectural design and training strategies, making direct comparison
challenging due to non-modular implementations. We address this gap by
collecting and unifying the available code into a common framework. This
unified view allows us to systematically compare the approaches and highlight
their strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into their future
potential. We also provide concise descriptions of each method, complemented by
practical guidelines.

*Bruno Corcuera,Carlos Eiras-Franco,Brais Cancela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) approach to enhance latent representations in vision tasks, by filtering noisy or irrelevant features to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent representations in vision models are often affected by irrelevant or noisy features, reducing performance and generalization.

Method: The paper introduces an unsupervised DFS method to dynamically identify and remove misleading information from visual inputs, without requiring labeled data.

Result: Experiments on image datasets show improved generalization in clustering and image generation tasks with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed DFS method enhances latent representations, enabling better performance and generalization across multiple tasks without relying on labeled data.

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Octax introduces a GPU-accelerated suite of classic arcade games for reinforcement learning, enabling massive scalability and speed improvements compared to CPU-based alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning research requires environments that are diverse, computationally efficient, and scalable, which traditional video games fail to sufficiently provide.

Method: The authors implemented CHIP-8-based arcade game environments in JAX, leveraging GPUs for large-scale experimentation while maintaining fidelity to original game dynamics.

Result: Octax demonstrated orders-of-magnitude faster training speeds for RL agents across multiple arcade genres compared to CPU-based environments.

Conclusion: Octax's modular and GPU-optimized design serves as a scalable and extensible environment, advancing large-scale reinforcement learning experimentation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

*Clémentine Courtès,Emmanuel Franck,Michael Kraus,Laurent Navoret,Léopold Trémant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics with numerical stability in long-term simulations and proposes two effective training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address numerical instability and gauge dependency in learning and simulating non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics.

Method: Two training strategies are developed: direct learning of vector fields and learning time-discrete dynamics via explicit schemes.

Result: Numerical tests demonstrate success in learning complex dynamics, such as guiding center motion in plasma physics.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively handle structure preservation and stability, enabling accurate long-term predictions in physical dynamics.

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critically evaluates post-hoc privacy filters for synthetic medical datasets and finds them insufficient to ensure patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in medical AI by synthesizing privacy-preserving datasets while verifying the effectiveness of privacy filters.

Method: The researchers rigorously evaluated a filtering pipeline used in generating synthetic chest X-ray datasets and analyzed its specificity, consistency, and sensitivity.

Result: The evaluated filters showed high sensitivity for real images but were inconsistent and failed to reliably identify near-duplicates from training data.

Conclusion: Current post-hoc filtering methods are inadequate for safeguarding patient privacy, and substantial improvements in filter design are necessary for safe deployment.

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

*Meng-Hsi Chen,Yu-Ang Lee,Feng-Ting Liao,Da-shan Shiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel design for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), called Hourglass MLPs, which uses wide-narrow-wide configurations instead of the conventional narrow-wide-narrow design, leading to better computational efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge conventional MLP designs and explore whether an alternative structural arrangement in skip connections and bottlenecks can improve computational and performance efficiency.

Method: The proposed Hourglass MLPs feature a wide-narrow-wide design with skip connections at expanded dimensions and computation through narrow bottlenecks. Input signals are projected to higher dimensions, and this projection remains fixed at random initialization during training.

Result: Hourglass MLPs consistently outperform conventional MLP designs in performance-parameter trade-offs on generative tasks. The optimal configurations scale differently, favoring deeper networks with wider skips and narrower bottlenecks as parameter budgets increase.

Conclusion: The proposed Hourglass MLP design suggests rethinking skip connection placement in neural networks. The findings may have broader implications for modern architectures such as Transformers and residual networks.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Query Attention (SQA) reduces computational complexity in the Transformer architecture by minimizing the number of Query heads, enabling faster processing of long sequences with minimal quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based architectures struggle with quadratic computational overhead for tasks involving long contexts, and existing solutions address memory bottlenecks but not the fundamental FLOPs issue.

Method: SQA modifies the attention mechanism by reducing Query heads rather than Key/Value heads, achieving computational efficiency proportional to the reduction in Query heads.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on long sequences show throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-heavy scenarios like pre-training and fine-tuning, with minimal loss in model quality.

Conclusion: SQA offers a promising optimization path for scaling Transformers efficiently, improving throughput while maintaining acceptable model performance in long-sequence settings.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for combinatorial optimization with improved sample efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical optimization methods like EDAs struggle with the cost and inefficiency of learning explicit variable dependencies in complex scenarios.

Method: The framework uses a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained with variable order invariance through randomized generation orders and adapts Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The proposed method outperforms benchmarks across diverse problem instances and avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: This approach improves search-space diversity and sample efficiency, addressing limitations of traditional optimization techniques.

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates leveraging dataset descriptions and statistical information for pre-hoc model prediction to reduce computational demands in AutoML workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AutoML methods rely heavily on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, which are computationally intense. Exploring pre-hoc methods can bypass these searches and improve model selection efficiency.

Method: The study employs traditional models and Large Language Model agents to pre-select models based on dataset descriptions and statistical details, applied to the AWS AutoGluon dataset containing 175 tabular classification datasets.

Result: By applying their approach, the computational demands of AutoML workflows are significantly reduced, while maintaining effective model selection.

Conclusion: The methodology proposes a shift in AutoML workflows by integrating pre-hoc model selection, potentially marking a step change in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a method for learning representations of logical specifications and systems using contrastive learning, which outperforms alternatives and generalizes well to complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored field of representation learning in formal verification, specifically using deep learning to optimize model checking for safety-critical systems.

Method: The authors propose CNML, which embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space via a self-supervised contrastive learning objective, effectively aligning their representations within this space.

Result: CNML outperforms both neural and algorithmic baselines in tasks involving the alignment of formal specifications and systems, excels in generalization to complex formulas, and transfers well to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that model checking can be effectively used as an objective for learning representations for formal languages, demonstrating the potential of CNML in improving formal verification tasks.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

*Lexiang Hu,Yikang Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LieNLSD, the first method capable of discovering nonlinear symmetries and their explicit expressions, showing superiority in improving dynamic systems and guiding data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and leveraging symmetries help in tasks like designing equivariant networks and discovering governing equations, but identifying nonlinear symmetries and the corresponding Lie algebra subspace has been challenging.

Method: LieNLSD uses a function library for group action, converts the problem into solving a linear system for a coefficient matrix (via SVD), and employs neural networks and differential data analysis.

Result: LieNLSD demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as top quark tagging and dynamic systems, achieving qualitative advantages and a 20% improvement in neural PDE solver accuracy.

Conclusion: LieNLSD significantly advances symmetry discovery by uncovering nonlinear symmetries explicitly, showcasing practical benefits in improving data augmentation and dynamic system modeling.

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the OCO framework by addressing adversarial constraints where even a common feasible point among constraints may not exist.

Method: The constrained learning problem is reduced to a standard OCO problem using specially designed surrogate cost functions.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve universal dynamic regret bounds and cumulative constraint violation bounds, surpassing the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The research provides a significant extension of OCO, demonstrating scalable methods for handling adversarial scenarios effectively.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization

having simple modular structures that yield universal dynamic regret and
cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the state-of-the-art
results. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and
constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint
functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are
established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

### [331] [Randomized Gradient Subspaces for Efficient Large Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01878)
*Sahar Rajabi,Nayeema Nonta,Samanvay Vajpayee,Sirisha Rambhatla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GrassWalk and GrassJump, novel algorithms for reducing memory usage during large language model training by exploiting gradient subspaces, showing state-of-the-art memory savings and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs is hindered by extreme memory demands, particularly from optimizer states. There is a need to understand gradient dynamics and subspaces to optimize memory usage without compromising model training quality.

Method: The paper analyzes gradient dynamics, focusing on subspace properties and geometry, and develops randomized algorithms (GrassWalk and GrassJump) that exploit these properties for efficient memory usage.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art memory savings and enhance performance when pretraining LLaMA-1B and LLaMA-7B models.

Conclusion: Gradient subspaces have exploitable properties for reducing memory costs in LLM training. GrassWalk and GrassJump offer a novel approach that saves memory and improves training efficiency.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

*Thomas Gravier,Thomas Boyer,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMtSBM, a method for reconstructing temporal dynamics from static snapshots, showing strong performance including in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the paper is to overcome the limitations of current methods that struggle with scalability in high-dimensional data and require restrictive assumptions, aiming to reconstruct hidden dynamics in natural processes such as cellular differentiation and disease progression.

Method: The method extends Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching by creating an algorithm, Iterative Markovian Fitting, which efficiently handles multi-marginal settings in a factorized manner, enabling video generation from unpaired static data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MMtSBM maintains theoretical robustness in synthetic examples and achieves state-of-the-art results in high-dimensional datasets like transcriptomics and images.

Conclusion: MMtSBM establishes multi-marginal Schrödinger bridges as a scalable and principled approach to uncover hidden temporal dynamics from static datasets, opening new possibilities in high-dimensional and complex data analysis.

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

*Md Talha Mohsin,Ismail Abdulrashid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal foundation model using transformers to integrate diverse healthcare data for enhanced disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic models analyze healthcare data sources like EHR and medical imaging in isolation, limiting their ability to detect cross-modal correlations critical for early disease diagnosis.

Method: The proposed model uses an attention-based transformer framework, with modality-specific encoders mapping data into a shared latent space. The data is combined using multi-head attention and residual normalization, enabling pretraining for adaptability to various diseases and datasets.

Result: Experimental validation through benchmarks in oncology, cardiology, and neurology demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in early detection tasks.

Conclusion: The multimodal framework enhances diagnostic precision and decision-making while incorporating transparency and clinical interpretability, progressing toward an integrated model for precision healthcare.

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

*Mayur Kishor Shende,Ole-Christoffer Granmo,Runar Helin,Vladimir I. Zadorozhny,Rishad Shafik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the Tsetlin Machine (TM) and its interpretability in large-scale RGB image classification, introducing methods for visualization and local/global interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of interpretability and explainability in neural network-based models, leveraging the inherently interpretable Tsetlin Machine.

Method: They propose techniques to generate local interpretations (explaining individual predictions) and global class representations (summarizing patterns per class), which can be visualized as images. The study evaluates performance on large, complex datasets.

Result: The TM achieved 98.5% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56% F1-score on CelebA, competing closely with ResNet50's F1-score (88.07%) while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: The TM is competitive with deep learning models like ResNet50 and provides better interpretability, making it suitable for large-scale and diverse image classification tasks.

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

*Zhaoyan Wang,Zheng Gao,Arogya Kharel,In-Young Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the robustness of GNNs in the presence of compound deficiencies in graph-structured data and introduces RoGRAD, a retrieval-augmented iterative learning framework, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the insufficient understanding of GNNs' and LLM-enhanced methods' performance under compound deficiencies in real-world graphs, and to compare traditional and LLM-augmented approaches systematically.

Method: The method involves an empirical benchmarking study of GNNs and LLM-enhanced frameworks under different graph deficiencies, followed by the development of RoGRAD. This framework iteratively employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for class-consistent augmentations and enforces discriminative representations using contrastive graph learning.

Result: RoGRAD demonstrated superiority over both conventional GNNs and LLM-augmented methods, achieving up to an 82.43% improvement in performance metrics.

Conclusion: RoGRAD transforms static signal injections into dynamic refinement for LLM-augmented graph learning, providing a more robust and effective solution compared to existing frameworks and highlighting previously unknown vulnerabilities in such systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

### [336] [StelLA: Subspace Learning in Low-rank Adaptation using Stiefel Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01938)
*Zhizhong Li,Sina Sajadmanesh,Jingtao Li,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometry-aware extension of LoRA using a three-factor decomposition ($USV^\top$) inspired by SVD, incorporating optimization on the Stiefel manifold to improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA is widely used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning but still underperforms full fine-tuning due to insufficient leveraging of low-rank manifold structures.

Method: The paper proposes a three-factor decomposition approach ($USV^\top$) for LoRA, ensuring orthonormality of $U$ and $V$ via Stiefel manifold constraints. It uses a modular geometric optimization technique that turns Euclidean optimizers into Riemannian ones.

Result: Experiments across diverse tasks—like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and image classification—show that this geometric extension outperforms prior state-of-the-art LoRA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware LoRA significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing broad applicability across downstream tasks while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

*Yujie Zhou,Pengyang Ling,Jiazi Bu,Yibin Wang,Yuhang Zang,Jiaqi Wang,Li Niu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Granular-GRPO framework for aligning generative flow models with human preferences, addressing sparse and narrow reward signals by improving reward assessments through novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches integrating reinforcement learning with generative models underutilize rewards due to sparse and narrow reward signals, leading to suboptimal preference alignment.

Method: The paper proposes a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy for step-wise exploration tied to noise-reward correlation and a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module to aggregate advantages across multiple diffusion scales.

Result: Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline GRPO methods in preference alignment.

Conclusion: The Granular-GRPO framework provides a more precise and robust reward assessment method, effectively advancing reinforcement learning for flow models in preference alignment tasks.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

*Yuanyuan Yao,Yuhan Shi,Lu Chen,Ziquan Fang,Yunjun Gao,Leong Hou U,Yushuai Li,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a supervised framework, Moon, for multivariate time series anomaly detection, using a novel image encoding technique and a multimodal neural network, achieving superior efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the paper is to address the challenges in MTS anomaly detection: inaccuracies in threshold-based methods, underutilization of anomaly labels, high computational costs, and the inability of traditional methods to capture local relationships or manage labeled data scarcity.

Method: The authors propose Moon, which converts numeric time series data into image representations using a multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique, integrates them with numeric data through a Multimodal-CNN with parameter sharing, and explains anomalies using a SHAP-based explainer.

Result: Moon demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, improving efficiency by up to 93%, accuracy by 4%, and interpretation performance by 10.8% across six real-world MTS datasets.

Conclusion: The Moon framework effectively addresses key limitations in MTS anomaly detection, offering significant gains in detection precision, computational efficiency, and anomaly interpretability.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

### [339] [Private Federated Multiclass Post-hoc Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01987)
*Samuel Maddock,Graham Cormode,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses federated machine learning model calibration by adapting traditional calibration methods to a privacy-focused federated setting and introducing strategies for mitigating accuracy degradation under heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring that predicted probabilities reflect true outcomes is critical for applications like healthcare and finance, where federated learning must consider privacy constraints and model reliability.

Method: The paper integrates calibration techniques like histogram binning and temperature scaling into federated learning settings with user-level Differential Privacy. It proposes new strategies to address client heterogeneity.

Result: Federated temperature scaling performed best under Differential Privacy constraints, while weighted binning was most effective without them, demonstrating a tradeoff based on privacy requirements.

Conclusion: The study highlights effective calibration methods for federated learning models, catering to both privacy-sensitive environments and non-private federated setups.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "PepCompass," a geometry-aware framework for antimicrobial peptide discovery that excels in exploring peptide space and optimizing activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is hindered by the vast peptide space size and the shortage of peptides with significant activity. Conventional methods rely on flat Euclidean metrics, which distort exploration and fail to address the true geometric complexity of peptide data.

Method: The authors developed PepCompass, which encompasses a union of Riemannian manifolds ($\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$) to capture peptide space geometry. It integrates local exploration methods: second-order Riemannian Brownian motion sampling, tangent-space mutation enumeration, and an algorithm combining the two (LE-BO) for local activity optimization. Additionally, PoGS is presented for interpolating prototype embeddings along enriched geodesics to bias discovery toward active peptides.

Result: In-vitro validation demonstrated the capability of PoGS to discover four novel seeds (favorable peptides). Following LE-BO optimization, 25 peptides showed high activity, including effectiveness against resistant bacterial strains.

Conclusion: The study establishes a geometry-informed exploration paradigm that enhances the efficiency and precision of antimicrobial peptide design, outperforming conventional approaches.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

*Guolei Zeng,Hezhe Qiao,Guoguo Ai,Jinsong Guo,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods, proposing a framework called GraphNC to improve normality learning by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of current semi-supervised GAD methods, which often overfit to labeled normal nodes and lead to high detection errors, such as false positives.

Method: The method involves a new framework, GraphNC, which uses anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg) to improve anomaly detection by optimizing scores and making the representation of normal nodes more compact.

Result: GraphNC improves separability of anomaly scores and enhances regularization of graph normality in representation space, addressing issues caused by inaccurate scores from teacher models.

Conclusion: GraphNC successfully overcomes the limitations of existing semi-supervised GAD methods, ensuring better calibration of graph normality through innovative alignment and regularization strategies.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

TL;DR: The study introduces a contrastive learning framework aimed at reducing bias in AI models for tabular data using self-supervised and supervised techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness in AI systems is both a technical and moral necessity to ensure unbiased and equitable outcomes.

Method: The framework focuses on strategically picking positive sample pairs and uses both self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning to reduce biases in tabular data.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing contrastive learning methods for tabular data in terms of bias reduction, with minimal impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: The research validates the framework's effectiveness in achieving fair representations, which can be applied to a range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the underlying mathematical foundation of densely connected deep neural networks to optimize their performance and stability.

Method: The authors model densely connected networks as nonlinear integral equations, analyze training as an optimal control problem, and use Γ-convergence and the piecewise linear extension for convergence proofs.

Result: They demonstrate the convergence of optimal values and subsequence convergence of minimizers, transitioning the training problem to its continuous-time counterpart.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of densely connected architectures, showing their potential in creating stable and efficient training environments for deep models.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li,Shihua Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses the train-inference gap in Flow Matching (FM) generative models and introduces fine-tuning strategies via Maximum Likelihood Estimation to improve inference accuracy, particularly for robotic manipulation and image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FM performs well in generative tasks but struggles with a train-inference gap, limiting performance in high precision applications such as robotic manipulation.

Method: The authors analyze FM's train-inference relationship and introduce fine-tuning methods using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, including straightforward and residual-based approaches.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved inference performance of FM in tasks like image generation and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning FM using Maximum Likelihood Estimation enhances robustness, interpretability, and inference performance, addressing critical gaps in its original formulation.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Zheya Wang,Hongxiao Li,Yifan Wang,Lei Wang,Chunjie Luo,Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAIROS introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting on the web by prioritizing non-autoregressive methods that enhance real-time decision-making and avoid errors common in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive forecasting in web applications, which suffer from error accumulation and lack responsiveness for real-time decisions.

Method: KAIROS employs a non-autoregressive forecasting framework that models segment-level multi-peak distributions to circumvent error accumulation and improve inference precision.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization on benchmarks, delivering performance comparable to cutting-edge foundation models but with lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Non-autoregressive forecasting frameworks like KAIROS offer a scalable and efficient paradigm, making them crucial for time series modeling in dynamic web applications.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

*Yu-Chien Liao,Jr-Jen Chen,Chi-Pin Huang,Ci-Siang Lin,Meng-Lin Wu,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNS, a method for personalizing diffusion models incrementally by identifying and finetuning concept-specific neurons, while preserving prior knowledge and zero-shot text-to-image abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenge of updating diffusion models in incremental real-world applications.

Method: CNS identifies key neurons related to target concepts and finetunes them incrementally to maintain prior knowledge and minimize catastrophic forgetting.

Result: CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter tuning, excelling in single and multi-concept personalization, and operates efficiently by being fusion-free.

Conclusion: CNS offers an efficient and effective solution for continual personalization of diffusion models, balancing performance and resource usage while addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

*Damian Falk,Konstantin Schürholt,Konstantinos Tzevelekakis,Léo Meynent,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to train weight space representations of neural networks using arbitrary, unstructured models from large repositories (e.g., Hugging Face), eliminating the need for carefully curated model zoos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the limitations of current weight space learning methodologies, which rely on computationally expensive, curated model zoos, thereby restricting scalability and flexibility.

Method: The authors developed a new weight space learning backbone designed to handle heterogeneous, unstructured models from large repositories. It is trained using neural network weights from repositories such as Hugging Face, which contain diverse, undocumented models.

Result: The proposed approach achieves strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on curated model zoos. It also generalizes well to unseen data modalities due to the diversity of the training set.

Conclusion: Curated model zoos are no longer indispensable for weight space learning, as high-quality representations can be learned effectively using models from unstructured repositories. This marks a significant advancement in the field of weight space learning.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

*Runqian Wang,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework that employs equilibrium dynamics to surpass traditional diffusion and flow models in generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics used in traditional generative modeling approaches like diffusion and flow-based models.

Method: EqM learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape and uses optimization-based sampling, involving gradient descent with adjustable parameters during the inference phase.

Result: EqM achieves superior generative performance, achieving an FID score of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256, and supports additional functionalities like image denoising and OOD detection.

Conclusion: EqM bridges flow and energy-based models more closely, offering flexibility and enhanced performance through equilibrium dynamics and optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

*Klaus-Rudolf Kladny,Bernhard Schölkopf,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a reformulation of the multi-class exponential loss, to improve optimization and regularization in boosting frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost uses exponential loss, which is challenging to optimize with first-order methods. The goal is to address these optimization challenges while retaining and enhancing AdaBoost's generalization abilities.

Method: The paper presents PENEX, optimizing the multi-class exponential loss with first-order methods, and links it to implicit margin maximization and weak learner parameterization.

Result: PENEX demonstrates superior regularization on computer vision and language tasks compared to established methods, with manageable computational costs.

Conclusion: PENEX offers a promising AdaBoost-inspired approach for training and fine-tuning deep neural networks, combining theoretical grounding with practical effectiveness.

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

*Milad Firoozeh,Nader Dashti,Mohammad Ali Hatefi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and predicts residential gas consumption in Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, focusing on overcoming seasonal shortages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iran faces annual gas outages during cold seasons due to increasing population and energy use. Efficient management of residential gas consumption is essential.

Method: Machine learning models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM-XGBoost) were used to analyze six years of gas consumption and meteorology data.

Result: The BiLSTM-XGBoost hybrid model performed best, achieving lower RMSE, MAPE, and MPE than LSTM and GRU models, with strong performance even with limited data.

Conclusion: Hybrid machine learning models, incorporating geographical and climatic factors, are effective tools for predicting and managing gas consumption, reducing seasonal shortages.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

### [351] [DAG DECORation: Continuous Optimization for Structure Learning under Hidden Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02117)
*Samhita Pal,James O'quinn,Kaveh Aryan,Heather Pua,James P. Long,Amir Asiaee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DECOR, a method for learning linear Gaussian SEMs under latent confounding, using a unified, likelihood-based, differentiable approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for structure learning in the presence of latent confounding are limited by assumptions such as independent errors or pervasive factor structures, necessitating a more flexible and robust approach.

Method: The paper proposes DECOR, which alternates between smooth acyclic graph updates and convex noise updates. It introduces global identifiability conditions using a bow-free mixed graph and uniform eigenvalue margin of noise covariance. A bow complementarity penalty or post hoc reconciliation step may also be applied.

Result: DECOR demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to baselines in synthetic experiments across multiple scenarios, including varying confounding density, graph density, and dimensions.

Conclusion: DECOR provides a robust and theoretically grounded approach to jointly learning directed structures and noise models, excelling under non-pervasive confounding and maintaining competitiveness otherwise.

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Catalyst GFlowNet, a machine learning model for generating efficient catalysts tailored for hydrogen energy storage, addressing critical challenges in renewable energy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of renewable energy is hindered by unstable supply; efficient energy storage in the form of hydrogen and affordable catalysts are crucial.

Method: A generative machine learning model, Catalyst GFlowNet, utilizes predictors for formation and adsorption energy to design optimal crystal surfaces for catalysis.

Result: The model successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Conclusion: Catalyst GFlowNet is a promising framework for discovering novel and cost-effective catalysts for hydrogen energy storage and potentially other reactions like oxygen evolution.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), an extension of classifier-free guidance to policy gradient methods, enabling control during testing without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring ways to integrate guidance mechanisms like classifier-free guidance from diffusion models into classical policy gradient methods for improved control and efficiency in reinforcement learning.

Method: PGG interpolates conditional and unconditional policy gradients, introduces a normalization term (vanishing under advantage estimation), and employs training guidance with different parameters.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows PGG improves stability, sample efficiency, controllability, specifically in discrete tasks and low sample regimes, though challenges remain for continuous control.

Conclusion: PGG demonstrates that guidance mechanisms can be adapted from diffusion models to classical reinforcement learning, enabling controllable online learning and suggesting new research directions.

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRACE, a method using Large Language Models to generate interpretable reward functions for Inverse Reinforcement Learning, demonstrated to perform well on benchmarks and multi-task rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Inverse Reinforcement Learning struggles with producing interpretable 'black-box’ reward models, which limits their debugging and trustworthiness.

Method: GRACE combines Large Language Models and evolutionary search to generate interpretable, code-based reward functions from expert demonstrations.

Result: GRACE performs efficiently on BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, yielding accurate reward functions and achieving strong policy performance in comparison to other approaches.

Conclusion: GRACE successfully provides a more interpretable and effective alternative for generating reward models, excelling in complex and multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited serological testing capacities for Chagas disease by prioritizing testing and treatment using ECG-based identification methods.

Method: Teams used machine learning algorithms trained on augmented ECG datasets, including large sets with weak labels and smaller sets with strong labels, evaluated by a metric tailored to local testing capacities.

Result: The challenge attracted 630 participants from 111 teams worldwide, submitting over 1300 entries with varied approaches from academia and industry.

Conclusion: This initiative showcased innovative data strategies and global collaboration, setting a foundation for improved Chagas disease detection and clinical prioritization using ECG data.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces self-attention with recurrent and pooling mechanisms to address challenges with long sequences. The model performs well on raw audio and shows promise for other modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitation of self-attention in handling very long sequences, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models used across domains like NLP and computer vision.

Method: Poolformer replaces self-attention with recurrent layers and integrates pooling operations to reduce sequence length. It is structured using recursive SkipBlocks that include residual blocks, pooling layers, and nested SkipBlocks.

Result: Poolformer accelerates training, improves perceptual metrics, and prevents overfitting. It outperforms state-of-the-art models on raw audio tasks, demonstrating effective handling of long-range and short-term dependencies.

Conclusion: Poolformer is an efficient alternative to self-attention-based models, excelling in tasks with long sequences like audio data. Future work could explore its applications in text, vision, and multi-modal data processing.

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are tested in a new benchmark, StockBench, which evaluates their performance in dynamic stock trading environments. Results show mixed performance, with challenges in outperforming basic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of exploration of dynamic financial decision-making by language models, focusing on the finance domain's practical relevance to high-stakes decision-making and economic impact.

Method: Introducing StockBench, a dynamic benchmark simulating multi-month stock-trading tasks with agent decisions assessed through financial metrics like cumulative return and Sortino ratio.

Result: Most LLM agents fail to outperform basic buy-and-hold strategies, but some models show promise in both higher returns and risk management efficacy.

Conclusion: While promising, LLMs face significant challenges in dynamic financial decision-making. StockBench provides a foundation for reproducibility and future advancements in financial agent research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiFFPO, a framework to train masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for faster and better reasoning by leveraging reinforcement learning. It enhances sample efficiency, task performance, and inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach for training dLLMs that improves both reasoning performance and inference speed, addressing existing inefficiencies.

Method: The framework unifies existing methods using off-policy RL for surrogate policy training, applies a two-stage likelihood approximation with importance sampling, and jointly trains efficient samplers with the dLLMs policy.

Result: The method achieved improved accuracy, sample efficiency, and reduced number of function evaluations (NFEs), alongside a better Pareto frontier of inference-time compute.

Conclusion: DiFFPO demonstrates significant advancements in training dLLMs for math and planning tasks, optimizing both accuracy and computational efficiency through its novel pipeline.

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging auxiliary learning and attention mechanisms to address the challenges of training recommendation models on heterogeneous user populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard recommendation models often assume user homogeneity, but real-world data is highly heterogeneous, dominated by central patterns that overshadow minority cohorts.

Method: The authors introduce a data inspection approach using auxiliary learning, where partially conflicting auxiliary labels are used to regularize shared representations in attention mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on massive datasets demonstrate improved global performance and fine-grained capture of user-ad interactions, with up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy and over 0.30% gains for minority cohorts.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances learning across heterogeneous user populations, addressing imbalances in global models while preserving the performance for minority groups.

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

*Runzhe Zhan,Yafu Li,Zhi Wang,Xiaoye Qu,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao,Derek F. Wong,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExGRPO, a novel framework for reinforcement learning that organizes valuable experiences in large reasoning models, showing consistent improvements in reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies and instability in current reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning tasks in large language models, aiming to make better use of past experiences.

Method: The authors propose ExGRPO, a framework that prioritizes valuable experiences based on rollout correctness and entropy, and balances exploration with experience exploitation using a mixed-policy objective.

Result: ExGRPO demonstrated consistent improvement in reasoning performance, achieving an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over traditional RLVR across five models and enhanced stability during training.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of principled experience management in reinforcement learning as crucial for efficient and scalable improvements in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

*Maximilian Beck,Kajetan Schweighofer,Sebastian Böck,Sebastian Lehner,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM across various training and inference scenarios, showing xLSTM's superior efficiency as context lengths increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how alternative architectures like xLSTM, which offer linear complexity, compare to Transformers in terms of scaling laws, particularly in training efficiency and inference performance.

Method: The study evaluates xLSTM vs. Transformer scaling under compute-optimal and over-training regimes using IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches. It spans model sizes from 80M to 7B and analyzes scaling concerning both model size and context length.

Result: xLSTM demonstrates favorable scaling compared to Transformers under typical LLM training and inference scenarios, particularly as training and inference contexts grow longer.

Conclusion: xLSTM presents a viable and advantageous alternative to Transformers for large language models, especially in scenarios requiring extensive context lengths.

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

*Ricardo Misael Ayala Molina,Hyame Assem Alameddine,Makan Pourzandi,Chadi Assi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PUL-Inter-Slice Defender, a machine learning anomaly detection solution that secures 5G networks against Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks using Positive Unlabeled Learning and Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders combined with K-Means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the vulnerability introduced by Inter-Slice Switching (ISS) in 5G networks, which can be exploited for Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

Method: The paper proposes PUL-Inter-Slice Defender, which employs Positive Unlabeled Learning with Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means clustering, using 3GPP key performance indicators and performance measurement counters as features for the machine learning models.

Result: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved over 98.50% F1-scores on datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently surpassing its counterpart and other solutions like OCSVM combined with Random Forest and XGBoost, when tested on data from a 5G testbed.

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender is a highly robust and effective solution for detecting DSM attacks in 5G networks, even in scenarios with contaminated training data, outperforming existing methods and enhancing security for network slices.

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

*Ruohao Guo,Afshin Oroojlooy,Roshan Sridhar,Miguel Ballesteros,Alan Ritter,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DialTree-RPO, a new reinforcement learning framework with tree search, to autonomously identify multi-turn attack strategies exploiting vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs), achieving superior performance compared to past methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) under multi-turn interaction contexts, where adaptive and strategic dialogues pose a greater challenge than single-turn attacks, and to overcome the limitations of manually curated data and template-driven methods.

Method: The authors developed DialTree-RPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search, that autonomously explores and discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating dialogue dynamics as a sequential decision-making problem, eliminating dependence on human intervention.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated over 25.9% higher attack success rate (ASR) across 10 target LLMs compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, while systematically uncovering new multi-turn attack strategies.

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO effectively exposes LLM vulnerabilities to multi-turn adversarial attacks by autonomously discovering optimized strategies, showcasing its potential to advance AI safety research.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training approaches lack the flexibility to dynamically address instabilities or training challenges.

Method: Interactive Training integrates a control server for real-time communication, enabling adjustment of training parameters, data, and model settings by human experts or AI agents.

Result: Three case studies show improved stability, reduced hyperparameter sensitivity, and better adaptability to user requirements.

Conclusion: The approach lays groundwork for autonomous AI-driven optimization during neural network training for better performance and problem-solving.

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined

Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,

mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

### [365] [Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259)
*Tobias Kreiman,Yutong Bai,Fadi Atieh,Elizabeth Weaver,Eric Qu,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores using pure Transformers, without predefined graphs or physical priors, for predicting molecular properties and finds that they achieve competitive accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular machine learning heavily relies on graph-based methods such as GNNs, which may limit expressivity and scalability due to hard-coded biases and sparse graph operations.

Method: The research employs standard Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates without predefined graphs, comparing their performance against state-of-the-art GNNs using the OMol25 dataset, under matched compute budgets.

Result: Transformers produce competitive energy and force prediction errors, learn physically consistent patterns adaptively (e.g., attention decay with interatomic distance), and benefit from predictable improvements with scaling.

Conclusion: Transformers can adaptively exhibit favorable properties of GNNs, challenging the need for predefined graph structures and paving the way for scalable architectures in molecular modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

*Yalin E. Sagduyu,Tugba Erpek,Kemal Davaslioglu,Sastry Kompella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses mitigating reactive jamming using reinforcement learning techniques, focusing on adapting transmission strategies in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to counteract dynamic channel-jamming strategies by designing systems that can intelligently adapt without prior knowledge of conditions or jammer methods.

Method: Reinforcement learning techniques, including Q-learning for discrete states and Deep Q-Networks for continuous states, were employed to optimize transmission parameters in response to jamming.

Result: Results demonstrate that reinforcement learning effectively adapts to changing spectrum dynamics, enabling sustained high transmission rates despite shifting channels and jamming strategies.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides a robust solution for mitigating reactive jamming by enabling dynamic adaptation to spectrum and jamming policy changes.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

*Kyoungjun Park,Yifan Yang,Changhan Ge,Lili Qiu,Shiqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Diffusion^2, a 3D point cloud-based method to accurately model RF signal propagation across various frequencies and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RF signal modeling struggles with complex interactions involving absorption and reflection among obstacles, and RGB cameras are limited in environmental sensing.

Method: Diffusion^2 combines 3D point cloud data and a novel RF-3D Encoder for signal-specific and geometric feature extraction. Multi-scale embedding simulates RF dissemination.

Result: Diffusion^2 achieves highly accurate RF signal estimation with an error margin of 1.9 dB and operates 27x faster than the previous methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion^2 represents a major advancement for RF signal modeling with enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

*Fedor Velikonivtsev,Oleg Platonov,Gleb Bazhenov,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current traffic forecasting benchmarks and introduces improved datasets for city traffic networks, along with a scalable graph neural network model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic forecasting datasets lack road connectivity details, rich road properties, and sufficient road segments, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors created new datasets with detailed road features, including traffic volume and speed data, for urban environments. They also designed a scalable GNN model that omits temporal sequence modules.

Result: The new datasets challenge existing neural models to scale effectively, and the proposed GNN demonstrates improved scalability and forecasting accuracy in dense city traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The work contributes better benchmarks and a scalable modeling approach for traffic forecasting, promoting advancements in urban traffic prediction research.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

*Mykyta Ielanskyi,Kajetan Schweighofer,Lukas Aichberger,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in large language models, specifically confabulations caused by predictive uncertainty, by proposing improved methods for evaluating uncertainty estimation in natural language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs, especially confabulations caused by predictive uncertainty, reduce their reliability, necessitating robust methods to better evaluate uncertainty estimation.

Method: The authors introduce alternative risk indicators, utilize multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants to reduce evaluation biases, explore structured and challenging tasks, and propose using Elo ratings for summarizing performance across evaluations.

Result: Improved robustness and reduced evaluation biases for uncertainty estimation methods were achieved through new indicators, structured tasks, and Elo ratings.

Conclusion: Their proposed evaluation framework enhances the reliability of assessing uncertainty estimation methods in natural language generation tasks, providing a more robust and fair testing process.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for detecting if a student model has been distilled from a teacher model, relying only on the student's weights and the teacher's API.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about model provenance and unauthorized replication via distillation.

Method: A model-agnostic framework is proposed that combines data-free input synthesis and statistical score computation to detect distillation.

Result: Tests on classification and generative models showed significant improvements in detection accuracy compared to baseline methods on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and text-to-image generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances the detection accuracy, addressing the challenge of verifying model distillation effectively.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

*Dhruv Kohli,Sawyer J. Robertson,Gal Mishne,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGO, a spectral method, enhances tangent space estimation by using graph Laplacian eigenvectors to counteract high-noise issues in data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the critical limitations of Local Principal Component Analysis (LPCA) in estimating tangent spaces when dealing with high noise and the lack of prior knowledge about data geometry and noise.

Method: The proposed LEGO technique orthogonalizes the gradients of low-frequency Laplacian eigenvectors, leveraging global data structure instead of relying on local neighborhoods.

Result: LEGO provides tangent space estimations that exhibit higher robustness to noise compared to LPCA, enabling improvements in manifold learning, boundary detection, and intrinsic dimension estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The LEGO method effectively addresses noise issues and improves local tangent space estimation using global spectral properties, with promising theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

*Anna Kuzina,Maciej Pioro,Paul N. Whatmough,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'KaVa,' a framework that bridges the gap between explicit reasoning (CoT) and latent reasoning by self-distilling knowledge from the KV-cache of teacher models to latent-reasoning students. It improves efficiency and effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive and verbose. Latent reasoning provides efficiency but lacks supervision, which limits its performance on complex reasoning tasks. The paper seeks to address this trade-off.

Method: The authors propose 'KaVa,' a framework that leverages self-distillation to transfer knowledge from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher model into the student model. This is achieved using continuous latent tokens to align the KV trajectories of teacher and student.

Result: KaVa consistently outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, handles complex natural-language reasoning effectively, and scales to larger models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that compressed KV-cache distillation can effectively serve as a supervision signal for latent reasoning, striking a balance between the accuracy of CoT and the efficiency of latent inference, making reasoning models both effective and deployable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes microscaling floating-point formats for efficient memory and computational usage in large language models, achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for computational and memory resources by LLMs motivated the authors to create efficient methods that reduce these overheads without sacrificing model performance.

Method: The paper introduces microscaling floating-point formats, which share a scale across blocks of values to enable compact and efficient numerical representations, tested within the GPT-2 architecture using 8-bit formats.

Result: Microscaling floating-point data formats were proven effective as they significantly reduced memory and computational costs while maintaining competitive accuracy during both training and inference.

Conclusion: Microscaling floating-point formats represent a promising method for enhancing resource efficiency in deploying large language models, with publicly available source code for replication and further research.

Abstract: The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models
(LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without
compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point
formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the
storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in
LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a
dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a
block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while
maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of
microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly
reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several
configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture,
demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy
during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient
alternative for deploying LLMs at scale. The source code is publicly available

TL;DR: The paper introduces VarCoNet, a self-supervised framework for extracting functional connectomes from resting-state fMRI data, leveraging inter-individual variability and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is fundamental to advancing precision medicine and addressing challenges in rs-fMRI data analysis.

Method: VarCoNet employs a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework enhanced with a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. It processes rs-fMRI using a segmentation-based augmentation strategy.

Result: VarCoNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods in tasks like subject fingerprinting (Human Connectome Project) and autism classification (ABIDE datasets), showing higher robustness, interpretability, and generalizability.

Conclusion: VarCoNet emerges as a powerful and reliable framework for functional connectome analysis, providing advanced solutions for downstream tasks in precision medicine.

Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to
precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual
variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an
enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)
extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs
self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional
inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that
generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the
absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel
augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,
VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series
processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our
VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject
fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii)
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the
ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our
extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning
methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and
generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework
for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.

*Michal Werner,David Čapek,Tomáš Musil,Ondřej Franěk,Tomáš Báča,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an onboard UAV system for long-range flights in GNSS-denied environments, utilizing lightweight drift-correction and real-time computation on CPU-only hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling reliable UAV flight in GNSS-denied scenarios, focusing on minimizing odometry drift and operating in unseen areas using limited computational resources.

Method: The system uses LiDAR-derived local heightmaps matched to prior geo-data heightmaps via gradient-template matching, fused with odometry in a clustered particle filter for drift correction.

Result: During competition deployment, the UAV system successfully navigated across diverse terrains for kilometer-scale flights, reducing drift significantly relative to raw odometry.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of long-range UAV flight in GNSS-denied environments using computationally efficient methods, providing insights for future UAV autonomy designs.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a motion planning strategy combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safe vessel navigation in narrow waterways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of autonomous vessel motion planning in narrow inland waterways, where conventional methods are computationally intensive or overly conservative.

Method: A strategy combining MPC and CBFs is proposed, utilizing time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation to adaptively reduce controller conservativeness and ensure vessel safety.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show the strategy enables safe, real-time navigation of narrow spaces and resolves potential deadlocks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances safety and efficiency, making it suitable for autonomous vessel operations in constrained environments.

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots (CRs) using factor-graph optimization and Gaussian processes to address sensitivity to unmodeled disturbances and data dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing state estimation methods for continuum robots, which rely on complex models or simplistic approximations, and are sensitive to unmodeled disturbances.

Method: Proposes a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework using factor-graph optimization, introducing factors based on continuous-time kinematics corrupted by a Gaussian process noise model. The method is adaptable to unmodeled forces and data dropout, paired with high-rate sensing.

Result: The method provides estimates of the robot’s pose, velocity, and strain along with their covariance, which can be continuously interpolated in time or space. It achieves linear computational complexity concerning time and operates in constant time for interpolation queries.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is highly adaptable, efficient, and versatile for real-world continuum robots, demonstrated on a CR with gyroscope and pose sensors.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

*Arthur Zhang,Xiangyun Meng,Luca Calliari,Dong-Ki Kim,Shayegan Omidshafiei,Joydeep Biswas,Ali Agha,Amirreza Shaban*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VENTURA introduces a novel approach to robot navigation by finetuning image diffusion models to generate visual path masks for precise navigation, outperforming existing techniques in real-world evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enable robots to adapt to varied human instructions and safely navigate complex environments using advanced vision-language models.

Method: VENTURA finetunes pretrained image diffusion models to generate path masks in image space as visual plans. These masks are paired with behavior-cloning policies to translate them into robot navigation tasks, supervised with self-derived data from tracking models enhanced with captions.

Result: VENTURA showed significant improvements in real-world robot navigation, enhancing object reaching and obstacle avoidance task success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% in both familiar and new scenarios.

Conclusion: VENTURA effectively boosts robot navigation capabilities, showcasing compositional generalization in unseen environments and making progress towards safe, diverse robotic navigation guided by natural language.

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

### [379] [INSIGHT: INference-time Sequence Introspection for Generating Help Triggers in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01389)
*Ulas Berk Karli,Ziyao Shangguan,Tesca FItzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces INSIGHT, a framework to help Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models anticipate failures using token-level uncertainty signals and trigger human assistance. It employs transformers to model uncertainties and compares supervision strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models excel in generalization but lack mechanisms to detect potential failures and request human intervention, which can enhance reliability and effectiveness.

Method: INSIGHT trains compact transformer classifiers on token-level uncertainty signals like entropy, log-probability, and aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty to predict when help is needed. It evaluates strong and weak supervision methods for efficiency.

Result: Strong supervision enables fine-grained uncertainty modeling, while weak labels provide scalable yet competitive results. Temporal modeling of uncertainties with transformers significantly boosts predictive power.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-based introspection is feasible and improves VLA models by enabling active learning and real-time error mitigation through human intervention, with potential for scalable implementations.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

### [380] [Beyond Collision Cones: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Nonholonomic Robots via Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01402)
*Hun Kuk Park,Taekyung Kim,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) to improve safety and feasibility for nonholonomic robots navigating dense environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in dynamic environments are too conservative, especially for nonholonomic robots, leading to infeasibility in dense scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) with dynamically adaptable boundaries based on distance to obstacles and relative velocity.

Result: The DPCBF-based controller outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating higher navigation success rates and feasibility even in cluttered environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles.

Conclusion: DPCBF effectively addresses limitations of conventional approaches, enabling safer and more feasible navigation for autonomous systems in high-density environments.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

### [381] [How Well do Diffusion Policies Learn Kinematic Constraint Manifolds?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01404)
*Lexi Foland,Thomas Cohn,Adam Wei,Nicholas Pfaff,Boyuan Chen,Russ Tedrake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Diffusion policies applied to robot imitation learning can approximate kinematic constraints, but their performance is influenced by dataset size and quality rather than manifold curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the ability of diffusion policies to accurately learn and satisfy kinematic equality constraints in robot tasks, as task performance alone does not fully reveal policy precision.

Method: A case study was conducted on bimanual pick-and-place tasks, analyzing three factors: dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature, with both experimental and hardware evaluations.

Result: Diffusion policies provide a coarse approximation of constraint manifolds and are negatively affected by smaller and lower-quality datasets. The impact of manifold curvature on constraints and task success was inconclusive.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion policies for real-world robotic tasks but emphasize the importance of high-quality, extensive data for precise constraint learning.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

### [382] [Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01986)
*Varun Kotian,Vishrut Jain,Andrea Michelle Rios Lazcano,Daan Marinus Pool,Riender Happee,Barys Shyrokau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a motion cueing algorithm (MCA) using model predictive control (MPC) to reduce motion sickness in driving simulators, balancing fidelity and comfort. Experiments show significant sickness reduction without impacting fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driving simulators often cause motion sickness due to mismatched motion and visuals. Developing an optimal solution to address this issue enables broader and more effective simulator use.

Method: The authors developed an MPC-based motion cueing algorithm, penalizing sensory conflict and specific force errors. They evaluated its performance through human-in-the-loop experiments comparing different motion settings on a hexapod simulator.

Result: No motion yielded the lowest sickness levels with poor fidelity. The compromise MCA solution reduced motion sickness by over 50%, with no significant impact on fidelity ratings compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The motion cueing algorithm balances motion sickness reduction and fidelity, advancing the usability of driving simulators by optimally controlling sensory errors and sickness dynamics.

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

*Anukriti Singh,Kasra Torshizi,Khuzema Habib,Kelin Yu,Ruohan Gao,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT is a novel robot learning framework that utilizes semantic 2D keypoints for efficient manipulation tasks, improving scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot learning methods often rely on dense visual inputs, which are computationally demanding and include irrelevant features. AFFORD2ACT aims to address these limitations by employing affordance-guided keypoints for enhanced scalability and semantic understanding.

Method: This framework uses a three-stage pipeline: 1) affordance filtering to identify relevant features, 2) category-level keypoint construction for semantic representation, and 3) transformer-based policy learning with gating mechanisms for efficient training and decision-making.

Result: The framework achieves a compact 38-dimensional policy state trained in just 15 minutes, delivering high performance in real-time tasks without dense visual inputs. It achieves an 82% success rate on new objects, categories, and challenging environments.

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT enhances robot manipulation tasks by offering a lightweight, efficient, and scalable solution through semantic keypoint extraction and transformer-based learning.

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ongoing challenge of precise powder manipulation in laboratory workflows, which is vital for scientific discovery but remains difficult to automate.

Method: The method involves a framework combining differentiable physics simulation for granular dynamics, low-dimensional skill-space parameterization to simplify optimization, and a curriculum-based approach to improve task competency over extended horizons.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms reinforcement learning baselines in terms of task success rates and stability during powder transport.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the trajectory optimization framework effectively enhances robotic powder manipulation, offering more reliable and efficient solutions for laboratory automation.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: This study explores a cooperative robotic system using haptic feedback to improve tumor localization during breast-conserving surgery, showing enhanced resection margins and reduced user effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast-conserving surgery faces challenges in delineating tumor boundaries due to tumor mobility, non-palpability, and irregular borders.

Method: A haptic robot combined with an electrocautery blade is utilized, guided by ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation, and reinforced with virtual fixture mechanisms during simulated surgical tasks.

Result: Using haptic feedback, users experienced better resection margins and reduced mental demand, frustration, and effort, though there were impacts on surgical workflow requiring adjustments.

Conclusion: The system shows potential to improve tumor localization in breast surgery; future studies will refine the system and validate performance through extensive user testing.

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Motivation: VLMs face significant challenges for real-world robot navigation due to limitations in scene memory, spatial reasoning, and scalability for real-time operations.

Method: VL-KnG constructs spatiotemporal knowledge graphs by processing video sequences in chunks, enabling persistent memory and queryable spatial reasoning. The system includes the WalkieKnowledge benchmark for performance comparison.

Result: VL-KnG achieved a 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy in real-world robotic applications, matching advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro while offering enhanced reasoning and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VL-KnG provides a scalable, explainable navigation solution that surpasses existing VLM limitations, proving its feasibility for real-world deployment in complex tasks like planning and localization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal

modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity
over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph
structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5
Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the

TL;DR: The paper explores estimating the position and shape of a bioinspired, underactuated multi-link robot using unscented Kalman filters with enhanced residual learning. Experiments demonstrated accurate estimations with data-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable pose estimation for a bioinspired robot with minimal actuation and sensing, enabling efficient state estimation even under noise and with limited data.

Method: Reliably estimate robot pose using an unscented Kalman filter augmented by Gaussian process residual learning, validating the approach through hardware experiments and offline analysis.

Result: The pose estimation was reliable, and training on diverse yet reduced datasets enabled comparable accuracy, revealing potential for generalized estimations across robot gaits.

Conclusion: The study reduced data requirements for training while maintaining reliable pose estimations for robots with minimal sensors, improving generalizability across various motion patterns.

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot navigation in complex, unknown environments is difficult due to limitations in existing methods, such as scalability issues in traditional sampling-based approaches and high data requirements in imitation learning-based methods.

Method: The approach employs a hierarchical structure: a high-level sparse graph for global connectivity and a low-level neural field-based planner solving Eikonal PDEs for local navigation. This physics-informed design mitigates spectral bias and fitting challenges.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates improved adaptability and precision in large-scale environments, outperforming previous navigation methods. Validation highlights potential for online exploration and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework resolves key issues in robot navigation by enabling smooth and accurate cost-to-go estimation. It advances scalable and precise solutions for complex, unknown environments.

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

### [389] [Real-time Multi-Plane Segmentation Based on GPU Accelerated High-Resolution 3D Voxel Mapping for Legged Robot Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01592)
*Shun Niijima,Ryoichi Tsuzaki,Noriaki Takasugi,Masaya Kinoshita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a real-time 3D multi-plane segmentation method using GPU-accelerated voxel mapping to aid legged robot locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planar mapping methods struggle with accuracy, temporal integration, and representation of complex 3D structures in real-time applications.

Method: The framework combines vertex-based connected component labeling, RANSAC-based plane detection, and convex hull techniques with GPU parallel computing to extract planar regions from high-resolution voxel maps.

Result: The method achieves over 30 Hz update rate with high accuracy (0.01 m resolution) for plane segmentation, supporting real-time robot locomotion.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust and efficient plane detection for legged robots, validated through experiments in simulation and on physical platforms, enhancing their locomotion capabilities.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

### [390] [MiniBEE: A New Form Factor for Compact Bimanual Dexterity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01603)
*Sharfin Islam,Zewen Chen,Zhanpeng He,Swapneel Bhatt,Andres Permuy,Brock Taylor,James Vickery,Pedro Piacenza,Cheng Zhang,Matei Ciocarlie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiniBEE, a compact bimanual system with reduced-degree-of-freedom arms designed for dexterous manipulation while being lightweight and wearable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bimanual manipulators with high DOFs increase system complexity and underutilize workspace for dexterous interaction.

Method: The authors designed MiniBEE using kinematic dexterity metrics to optimize workspace and lightness, with complementary modes for wearable data collection and robotic arm integration.

Result: MiniBEE enables wearable demonstrations and real-world bimanual manipulation policies through kinematic analysis, design optimization, and imitation learning.

Conclusion: This novel system provides effective, lightweight dexterous manipulation with broad applications, simplifying traditional frameworks.

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

*Qiyuan Zeng,Chengmeng Li,Jude St. John,Zhongyi Zhou,Junjie Wen,Guorui Feng,Yichen Zhu,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveUMI is a novel framework for collecting human demonstrations in real-world environments to train robots for bimanual manipulation tasks using VR teleoperation kits and sensorized controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to create a scalable and effective system for training robots capable of complex bimanual manipulation in real-world environments by leveraging human demonstrations and active perception.

Method: The framework uses a VR teleoperation kit with sensorized controllers, immersive 3D rendering, wearable computers, and efficient calibration to transfer human demonstrations to robots. It records egocentric perception to link visual attention with manipulation.

Result: ActiveUMI-trained policies achieved an average success rate of 70% on in-distribution tasks and maintained a 56% success rate on novel objects and environments, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Portable data collection systems integrated with learned active perception provide a scalable and effective pathway for developing generalizable and proficient real-world robot policies.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual
manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized
controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot
kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a
self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods.
ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

### [392] [FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642)
*Zijun Lin,Jiafei Duan,Haoquan Fang,Dieter Fox,Ranjay Krishna,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents FailSafe, a system designed to help Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models handle robotic manipulation failures by providing executable recovery actions and failure cases, achieving substantial performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in VLA models for robotic manipulation, existing datasets do not address failures effectively. The lack of recovery mechanisms and utilizable failure explanations in models hinders robots in handling abrupt, unpredictable failures.

Method: FailSafe, a system for generating diverse robotic failure cases and paired executable recovery actions, is introduced. It is tested by fine-tuning the LLaVa-OneVision-7B model, producing FailSafe-VLM, and evaluating it on various tasks.

Result: FailSafe-VLM significantly enhanced failure detection and recovery capabilities, improving performance of state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on Maniskill tasks. It demonstrated generalizability across configurations.

Conclusion: FailSafe offers a scalable, simulation-agnostic solution to generating failure recovery data, enhancing robotic manipulation success rates and aiding in generalizing failure recovery strategies for VLA models. The approach will be shared publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

### [393] [Statistical Uncertainty Learning for Robust Visual-Inertial State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01648)
*Seungwon Choi,Donggyu Park,Seo-Yeon Hwang,Tae-Wan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach to dynamically assess sensor measurement reliability for visual-inertial odometry (VIO), improving tracking accuracy via an adaptive statistical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust VIO systems face challenges in accurately accounting for the dynamic uncertainties in sensor data, which traditional methods oversimplify using fixed uncertainty assumptions.

Method: The paper proposes a self-supervised statistical framework that infers measurement reliability online, leveraging multi-view geometric consistency to adaptively weight sensor measurements during optimization.

Result: The method showed significant improvements with reductions of 24% in translation error and 42% in rotation error on the EuRoC dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances real-time tracking accuracy and robustness in VIO, offering a practical solution with publicly released source code for further research.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

### [394] [Symskill: Symbol and Skill Co-Invention for Data-Efficient and Real-Time Long-Horizon Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01661)
*Yifei Simon Shao,Yuchen Zheng,Sunan Sun,Pratik Chaudhari,Vijay Kumar,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SymSkill, a framework that combines imitation learning (IL) and task-and-motion planning (TAMP) to achieve compositional generalization and real-time failure recovery in multi-step robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing IL and TAMP methods: IL lacks compositional generalization, and TAMP has high planning latency.

Method: SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills from unlabeled demonstrations offline. During execution, it uses a symbolic planner to compose and reorder learned skills for specified goals, with real-time recovery mechanisms.

Result: In simulations, SymSkill achieves an 85% success rate for 12 single-step tasks and composes up to 6-step plans, recovering from failures. On a real robot, it performs tasks based on goals using only 5 minutes of demonstration data.

Conclusion: SymSkill successfully integrates IL and TAMP benefits, enabling dynamic, compositional task execution and real-time recovery. It shows promise for practical robotic applications.

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

### [395] [Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01675)
*Jaewoo Lee,Dongjae Lee,Jinwoo Lee,Hyungyu Lee,Yeonjoon Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust geometric backstepping controller for variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotors that considers servo and rotor dynamics, outperforming traditional approaches across challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the stability and reliability of flight control for variable-tilt multirotors during aggressive maneuvers and recovery scenarios by accounting for the nonlinear actuator dynamics.

Method: A geometric backstepping controller was designed utilizing the cascade structure of rigid-body and nonlinear actuator dynamics. Its robustness against parametric uncertainty was validated experimentally.

Result: The experiments showed that the proposed controller had superior tracking performance compared to a baseline method, preventing crashes during challenging maneuvers such as fast translational tracking and recovery from sudden disturbances.

Conclusion: By explicitly accounting for actuator dynamics, the proposed controller enhances stability, robustness, and tracking performance, demonstrating significant improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolySim, a training platform that uses multiple simulators to minimize the sim-to-real gap in humanoid whole-body control policies with significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid whole-body control policies trained in simulation often fail due to the sim-to-real gap caused by simulator inductive bias—discrepancies arising from the assumptions and limitations of individual simulators.

Method: The approach involves training policies across multiple heterogeneous simulators simultaneously using PolySim, enabling dynamics-level domain randomization and reducing simulator-specific biases.

Result: PolySim significantly reduces motion-tracking errors in sim-to-sim environments, achieving a 52.8% improvement on MuJoCo compared to an IsaacSim baseline. It also enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1 robot without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PolySim proves effective in bridging the sim-to-real gap by leveraging multiple simulators and will make its code publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

TL;DR: Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL) enhances Vision-Language-Action models by aligning their representations with robotic proprioceptive states, significantly improving robot manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of Vision-Language-Action models, which lack sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states.

Method: The method introduces RS-CL, a representation regularization technique that aligns model representations with robot proprioceptive states using relative distances as soft supervision. RS-CL complements action prediction objectives and integrates seamlessly with VLA training pipelines.

Result: RS-CL achieves notable improvements in robot manipulation tasks, including a performance boost from 30.8% to 41.5% on RoboCasa-Kitchen pick-and-place tasks and success rate improvements from 45.0% to 58.3% on real-robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: RS-CL enhances control-relevant representation learning, is lightweight, and effectively bridges the gap between pre-trained Vision-Language Models and robotic signals, making it highly impactful for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: Magnetic continuum robots with radially embedded magnets in catheter walls achieve bending, torsion, and drug delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capabilities of minimally invasive magnetic robots for complex anatomical navigation and precise therapeutic delivery.

Method: Utilizing radially embedded magnets in catheter walls combined with physics-based modeling, finite-element analysis, and benchtop experiments to validate and optimize deformation controls.

Result: Successfully executed independent bending/torsion motion, validated decoupled actuation control, dual-layer drug release mechanism, and demonstrated end-to-end operation in phantom experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed magnetic continuum robot offers versatile deformation and precise payload delivery, showing strong potential for site-specific therapies in medical applications.

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of embedding manufacturing processes into smart factories with hundreds of machines by presenting TS-ACES, a scalable solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to solving the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem are limited to factories with a relatively small number of machines, whereas modern factories often operate with hundreds of interconnected machines.

Method: The authors introduce TS-ACES, a Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver intended to provide a more scalable and complete solution to the SFE problem.

Result: TS-ACES demonstrates scalability to industrial-scale factories with over a hundred machines and ensures completeness for embedding manufacturing procedures.

Conclusion: TS-ACES significantly improves the scalability of SFE solutions, effectively addressing challenges faced in real-world smart factory scenarios and enhancing industrial automation potential.

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Nav-EE is a navigation-guided early-exit framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in autonomous driving, reducing inference latency by over 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of high inference latency in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a key challenge for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Method: The authors propose Nav-EE, a framework that uses navigation foresight to precompute task-specific exit layers offline and apply them dynamically online for efficient inference.

Result: Nav-EE achieves comparable accuracy to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9% on autonomous driving datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in real-vehicle integration.

Conclusion: The study highlights that combining navigation guidance with early-exit techniques enables efficient and faster deployment of large models in autonomous systems, paving the way for improved real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper conducts a large-scale study of RL-based ObjectNav systems, focusing on perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. It finds perception quality and test-time strategies to be key performance drivers while policy improvements are less impactful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots often struggle with navigating uncontrolled everyday environments. This paper analyzes key factors to improve ObjectNav performance and provides insights to guide future developments.

Method: The authors perform extensive controlled experiments to study modular RL-based ObjectNav systems, isolating contributions of perception, policy, and test-time strategies.

Result: The study identified that perception quality and test-time enhancements are the decisive contributors to ObjectNav performance. The resulting system surpasses SotA benchmarks with a 6.6% SPL increase and 2.7% higher success rate.

Conclusion: The paper establishes new SotA benchmarks for ObjectNav, provides practical design guidelines, and highlights the gap between RL agents and human-level navigation, offering guidance for future research.

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Result: Optimized trajectories mimic human kicking with efficient planning (<1 ms) and nearly 100% accuracy in a -90° to 90° soccer goal range.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances task execution reliability and human-like kicking in humanoid robots.

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

*Diram Tabaa,Gianni Di Caro*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GreenhouseSplat introduces a framework for photorealistic greenhouse simulation using radiance field methods, enabling enhanced evaluation of agricultural robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing greenhouse simulations rely on simplistic assets that hinder simulation-to-reality transitions, requiring photorealistic environments for better robotic evaluations.

Method: The framework uses radiance-field methods, particularly Gaussian splatting, to generate realistic greenhouse assets from RGB images, which are then integrated into simulations compatible with ROS.

Result: The dataset includes 82 cucumber plants in various configurations, demonstrating improved utility for tasks like localization and robotics evaluation.

Conclusion: GreenhouseSplat provides a pivotal step toward realistic, radiance-field-based greenhouse simulations, advancing research in agricultural robotics.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

*Alessandro Nazzari,Roberto Rubinacci,Marco Lovera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACOS, a framework for enabling single pilots to control multi-drone systems via natural language using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to reduce pilot workload and enable flexible interaction in multi-drone systems by leveraging advancements in language models for reasoning and planning.

Method: The TACOS framework includes three key components: (1) a natural language interface for user interaction, (2) an intelligent coordinator to convert user intents to structured task plans, and (3) an autonomous agent responsible for plan execution in real-world scenarios.

Result: The authors demonstrate TACOS in real-world multi-drone operations and perform an ablation study to evaluate the impact of its components.

Conclusion: TACOS successfully bridges semantic reasoning through LLMs and practical real-time multi-drone coordination, offering an intuitive and functional solution for managing such systems.

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARC is a compact and open-source 3-DoF spine module for quadruped robots, enabling programmable compliance and advanced control in a lightweight design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a lightweight, compact, and programmable spine module for quadruped robots that integrates revolute and prismatic motions with tunable task-space impedance.

Method: The SPARC system incorporates torque-controlled actuators, a custom control board, and a power unit to create a 1.26 kg module. It uses an RNEA-based computed-acceleration controller with friction compensation to render spring-damper behavior for stiffness and damping shaping.

Result: Bench and dynamic tests validate SPARC's stability and performance. It achieves accurate, linear force-displacement characteristics and mass-spring-damper behavior with minimal errors.

Conclusion: SPARC is a reliable and portable spine module that facilitates studies of spine compliance in quadruped locomotion. It will be released with accessible hardware and firmware resources.

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

*Lingxiang Hu,Naima Ait Oufroukh,Fabien Bonardi,Raymond Ghandour*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The EC3R-SLAM framework addresses issues in monocular dense SLAM by introducing a calibration-free, efficient, and accurate SLAM system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular dense SLAM systems face challenges like high latency, large GPU memory usage, and the need for camera calibration, which limit their practical applicability.

Method: The paper introduces EC3R-SLAM, a framework combining a sparse feature-based tracking module with a 3D reconstruction model that estimates camera intrinsics, and integrates local and global loop closures for consistency.

Result: EC3R-SLAM demonstrates competitive accuracy and robustness relative to state-of-the-art methods, while being faster, memory-efficient, and operable on low-resource hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the efficiency and applicability of monocular dense SLAM, showing promise for real-world robotics applications even in constrained environments.

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LangGrasp integrates large language models with a point cloud localization module to enable robots to deduce implicit intents and perform high-precision grasping operations at both object and part levels in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with ambiguous language instructions, particularly implicit intents, in robotic grasping tasks.

Method: LangGrasp uses fine-tuned large language models for interpreting ambiguous instructions and a point cloud localization module for precise part-level manipulation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate LangGrasp’s ability to resolve ambiguous instructions, identify critical unstated operations, and enhance task execution efficiency with dynamic pose selection.

Conclusion: LangGrasp improves robotic adaptability and precision in unstructured environments by integrating language comprehension and fine-grained grasping capabilities.

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

*Philip Reichenberg,Tim Laue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces improved stand-up motions for the NAO humanoid robot to enhance performance by addressing joint errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from improving the self-recovery ability of humanoid robots, especially during soccer games, to prevent being sidelined.

Method: The paper focused on refining stand-up motions by addressing large joint errors and incorporating special motions to free stuck limbs or compensate with other joints.

Result: The improved stand-up motions significantly increased success rates and were adopted by multiple teams in the Standard Platform League to achieve similar outcomes.

Conclusion: The refined motions are both effective and replicable, contributing to better performance and utility in humanoid robot soccer games.

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

TL;DR: The paper presents the SCANS system, a soft robot that uses spectroscopy to differentiate materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from enhancing spectral sensing capabilities in soft robots for object classification.

Method: A fluidically actuated soft manipulator system was designed for spectral sensing in pre-touch and in-hand scenarios.

Result: The system achieves reliable material classification across multiple object types and highlights the importance of near-infrared sensitivity.

Conclusion: SCANS advances optical sensing in soft robotics, offering accessible resources for replication and further development.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and
processing code for the SCANS gripper are accessible at:

*Sara Strakosova,Petr Novak,Petr Kadera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores using digital twin technology to optimize the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries for a circular economy approach, aiming to enhance sustainability and reduce environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of manufacturer support for data sharing, which hinders efficient remanufacturing and recycling processes essential for sustainability.

Method: The study proposes a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN), extending digital twin technology to include both manufacturing and recycling/remanufacturing stages.

Result: The digital twin approach, demonstrated through an electric vehicle battery use case, enables flexible and efficient adaptation to various battery disassembly challenges while improving ecological outcomes.

Conclusion: Integrating digital twin technology via Bi-PAN supports the circular economy by facilitating seamless manufacturing and end-of-life disassembly processes, promoting sustainability.

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DisCo-Layout, a framework for generating better 3D indoor layouts by addressing both semantic and physical refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D indoor layouts struggle with generalization and refinement, leading to less optimal designs.

Method: DisCo-Layout separates and coordinates semantic and physical refinement using specialized tools (SRT and PRT) and a multi-agent framework for collaborative refinement.

Result: DisCo-Layout outperforms existing methods, producing realistic and generalizable 3D layouts.

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout effectively improves 3D indoor layout synthesis and will offer its code publicly for broader use.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

*Yan Miao,Ege Yuceel,Georgios Fainekos,Bardh Hoxha,Hideki Okamoto,Sayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FalconGym 2.0, a photorealistic simulation framework for aerial navigation, and a Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm that improves visual policies' robustness and generalization to new tracks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art visual policies for aerial navigation often suffer from overfitting to single tracks, making them less effective when the track geometry changes. Thus, there is a need to improve their capability to generalize across diverse environments and handle real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors developed FalconGym 2.0, a simulation platform built on Gaussian Splatting with an Edit API for rapid track generation, coupled with the Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm. PGR focuses training on challenging tracks to iteratively enhance policy performance.

Result: Experiments on two different UAV platforms and environments showed that policies trained using PGR achieved 100% generalization success across unseen tracks without requiring per-track retraining. These policies also proved robust under perturbations and were successfully sim-to-real transferred with high success on quadrotor hardware.

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0 and the PGR algorithm together enable the creation of robust, generalizable visual policies for aerial navigation. These developments significantly improve zero-shot transferability to real-world scenarios, as demonstrated by high success rates in hardware trials.

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

*Joao Pedro Araujo,Yanjie Ze,Pei Xu,Jiajun Wu,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of human motion retargeting quality on humanoid robot motion tracking policies and introduces a new method, General Motion Retargeting (GMR), to improve robustness and fidelity over existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study arises from the need to address the embodiment gap between human motion data and humanoid robot forms in teleoperation pipelines and hierarchical control systems.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate the quality of retargeting methods on motion tracking policies without excessive reward tuning. They propose GMR, a new retargeting technique, and assess its performance against open-source and closed-source methods using the LAFAN1 dataset.

Result: Experiments revealed that artifacts in retargeted motion data adversely affect policy robustness, especially for dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently delivers better tracking performance and alignment with human motion compared to open-source alternatives, nearing the performance of high-quality closed-source methods.

Conclusion: GMR significantly improves motion tracking fidelity and robustness over existing retargeting methods, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between human and humanoid robot motion in teleoperation scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance view-invariant imitation learning by conditioning policies on camera extrinsics using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays. This improves generalization across viewpoints and robustness under viewpoint shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizing imitation learning policies across varying camera viewpoints and eliminating reliance on static background cues.

Method: The authors integrate camera extrinsics into policies using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays and assess model performance in manipulation tasks with varied scene setups.

Result: Conditioning policies on camera extrinsics significantly improves generalization capabilities and robustness in viewpoint-shift scenarios while eliminating reliance on static background cues.

Conclusion: Including camera extrinsics strengthens policy robustness and enables effective RGB-only control without requiring depth information, demonstrating potential for more adaptable imitation learning systems.

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARMADA, a system to improve imitation learning using shared human-robot control with an autonomous failure detection method (FLOAT). It reduces human supervision and increases adaptability in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of pretrained policies in imitation learning, such as poor performance without in-domain data and the need for labor-intensive, mixed-quality human demonstrations.

Method: The authors developed ARMADA, a system combining multi-robot deployment, shared human-in-the-loop control, and the FLOAT method for autonomous failure detection. FLOAT minimizes human supervision by detecting failures during policy rollout and prompting human guidance only when necessary.

Result: ARMADA exhibited significantly improved performance, including nearly 95% accuracy for FLOAT (20% improvement over prior methods) and a 4x increase in task success rate and over 2x reduction in human intervention rate compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: ARMADA enables scalable deployment and faster adaptation in imitation learning with reduced reliance on human intervention.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

*Huashan Chen,Zhenyu Qi,Haotang Li,Hong Chen,Jinfu Chen,Kebin Peng,In Kee Kim,Kyu Hyung Lee,Sen He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PerfOrch, a multistage framework that dynamically utilizes the strengths of different LLMs for coding tasks, achieving higher correctness and performance than single-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-model approaches for automated code generation fail to account for the differing computational strengths of LLMs across programming languages and problem domains.

Method: The paper evaluates 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across 5 programming languages using a benchmark and proposes PerfOrch, which dynamically routes tasks to the best LLMs based on performance, using validation and rollback mechanisms.

Result: PerfOrch improves functional correctness rates to 96.22% and 91.37% on benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o's rates of 78.66% and 49.11%, while also optimizing execution times for a majority of problems.

Conclusion: PerfOrch demonstrates the viability of a multi-LLM orchestration framework for automated software engineering, achieving better scalability, correctness, and runtime performance without requiring fine-tuning of individual models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for
automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore
the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across
programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper
challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage,
performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks
to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our
approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art
LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using
HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness
and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization,
and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language,
development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we
present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each
task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without
requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over
strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37%
on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and
49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance
optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median
speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The
framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing
new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm
for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly
evolving generative AI landscape.

### [417] [Deciphering WONTFIX: A Mixed-Method Study on Why GitHub Issues Get Rejected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01514)
*J. Alexander Curtis,Sharadha Kasiviswanathan,Nasir Eisty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the prevalence and reasons for the "wontfix" label on GitHub issues, analyzing its impact on project management and open-source community dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of understanding surrounding the "wontfix" label, which is used frequently yet remains unclear in its implications for resource management and contributor dynamics in open-source projects.

Method: The paper employs a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative analysis of repository data and qualitative thematic analysis to uncover reasons behind the application of the "wontfix" label. Data were gathered from 3,132 popular GitHub repositories.

Result: The study found that 30% of GitHub projects utilize the "wontfix" label, primarily for user-submitted bug reports and feature requests. Eight common themes were identified for its usage, including user-specific and maintainer-specific reasons.

Conclusion: The "wontfix" label is a valuable tool for resource management but can deter contributor engagement and hinder project transparency. Better understanding helps project managers optimize collaboration in open-source communities.

Abstract: Context: The ``wontfix'' label is a widely used yet narrowly understood tool
in GitHub repositories, indicating that an issue will not be pursued further.
Despite its prevalence, the impact of this label on project management and
community dynamics within open-source software development is not clearly
defined. Objective: This study examines the prevalence and reasons behind
issues being labeled as wontfix across various open-source repositories on
GitHub. Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, we analyze both quantitative
data to assess the prevalence of the wontfix label and qualitative data to
explore the reasoning that it was used. Data were collected from 3,132 of
GitHub's most-popular repositories. Later, we employ open coding and thematic
analysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a
structured understanding of the issue management landscape. Results: Our
findings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the wontfix label to
some issues. These issues most often occur on user-submitted issues for bug
reports and feature requests. The study identified eight common themes behind
labeling issues as wontfix, ranging from user-specific control factors to
maintainer-specific decisions. Conclusions: The wontfix label is a critical
tool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects.
However, it can also discourage community involvement and obscure the
transparency of project management. Understanding these reasons aids project
managers in making informed decisions and fostering efficient collaboration
within open-source communities.

### [418] [MIMIC: Integrating Diverse Personality Traits for Better Game Testing Using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01635)
*Yifei Chen,Sarra Habchi,Lili Wei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIMIC, a framework that incorporates diverse personality traits in gaming agents to enable varied playstyles, improving game testing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game testing faces challenges due to the inability of automated agents to mimic the diversity of strategies used by human players. This leads to limited test coverage and reduced discovery of edge cases.

Method: The paper proposes MIMIC, a framework that integrates diverse personality traits into gaming agents, enabling multiple playstyles for the same situations. This approach leverages the diversity inherent in human gaming strategies.

Result: MIMIC achieves higher task completion rates and generates more diverse solutions compared to state-of-the-art gaming agents, particularly demonstrated in Minecraft.

Conclusion: MIMIC showcases significant potential for improving automated game testing by enhancing test coverage and generating richer in-game interactions through diverse, human-like play strategies.

Abstract: Modern video games pose significant challenges for traditional automated
testing algorithms, yet intensive testing is crucial to ensure game quality. To
address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using
Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However,
these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due
to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar
situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle
to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases.
  In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse
personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming
strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can
achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different
games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a
higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results
highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.

### [419] [FOSS-chain: using blockchain for Open Source Software license compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01740)
*Kypros Iacovou,Georgia M. Kapitsaki,Evangelia Vanezi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a blockchain-integrated platform, FOSS-chain, to automate license compliance for OSS projects, helping address compatibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSS license compliance can be challenging due to incompatibilities, risking legal disputes. Blockchain offers immutable transparency, motivating its integration for license management.

Method: The authors designed, implemented, and evaluated FOSS-chain, a web platform leveraging blockchain to track software adaptations and address OSS license compliance for 14 licenses.

Result: A small-scale user study on the FOSS-chain prototype showed promising results, indicating potential for real-world application.

Conclusion: FOSS-chain demonstrates feasibility for integrating blockchain technology with OSS license management, suggesting its usefulness for handling license compatibility issues.

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) is widely used and carries licenses that indicate
the terms under which the software is provided for use, also specifying
modification and distribution rules. Ensuring that users are respecting OSS
license terms when creating derivative works is a complex process. Compliance
issues arising from incompatibilities among licenses may lead to legal
disputes. At the same time, the blockchain technology with immutable entries
offers a mechanism to provide transparency when it comes to licensing and
ensure software changes are recorded. In this work, we are introducing an
integration of blockchain and license management when creating derivative
works, in order to tackle the issue of OSS license compatibility. We have
designed, implemented and performed a preliminary evaluation of FOSS-chain, a
web platform that uses blockchain and automates the license compliance process,
covering 14 OSS licenses. We have evaluated the initial prototype version of
the FOSS-chain platform via a small scale user study. Our preliminary results
are promising, demonstrating the potential of the platform for adaptation on
realistic software systems.

### [420] [ARENA: A tool for measuring and analysing the energy efficiency of Android apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01754)
*Hina Anwar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ARENA is a tool for measuring Android app energy consumption via hardware devices, integrated into development environments like IntelliJ and Android Studio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for easier and reliable hardware-based tools to measure the energy consumption of Android apps, as current methods are time-consuming, hard to adapt, and lack open-source availability.

Method: ARENA is developed as a plugin for IntelliJ and Android Studio to facilitate measuring, aggregating, analyzing, reporting, and visualizing energy usage data by connecting to physical measurement devices.

Result: ARENA allows developers to compare the energy consumption of apps or app versions during development, using test scenarios to calculate energy consumption on Android devices.

Conclusion: ARENA simplifies hardware-based energy measurement for Android apps by integrating it into the development process, thereby aiding developers and researchers in optimizing energy efficiency.

Abstract: To build energy-efficient apps, there is a need to estimate and analyze their
energy consumption in typical usage scenarios. The energy consumption of
Android apps could be estimated via software-based and hardware-based
approaches. Software-based approaches, while easier to implement, are not as
accurate as hardware-based approaches. The process of measuring the energy
consumption of an Android app via a hardware-based approach typically involves
1) setting up a measurement environment, 2) executing the app under test on a
mobile device, 3) recording current/voltage data via a hardware device to
measure energy consumption, and 4) cleaning and aggregating data for analyses,
reports, and visualizations. Specialized scripts are written for selected
hardware and software components to ensure reliable energy measurements. The
energy measurement process is repeated many times and aggregated to remove
noise. These steps make the hardware-based energy measurement process
time-consuming and not easy to adapt or reproduce. There is a lack of
open-source tools available for developers and researchers to take reliable
energy measurements via hardware devices. In this paper, we present and
demonstrate ARENA, a support tool that enables developers and researchers to
connect to a physical measurement device without leaving the comfort of their
IDE. Developers could use ARENA during development to compare energy
consumption between different apps or versions of the same app. ARENA
calculates energy consumption on an Android smartphone by executing a test
scenario on the app under development. Further, ARENA helps aggregate,
statistically analyze, report, and visualize the data, allowing developers and
researchers to dig into the data directly or visually. We implemented ARENA as
an IntelliJ and Android Studio plugin.

### [421] [Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825)
*Zhenyu Yang,Yue Pan,Zhen Yang,Zhongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NARRepair introduces a non-autoregressive approach for automatic program repair (APR) to improve repair speed without compromising patch quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR-based APR approaches are slow due to their token-by-token prediction nature, leading to latency issues, especially in models with large parameters.

Method: Proposed NARRepair, a NAR-based model featuring three novelties: a repair action predictor to reduce over-correction, an inter-token dependency extractor to maintain token relationships, and a two-stage decoder for contextual understanding.

Result: NARRepair was evaluated on three standard APR datasets, demonstrating faster repair speeds (1.4-6.4x improvement) and state-of-the-art repair accuracy compared to AR-based methods.

Conclusion: NARRepair outperforms prior APR techniques by combining speed and accuracy, offering a significant step forward in practical and efficient code repair.

Abstract: Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various
application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on
automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous
machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the
autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.
Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has
a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large
number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the
non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code
in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the
NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch
quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper
propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR
task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the
repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the
inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking
inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for
alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair
on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that
1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best
performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR
techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times
in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved
state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and
accuracy.

### [422] [RefFilter: Improving Semantic Conflict Detection via Refactoring-Aware Static Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01960)
*Victor Lira,Paulo Borba,Rodrigo Bonifácio,Galileu Santos e Matheus barbosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RefFilter is a tool designed to detect semantic interference in collaborative software by filtering out behavior-preserving code refactorings, significantly reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static analysis techniques for detecting semantic interference in collaborative software struggle with high false positive rates due to behavior-preserving code refactorings.

Method: RefFilter incorporates automated refactoring detection into static analysis techniques to identify and exclude behavior-preserving code refactorings from interference reports.

Result: RefFilter achieved a 32% reduction in false positives on a labeled dataset of 99 scenarios and maintained effective detection coverage with minimal increase in false negatives.

Conclusion: Refactoring-aware interference detection improves merge support in modern development workflows by significantly enhancing precision while maintaining recall.

Abstract: Detecting semantic interference remains a challenge in collaborative software
development. Recent lightweight static analysis techniques improve efficiency
over SDG-based methods, but they still suffer from a high rate of false
positives. A key cause of these false positives is the presence of
behavior-preserving code refactorings, which current techniques cannot
effectively distinguish from changes that impact behavior and can interfere
with others. To handle this problem we present RefFilter, a refactoring-aware
tool for semantic interference detection. It builds on existing static
techniques by incorporating automated refactoring detection to improve
precision. RefFilter discards behavior-preserving refactorings from reports,
reducing false positives while preserving detection coverage. To evaluate
effectiveness and scalability, use two datasets: a labeled dataset with 99
scenarios and ground truth, and a novel dataset of 1,087 diverse merge
scenarios that we have built. Experimental results show that RefFilter reduces
false positives by nearly 32% on the labeled dataset. While this reduction
comes with a non significant increase in false negatives, the overall gain in
precision significantly outweighs the minor trade-off in recall. These findings
demonstrate that refactoring-aware interference detection is a practical and
effective strategy for improving merge support in modern development workflows.

### [423] [Clarifying Semantics of In-Context Examples for Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01994)
*Chen Yang,Lin Yang,Ziqi Wang,Dong Wang,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAST, a new technique to improve the clarity and effectiveness of unit tests used in large language model (LLM) in-context learning scenarios. CLAST shows superior results in test clarity and generation performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating unit tests using LLMs frequently suffer from suboptimal results due to unclear or poorly structured in-context examples.

Method: CLAST systematically refines unit tests by breaking down complex tests into more logical components, improving semantic clarity through program analysis and LLM-enhanced rewriting.

Result: Compared to the prior method UTgen, CLAST outperforms in preserving unit test effectiveness (compilation success rate, pass rate, test coverage, and mutation score), and significantly enhances unit test clarity and utility, as supported by user study preferences and improved downstream performance in test generation.

Conclusion: CLAST offers a highly effective solution for refining unit tests, improving their clarity and use in LLM-based test generation methods, and sets the stage for further advancements in software testing practices.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising
performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However,
the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness
of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples
often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel
technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic
clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach
decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic
clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We
evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results
demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art
refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing
semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness
of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate
(PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%,
35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user
study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably,
incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based
unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an
average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for
generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights
from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in
software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.

### [424] [Automatic Generation of Combinatorial Reoptimisation Problem Specifications: A Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02002)
*Maximilian Kratz,Steffen Zschaler,Jens Kosiol,Gabriele Taentzer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of reoptimizing solutions to optimization problems due to contextual changes, introducing Model-Driven Engineering for systematic derivation of reoptimization specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reoptimisation is necessary when contextual factors change after solving an optimisation problem, requiring minimal impact on the original solution.

Method: The paper employs Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) using declarative modelling languages and transformations to develop an approach for systematically deriving reoptimisation problems. A proof-of-concept implementation using the GIPS tool is provided.

Result: The initial categorisation of changing problems and strategies for reoptimisation is presented, along with an example application to resource allocation for teaching assistants using GIPS.

Conclusion: Model-Driven Engineering offers a promising pathway for systematically handling reoptimisation challenges, as demonstrated through the example and initial implementation.

Abstract: Once an optimisation problem has been solved, the solution may need
adaptation when contextual factors change. This challenge, also known as
reoptimisation, has been addressed in various problem domains, such as railway
crew rescheduling, nurse rerostering, or aircraft recovery. This requires a
modified problem to be solved again to ensure that the adapted solution is
optimal in the new context. However, the new optimisation problem differs
notably from the original problem: (i) we want to make only minimal changes to
the original solution to minimise the impact; (ii) we may be unable to change
some parts of the original solution (e.g., because they refer to past
allocations); and (iii) we need to derive a change script from the original
solution to the new solution. In this paper, we argue that Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) - in particular, the use of declarative modelling languages
and model transformations for the high-level specification of optimisation
problems - offers new opportunities for the systematic derivation of
reoptimisation problems from the original optimisation problem specification.
We focus on combinatorial reoptimisation problems and provide an initial
categorisation of changing problems and strategies for deriving the
corresponding reoptimisation specifications. We introduce an initial
proof-of-concept implementation based on the GIPS (Graph-Based (Mixed) Integer
Linear Programming Problem Specification) tool and apply it to an example
resource-allocation problem: the allocation of teaching assistants to teaching
sessions.

### [425] [ACM SIGSOFT SEN Empirical Software Engineering: Introducing Our New Regular Column](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02007)
*Justus Bogner,Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new ACM SIGSOFT SEN column for discussing meta-aspects of empirical software engineering (ESE) with the aim of improving the field and addressing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by challenges in ESE research, such as research reproducibility, limited external validity, subjective reviews, and bridging the gap between research and industrial practices.

Method: The column will feature contributions grounded in expert interviews, focus groups, surveys, and position pieces to cover meta-aspects like replication practices, statistical methods, and interdisciplinary research.

Result: The column aims to facilitate discussions on ESE practices, spark reflection, and create an evolving platform for continuous improvements in the field.

Conclusion: The new column invites the community's feedback and contributions to shape its content, aiming for active engagement and addressing the community's needs for better ESE methodologies and practices.

Abstract: From its early foundations in the 1970s, empirical software engineering (ESE)
has evolved into a mature research discipline that embraces a plethora of
different topics, methodologies, and industrial practices. Despite its
remarkable progress, the ESE research field still needs to keep evolving, as
new impediments, shortcoming, and technologies emerge. Research
reproducibility, limited external validity, subjectivity of reviews, and
porting research results to industrial practices are just some examples of the
drivers for improvements to ESE research. Additionally, several facets of ESE
research are not documented very explicitly, which makes it difficult for
newcomers to pick them up. With this new regular ACM SIGSOFT SEN column
(SEN-ESE), we introduce a venue for discussing meta-aspects of ESE research,
ranging from general topics such as the nature and best practices for
replication packages, to more nuanced themes such as statistical methods,
interview transcription tools, and publishing interdisciplinary research. Our
aim for the column is to be a place where we can regularly spark conversations
on ESE topics that might not often be touched upon or are left implicit.
Contributions to this column will be grounded in expert interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and position pieces, with the goal of encouraging reflection
and improvement in how we conduct, communicate, teach, and ultimately improve
ESE research. Finally, we invite feedback from the ESE community on
challenging, controversial, or underexplored topics, as well as suggestions for
voices you would like to hear from. While we cannot promise to act on every
idea, we aim to shape this column around the community interests and are
grateful for all contributions.

*Peter Wauyo,Dalia Bwiza,Alain Murara,Edwin Mugume,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal system for detecting public transport fraud using video and audio data, notably surpassing current benchmarks through an advanced fusion technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more accurate and comprehensive system for detecting and deterring fraud in public transportation using multimodal data.

Method: The study combines the ViViT model for video analysis, AST for audio processing, and Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) architecture for advanced cross-modal feature fusion.

Result: The system achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0%, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating notable gains in F1 score and recall via tensor fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective in real-time fraud detection, offering significant operational advantages for public transportation networks.

Abstract: This research introduces a multimodal system designed to detect fraud and
fare evasion in public transportation by analyzing closed circuit television
(CCTV) and audio data. The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for
Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram
Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion
Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal
interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique
captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g.,
tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds).
The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of
89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent
activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding
the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation
fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor
fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost
in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports
real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue
loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.

*Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji,El-hacen Diallo,Jordan Samhi,Kui Liu,Jacques Klein,Tegawendé F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current public code datasets lack systematic quality verification; SIEVE aims to address this with statistical confidence certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code agents and empirical software engineering require reliable datasets, but current datasets lack auditable quality guarantees, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The paper introduces SIEVE, a community-driven framework that converts per-property checks into machine-readable statistical Confidence Cards.

Result: SIEVE promises statistical bounds for dataset properties, providing verifiable quality assurance and facilitating lower quality-related costs.

Conclusion: Replacing narrative dataset cards with anytime-verifiable Confidence Cards can enhance trust in public code datasets while reducing associated costs.

Abstract: Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets,
yet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards'
inform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical
guarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build
isolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We
present SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into
Confidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid
statistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity,
replacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is
expected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.

*Vadim Safronov,Anthony McCaigue,Nicholas Allott,Andrew Martin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) to address the complexities in AI systems using extended SBOM principles for transparency and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) frameworks are insufficient for AI systems due to their dynamic, data-driven nature and fragmented governance.

Method: The TAIBOM framework incorporates a tailored dependency model for AI, integrity propagation across pipelines, and trust attestation for provenance verification.

Result: TAIBOM effectively supports assurance, security, and compliance in AI-enabled workflows, outperforming standards like SPDX and CycloneDX.

Conclusion: The proposed TAIBOM lays a foundation for creating trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through enhanced software transparency.

Abstract: The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies
has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain,
challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance.
While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing
transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the
unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven
nature and the loosely coupled dependencies across datasets, models, and
software components. These challenges are compounded by fragmented governance
structures and the lack of robust tools for ensuring integrity, trust, and
compliance in AI-enabled environments.
  In this paper, we introduce Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) -- a novel
framework extending SBOM principles to the AI domain. TAIBOM provides (i) a
structured dependency model tailored for AI components, (ii) mechanisms for
propagating integrity statements across heterogeneous AI pipelines, and (iii) a
trust attestation process for verifying component provenance. We demonstrate
how TAIBOM supports assurance, security, and compliance across AI workflows,
highlighting its advantages over existing standards such as SPDX and CycloneDX.
This work lays the foundation for trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through
structured software transparency.

### [429] [FalseCrashReducer: Mitigating False Positive Crashes in OSS-Fuzz-Gen Using Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02185)
*Paschal C. Amusuo,Dongge Liu,Ricardo Andres Calvo Mendez,Jonathan Metzman,Oliver Chang,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of false positive crashes in automated fuzz driver generation by introducing two AI-driven strategies: constraint-based driver generation and context-based crash validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzz testing is widely used for detecting software bugs, but the manual creation of fuzz drivers is resource-intensive, and automated methods often produce false positive crashes, undermining trust in large-scale industry efforts.

Method: The authors propose combining constraint-driven fuzz driver creation with context-based validation to ensure input correctness and verify crash feasibility. These methods leverage program analysis and large language models.

Result: Tests on 1,500 functions from OSS-Fuzz demonstrate these strategies reduce false positive crashes by up to 8%, cutting reported crashes by over half while utilizing advanced LLMs effectively.

Conclusion: AI techniques show potential in enhancing automated fuzzing processes, although challenges remain in scaling and reliability for industry benchmarks.

Abstract: Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs
and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and
open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,
which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target
function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz
drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models
to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers
frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly
structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially
crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as
reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system
and the team.
  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in
OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,
constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a
function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based
crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether
reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark
functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes
by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that
frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results
highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing
pipelines.

*Stefania Kaklamani,Constantinos Simserides*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines listener preferences for consonance and dissonance in dyads composed of sine tones, analyzing impacts of interval ratios and pitch range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pitch range and interval structure influence perceptions of consonance and dissonance, especially considering psychoacoustic factors.

Method: Participants rated sine tone dyads using binary 'like' or 'dislike' preferences. Statistical analysis categorized responses based on interval class and participant demographics.

Result: Preferences decreased with higher mean frequencies. Musicians favored certain intervals more than non-musicians, while gender and age influenced sensitivity to high frequencies.

Conclusion: Perception of consonance in simple tones is influenced by interval structure and pitch range, potentially due to psychoacoustic factors like frequency sensitivity.

Abstract: This study investigates how listeners perceive consonance and dissonance in
dyads composed of simple (sine) tones, focusing on the effects of frequency
ratio ($R$) and mean frequency ($F$). Seventy adult participants - categorized
by musical training, gender, and age group - rated randomly ordered dyads using
binary preference responses (``like'' or ``dislike''). Dyads represented
standard Western intervals but were constructed with sine tones rather than
musical notes, preserving interval ratios while varying absolute pitch.
Statistical analyses reveal a consistent decrease in preference with increasing
mean frequency, regardless of interval class or participant group. Octaves,
fifths, fourths, and sixths showed a nearly linear decline in preference with
increasing $F$. Major seconds were among the least preferred. Musicians rated
octaves and certain consonant intervals more positively than non-musicians,
while gender and age groups exhibited different sensitivity to high
frequencies. The findings suggest that both interval structure and pitch range
shape the perception of consonance in simple-tone dyads, with possible
psychoacoustic explanations involving frequency sensitivity and auditory
fatigue at higher frequencies.

*Lindsey Knowles,Cesar Ceballos,Rodrigo Pena*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study identifies two neuronal operational modes, coincidence detection and integration, which are elucidated with a simplified polynomial model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neural coding properties by analyzing neuronal operational modes under varying degrees of stimulation.

Method: The paper uses in vivo stimulation and derives a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients to describe subthreshold dynamics for two neuronal modes of operation.

Result: The model shows that transitions between modes can be explained by the sign and size of specific nonlinear coefficients.

Conclusion: Defining neuronal operational modes contributes to comprehending neural information processing and might help in explaining disorders involving electrophysiological dysfunctions like channelopathies.

Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes
that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to
elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving in vivo stimulation, we
show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the
coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a
simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients betam that captures
the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can
explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear
coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes
provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through
electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal
functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological
behavior, such as channelopathies.

### [432] [Aligning Video Models with Human Social Judgments via Behavior-Guided Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01502)
*Kathy Garcia,Leyla Isik*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper addresses whether modern AI models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos and proposes methods to improve alignment with human perceptions, revealing a modality gap and showing successful fine-tuning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether AI models can intuitively perceive human-like social signals and bridging the gap between human and model understanding of social video similarity.

Method: The authors benchmark human-perceived social video similarity judgments, identify a gap between pretrained video and caption-based embeddings, and introduce a fine-tuning protocol (hybrid triplet-RSA objective with LoRA) to align AI models with human social perceptions.

Result: Fine-tuned video models significantly improve alignment with human similarity judgments, increase shared variance with language models, and encode social-affective attributes more effectively compared to the pretrained baseline.

Conclusion: Behavior-guided fine-tuning improves video models' alignment with human social perception, highlighting critical gaps in the social recognition abilities of pretrained video models.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it
remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity
structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture
human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this
structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we
introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on
250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality
gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align
better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap
by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our
novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning
pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields
significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in
terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance
partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance
with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured
by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find
that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective
attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the
pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video
models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning
shapes video representations toward human social perception.

*Sangjoon J. Kim,Vicky Chan,Niko Fullmer,Emily R. Rosario,Christine Kim,Charles Y. Liu,Marti Comellas,Daniel K. Zondervan,David J. Reinkensmeyer,An H. Do*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examined the effectiveness of Boost, a wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device, in assisting upper extremity motor recovery in stroke patients. Results showed a potential trend of improvement for less severely impaired individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke patients often face chronic upper extremity impairment, necessitating innovative rehabilitation tools to promote motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation.

Method: 35 stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional upper extremity exercises using either Boost or a therapist-customized self-practice booklet, with outcomes evaluated through multiple motor recovery tests.

Result: Boost users achieved thousands of additional arm movements and showed a trend towards greater UEFM improvement post-intervention, especially in patients with less severe baseline impairment. No significant differences were found at a three-month follow-up.

Conclusion: Boost-assisted therapy demonstrates feasibility, short-term benefits, and tolerance during subacute rehabilitation, particularly for certain subgroups. Larger trials are required to confirm its efficacy and determine optimal usage parameters.

Abstract: Chronic upper extremity (UE) impairment is common after stroke. This study
evaluated Boost, a novel wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device designed to
assist individuals in UE motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation.
Thirty-five stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional UE
exercises alongside standard therapy, using either Boost or a
therapist-customized booklet for self-practice. Outcomes included the UE
Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) Exam, Box and Block Test, Motor Activity Log, Modified
Ashworth Scale, shoulder subluxation, and shoulder pain. At baseline, mean days
post-stroke were 11.9$\pm$4.6 and 13.1$\pm$5.9, and UEFM scores were
20.5$\pm$10.1 and 21.0$\pm$13.5. Intervention durations averaged 11.9$\pm$4.0
and 17.2$\pm$8.8 days, respectively. Participants in the Boost group completed
3,359$\pm$3,137 additional arm movements. No significant between-group
differences were found at the three-month follow-up. However, the Boost group
showed a trend toward greater UEFM improvement immediately post-intervention
(11.8 vs. 6.9 points, p=0.06). Importantly, UEFM gains were predicted by the
number of Boost exercises performed (p=0.02, R-square=0.34). Subgroup analysis
revealed that patients with less severe impairment (baseline UEFM >21) achieved
significantly greater UEFM improvements at discharge with Boost compared to
controls (15.8 vs. 7.8 points, p=0.01). These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of achieving thousands of additional UE practice movements while
seated in a wheelchair without direct supervision during subacute
rehabilitation. The added movement practice was well tolerated and may offer
short-term impairment-reduction benefits, particularly in those with less
severe impairment. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy, establish
optimal dosage, and determine long-term clinical and functional benefits of
Boost-assisted therapy.

### [434] [A Modular Theory of Subjective Consciousness for Natural and Artificial Minds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01864)
*Michaël Gillon*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT), which provides a computational framework where consciousness is defined as discrete Integrated Informational States influenced by modular information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how subjective experience arises from information processing and addresses this challenge through a biologically grounded and computational framework.

Method: It proposes the Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) involving the processing of inputs by specific functional modules and the generation of Integrated Informational States tagged with density vectors that relate to subjective intensity.

Result: MCT offers a detailed computational approach that explains the influence of strongly tagged informational states on memory and behavior, with predictions like stress-enhancing memory encoding.

Conclusion: The theory conceptualizes consciousness as a quantifiable, evolvable feature of complex information processing rather than an irreducible essence, and it provides a blueprint for biological and artificial cognition systems.

Abstract: Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing
remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI
research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically
grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a
discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a
packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector
that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with
subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience.
Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules
(abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an
IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to
behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop.
This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term
memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information
Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline
producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure.
Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with
functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress
enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both
biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an
irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature
of complex information processing.

*Yule Wang,Joseph Yu,Chengrui Li,Weihan Li,Anqi Wu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIG-Vis, a method to analyze and visualize semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces in higher visual areas, validated on datasets from macaque IT cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods provide limited insights into how feature-specific visual information is distributed and organized across neural populations in higher visual areas, leaving the structure of these populations largely unexplored.

Method: MIG-Vis utilizes a variational autoencoder for disentangling neural latent subspaces and employs a mutual information-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the semantic features encoded in these subspaces.

Result: The method identifies neural latent groups with distinct semantic selectivity for visual features like object pose and category-based transformations. Validation was conducted on macaque IT cortex datasets.

Conclusion: MIG-Vis provides interpretable evidence for structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex, enhancing our understanding of its encoding principles.

Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode
object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational
neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between
artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings
are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations
themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features
from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.
This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual
information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,
and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful
subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages
the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the
visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first
uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent
subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information
(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific
visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on
multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of
two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies
neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual
features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and
intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of
structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our
understanding of its encoding principles.

### [436] [Private Realizable-to-Agnostic Transformation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01291)
*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves an agnostic learning transformation for private learners, eliminating dependence on privacy parameter ε and optimizing sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in prior methods for converting private learners between realizable and agnostic settings, particularly eliminating dependence on privacy factor ε.

Method: Develop a refined construction to achieve nearly optimal extra sample complexity while decoupling dependency on ε, and apply this to private prediction problems.

Result: The new method achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of O(VC(C)/α²) for ε ≤ 1 and resolves an open question in private prediction sample complexity.

Conclusion: This work advances private learning by providing better sample complexity bounds and insights into how privacy impacts different learning settings.

Abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et al.,
2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the
realizable setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the
concept class) to a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no
assumptions are imposed on the data). Specifically, for any concept class
$\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$, a private realizable learner for
$\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only
increasing the sample complexity by
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight
assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. However, when
$\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard
privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011),
resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$ that involves a
$1/\varepsilon$ factor.
  In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence
on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon\le 1$.
Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy
cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our
technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private
prediction problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman
(2018) and Dagan and Feldman (2020).

### [437] [Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion model for Categorical Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01329)
*Huangjie Zheng,Shansan Gong,Ruixiang Zhang,Tianrong Chen,Jiatao Gu,Mingyuan Zhou,Navdeep Jaitly,Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), enhancing discrete diffusion models by using continuous latent spaces for better generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discrete diffusion models lose semantic information due to uninformative masking, necessitating a framework to retain and utilize this information during generative tasks.

Method: CADD augments discrete state spaces with paired continuous latent spaces, using noisy latent vectors as semantic hints for denoising while being compatible with existing discrete diffusion setups.

Result: CADD improves generative performance in tasks like text generation, image synthesis, and code modeling, showing qualitative and quantitative gains over baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed CADD framework effectively addresses the limitations of masked-based diffusion by leveraging continuous latents, offering a controlled balance between output diversity and precision.

Abstract: Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by
mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void'
where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost
between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion
(CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired
diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted
states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent
vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD
may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete
denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion
training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the
continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage
(generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise
outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative
quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and
code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative
metrics against strong discrete baselines.

*Jiping Li,Rishi Sonthalia*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how minimum-norm interpolating solutions in linear regression behave under spiked covariance models, detailing the risk regimes and surprising effects of spike strength and target-spike alignment on generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how spike strengths and target-spike alignments influence generalization error, especially in overparameterized linear regression.

Method: The study involves analytical derivation of the generalization error using spiked covariance data models and examines regimes like benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting across various parameters.

Result: It provides an exact expression for generalization error, shows how high spike strengths can lead to catastrophic overfitting, and identifies conditions where target-spike alignment can be detrimental.

Conclusion: The findings offer counterintuitive insights into how alignment and spike strength affect generalization error, challenging assumptions and emphasizing nuanced interactions in linear regression models.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the generalization error of minimum-norm interpolating
solutions in linear regression using spiked covariance data models. The paper
characterizes how varying spike strengths and target-spike alignments can
affect risk, especially in overparameterized settings. The study presents an
exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive
classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based
on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \to \infty$),
and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing
spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before
achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike
alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes
counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment. Alignment with the
spike being detrimental is empirically demonstrated to persist in nonlinear
models.

*Lang Tong,Xinyi Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes TS-GPT, a specialized AI model for analyzing engineering time series using innovations representation theory, specifically targeting real-time monitoring and control. It demonstrates its application in forecasting locational marginal prices using U.S. energy market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering applications often require real-time monitoring and control based on time series data governed by physical laws, which large-language-model-based AI approaches fail to address effectively.

Method: The authors developed TS-GPT, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model based on innovations representation theory rather than linguistic models. Its approach involves probabilistic generative forecasting of future time series samples from conditional probabilities.

Result: TS-GPT is shown to effectively forecast locational marginal prices by leveraging historical data from U.S. independent system operators.

Conclusion: TS-GPT provides a novel framework for engineering time series analysis, showcasing its practical utility in engineering domains emphasizing real-time control and monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for
time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required
for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are
governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based
AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the
classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and
Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an
innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for
engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model
adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces
future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given
past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting
real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S.
independent system operators.

*Raphaël Carpintero Perez,Sébastien Da Veiga,Josselin Garnier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper conducts a reproducible comparative study of various categorical kernels for Gaussian process regression, introducing new evaluation metrics and proposing clustering-based strategies for scenarios with unknown group structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguous effectiveness of categorical kernels in Gaussian process regression due to inconsistencies in previous studies and the lack of reproducible code.

Method: A comparative analysis of existing categorical kernels, introduction of new evaluation metrics inspired by optimization studies, and a proposed clustering-based strategy using target encodings for cases with unknown group structures.

Result: The study found that nested kernels excel on datasets with known group structures. For datasets without such structures, the proposed clustering-based strategy outperformed other methods in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the superiority of nested kernels for specific cases and recommends the clustering-based strategy for broader datasets, offering reliable alternatives for Gaussian process regression with categorical variables.

Abstract: Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process
regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it
is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation
metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the
study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this
paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing
categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also
propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which
provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our
results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of
categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform
all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior
knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using
target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of
datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this
estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low
computational cost.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AlphaZero for portfolio replication in incomplete markets, outperforming deep hedging in non-convex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving portfolio replication techniques for incomplete markets, especially in scenarios with non-convexities.

Method: The study models a two-player game and employs AlphaZero, comparing its performance against deep hedging through both theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: Deep hedging struggles with non-convex environments, while AlphaZero consistently finds near-optimal strategies and demonstrates superior sample efficiency.

Conclusion: AlphaZero outperforms deep hedging in incomplete markets and is a promising alternative for applications involving non-convexities and data-scarce settings.

Abstract: This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets
- a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging,
balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a
two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes
strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by
the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an
AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely
used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis
and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the
$Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving
non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations -
converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to
highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds
near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a
connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its
effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further
suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in
data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented understanding of initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning in neural networks, particularly in the context of DLNs.

Method: Utilized Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) to derive a low-dimensional, effective process that captures high-dimensional gradient flow dynamics in DLNs.

Result: Provided new insights into DLN behaviors such as loss convergence rates and the trade-offs with generalization, while also systematically reproducing previously known phenomena.

Conclusion: The study improves the understanding of DLNs and demonstrates DMFT's utility for analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics in neural networks.

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several
nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as
initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena
are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently
understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in
the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT),
we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic
gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process
yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and
their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the
previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing
high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.

*Paul Felix Valsecchi Oliva,O. Deniz Akyildiz,Andrew Duncan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) using stochastic differential equations for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance PCD for training unnormalised densities by addressing gaps in optimization precision and providing explicit error bounds.

Method: The approach involves expressing PCD as a coupled multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and implementing it with stable stochastic integrators such as S-ROCK.

Result: Explicit error bounds between PCD iterates and the true MLE solution are derived, alongside uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for moments in the multiscale system.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient and accurate training of energy-based models (EBMs) with guaranteed long-time error estimates.

Abstract: We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence
(PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our
approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and
sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously.
  From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the
error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter.
This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the
difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An
efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced,
leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal
Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates
in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based
models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.

*Moritz Melcher,Simon Weissmann,Ashia C. Wilson,Jakob Zech*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Stein Variational Gradient Descent (Ad-SVGD), a method to improve kernel selection during Bayesian inference processes, thereby enhancing particle-based posterior approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference often struggles with efficiently approximating posterior distributions, particularly due to the sensitivity of SVGD dynamics to kernel choices.

Method: Ad-SVGD dynamically adjusts kernel bandwidths by alternating between particle updates via SVGD and tuning kernel parameters using gradient ascent based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD).

Result: Ad-SVGD demonstrates superior performance to traditional methods across multiple experimental tasks, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Adaptive tuning of kernel parameters improves both convergence properties and approximation quality in Bayesian inference processes, as validated by theoretical guarantees and empirical results for Ad-SVGD.

Abstract: A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating
posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular
variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate
a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel
function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality.
The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel
bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in
high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for
adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels.
Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD)
suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a
method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively
tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a
simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the
KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties
for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further
support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in
a variety of tasks.

*Lucas Morisset,Adrien Hardy,Alain Durmus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods for inverse covariance estimation in high-dimensional settings using linear shrinkage and data augmentation approaches, supported by theoretical and empirical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data challenges traditional methods for estimating precision matrices accurately. The authors aim to develop techniques that mitigate these challenges through novel approaches to improve estimation stability and accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces linear shrinkage estimators targeting the identity matrix and data augmentation techniques that use artificial samples. Theoretical tools like random matrix theory are employed to derive concentration bounds and novel deterministic equivalents.

Result: The authors successfully provide concentration bounds for quadratic error in the estimators, enabling practical method comparison and hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: These findings offer reliable estimation methods for precision matrices in complex data settings, demonstrating their effectiveness through theoretical guarantees and supportive numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as
precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we
focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target
proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data
augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a
dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or
through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting.
For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration
bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and
hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial
samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix
theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent
matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support
our theoretical results with numerical experiments.

### [446] [Hybrid Physics-ML Framework for Pan-Arctic Permafrost Infrastructure Risk at Record 2.9-Million Observation Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02189)
*Boris Kriuk*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study presents a hybrid physics-machine learning framework to address Arctic permafrost degradation's impact on infrastructure, enabling spatiotemporal risk assessment and providing projections for climate adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for assessing risks to infrastructure due to Arctic warming lack precision, validation, uncertainty assessment, and operational tools to support decision-making.

Method: The study develops a hybrid model combining a machine learning ensemble (Random Forest, Histogram Gradient Boosting, Elastic Net) and physical models for permafrost sensitivity. It integrates observational data from 171,605 locations to create validated, probabilistic projections under climate warming scenarios.

Result: The framework achieves a high level of accuracy (R2=0.980; RMSE=5.01 pp) through rigorous cross-validation. Projections show a significant decline in permafrost (up to 20 percentage points) and classify infrastructure risk zones (15% high-risk, 25% medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, validated tool for assessing Arctic permafrost risks to infrastructure, enabling climate adaptation planning. The hybrid approach bridges gaps in existing data-driven methods and is adaptable to other geographies.

Abstract: Arctic warming threatens over 100 billion in permafrost-dependent
infrastructure across Northern territories, yet existing risk assessment
frameworks lack spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and
operational decision-support capabilities. We present a hybrid physics-machine
learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations
(2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our
stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic
Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal
cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning
limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach
combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical
permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over
10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median:
-20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point
loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25%
medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents
the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first
operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and
delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for
engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is
generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid
approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change
applications.

*Xinyuan Liang,Longhao Qian,Yi Lok Lo,Hugh H. T. Liu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust neural control framework for drones transporting payloads with disturbance compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to design a robust control system for multi-drone payload transportation, ensuring trajectory tracking under external disturbances and input constraints.

Method: Combines Control Contraction Metric (CCM) for baseline control and Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) for dynamic disturbance compensation.

Result: The system achieves zero trajectory tracking error under certain disturbance assumptions, demonstrating stability and robustness in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework effectively tracks complex trajectories under disturbances, combining neural controllers and estimators for enhanced performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung
payload transportation system to track a reference path under external
disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural
exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input
saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance
estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent
disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the
controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero
trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The
stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM
controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated
trajectories under external disturbances.

*Shivam Bajpai,Abhinav Sinha,Shashi Ranjan Kumar*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a guaranteed interception strategy for aerial defense involving an evader, a defender, and a hostile pursuer using a novel cooperative guidance framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of ensuring interception of a hostile drone in highly dynamic and contested airspace scenarios, where traditional approaches may not suffice.

Method: The method uses a time-constrained guidance framework and a true proportional navigation approach, which does not rely on the pursuer’s strategy and is computationally efficient.

Result: The strategy guarantees interception within fixed time limits and proves effective across diverse simulations and adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed approach ensures robust and scalable solutions for real-time autonomous aerial defense in contested airspaces.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested
airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the
pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the
defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender
team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the
evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike
traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we
approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging
true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed
solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is
computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent
configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or
control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key
engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a
successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial
scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance
for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper compares Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for HVAC systems, with RL slightly outshining MPC in energy savings but facing practical challenges in comfort and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for scalable, efficient HVAC control strategies that reduce engineering efforts, enhancing automation for real-world deployments.

Method: The authors deployed and compared MPC and model-based RL controllers in a residential house for one month, assessing scalability, safety, and performance against the current control system.

Result: RL demonstrated 22% energy savings relative to the existing controller, slightly exceeding MPC's 20%, although MPC provided better energy savings normalized for occupant comfort.

Conclusion: RL offers automation benefits but introduces trade-offs in robustness and comfort, requiring further research in safe initialization, control-action accuracy, and online learning integrity to make RL scalable for HVAC systems.

Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer
significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial
engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises
greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in
real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing
challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To
investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC
and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month
period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana.
This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC
implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced
controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing
controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the
existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with
modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were
normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior
performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces
engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and
operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of
safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions
and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online
learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research
directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable
HVAC control solution.

*Berker Demirel,Marco Fumero,Theofanis Karaletsos,Francesco Locatello*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: MorphGen introduces a diffusion-based generative model for generating fluorescent microscopy images that preserves detailed cell morphology and enables analysis across varied cell types and perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model capable of accelerating high-content image-based assays essential for drug discovery and gene editing, while preserving biologically relevant structures and information.

Method: MorphGen uses a diffusion-based model trained with alignment loss to match its representations to phenotypic embeddings from OpenPhenom. Unlike previous methods, it generates the complete fluorescent channels for fine-grained morphological analysis.

Result: MorphGen demonstrates biological consistency through CellProfiler features and achieves a significant improvement, reducing the FID score by over 35% compared to the prior state-of-the-art, MorphoDiff.

Conclusion: MorphGen effectively enables controllable generation of cellular responses while maintaining detailed organelle-specific information, marking advancements in biological interpretation for fluorescent microscopy assays.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising
direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing
drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a
state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy
that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and
perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with
known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to
match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a
state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that
compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing
organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent
channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a
fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological
interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via
CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than
the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a
single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

TL;DR: This study benchmarks cell segmentation AI models, highlighting advances with CellViT++ and fused models that significantly improve accuracy in kidney pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in cell nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology caused by tissue diversity and imaging variability, and to evaluate the latest AI cell foundation models in this domain.

Method: Benchmarked advanced cell foundation models (e.g., CellViT++, Cellpose-SAM) against older models using a diverse kidney image dataset and a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework. Fusion-based ensemble methods and model agreement analysis were utilized.

Result: CellViT++ achieved the best performance, with 40.3% predictions rated as "Good" for challenging samples. A fused model further improved accuracy with 62.2% "Good" rates and minimized segmentation errors.

Conclusion: Recent AI advances, particularly fusion approaches, show strong potential in tackling segmentation challenges in kidney pathology and set the stage for future model developments.

Abstract: Accurate cell nuclei segmentation is critical for downstream tasks in kidney
pathology and remains a major challenge due to the morphological diversity and
imaging variability of renal tissues. While our prior work has evaluated
early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of
recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark
advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and
Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior
to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a
human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble
evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities
of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the
highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a
curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In
addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4%
"Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model
(2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained
unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of
AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated
dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model
refinement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEETLE, a diverse dataset for semantic segmentation in breast cancer WSIs, addressing the limitations of existing datasets and enhancing model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack morphological diversity, limiting model generalizability and robust biomarker validation for heterogeneous patient cohorts.

Method: The authors created the BEETLE dataset encompassing 587 WSIs with varied morphologies and annotations for four key classes, sourced from multiple clinical centers, public datasets, and scanners.

Result: BEETLE provides a diverse dataset covering all molecular subtypes and histological grades, which enables improved generalizability and supports standardized benchmarking of segmentation models.

Conclusion: BEETLE dataset has high reuse potential and can advance automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer by addressing current dataset limitations and providing a standardized evaluation platform.

Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for large-scale artificial
intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing
public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity
needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across
heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy
sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of
H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from
three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using
seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades.
Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four
classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other -
with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets,
such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The
dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated
biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse.
Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to
enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIOVERSE, a method to unify separate biomedical and large language model spaces for enhanced cross-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of siloed embedding spaces in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation models (BioFMs).

Method: BIOVERSE uses a two-stage process: modality-specific projection layers for alignment to a shared space and standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data.

Result: BIOVERSE demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal tasks like zero-shot annotation and protein function reasoning, surpassing larger LLM baselines.

Conclusion: BIOVERSE lays a robust groundwork for multi-modal biomedical reasoning, enabling richer and interactive outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation
models (BioFMs) have achieved strong results in biological text reasoning,
molecular modeling, and single-cell analysis, yet they remain siloed in
disjoint embedding spaces, limiting cross-modal reasoning. We present BIOVERSE
(Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage
approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them
with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The
approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently
trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies
standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for
downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded
in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question
answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning
cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning,
compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling
richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for
principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.

Motivation: To address the challenges of computational inefficiency and inaccuracies in docking optimization when using generative methods in early-stage drug discovery.

Method: A generative framework balancing pharmacophore similarity with structural diversity was developed, capable of incorporating custom reference datasets and guiding \\textit{de novo} drug generation. A case study focused on estrogen receptor targets for breast cancer was conducted.

Result: Generated compounds displayed strong pharmacophoric similarity with known active molecules while achieving significant structural novelty. Additionally, the framework proved robust based on evaluations against drug-like properties.

Conclusion: The method effectively generates novel, potentially patentable drug compounds with high pharmaceutical relevance, demonstrating promise for functional innovation in early drug discovery.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early-stage drug discovery
offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring chemical space and
accelerating hit-to-lead optimization. However, docking optimization in
generative approaches is computationally expensive and may lead to inaccurate
results. Here, we present a novel generative framework that balances
pharmacophore similarity to reference compounds with structural diversity from
active molecules. The framework allows users to provide custom reference sets,
including FDA-approved drugs or clinical candidates, and guides the \textit{de

through a case study targeting estrogen receptor modulators and antagonists for
breast cancer. The generated compounds maintain high pharmacophoric fidelity to

Motivation: Incompatibility between bioinformatics tools and AI-agent frameworks due to diverse formats and conventions hinders seamless integration.

Method: BioinfoMCP consists of two components: (1) BioinfoMCP Converter, which automates server generation via large language models, and (2) BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which validates converted tools for reliability across computational tasks.

Result: 38 bioinformatics tools were converted and validated, with 94.7% successfully operating in workflows across three AI-agent platforms.

Conclusion: The platform removes technical barriers, enabling natural language-based automation of complex bioinformatics tasks and fostering scalable, interoperable computational biology.

Abstract: Bioinformatics tools are essential for complex computational biology tasks,
yet their integration with emerging AI-agent frameworks is hindered by
incompatible interfaces, heterogeneous input-output formats, and inconsistent

BioinfoMCP, a unified platform comprising two components: BioinfoMCP Converter,
which automatically generates robust MCP servers from tool documentation using
large language models, and BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which systematically validates
the reliability and versatility of converted tools across diverse computational
tasks. We present a platform of 38 MCP-converted bioinformatics tools,
extensively validated to show that 94.7% successfully executed complex
workflows across three widely used AI-agent platforms. By removing technical
barriers to AI automation, BioinfoMCP enables natural-language interaction with
sophisticated bioinformatics analyses without requiring extensive programming

*Juraj Marusic,Marco Avella Medina,Cynthia Rush*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces and analyzes M-posteriors, a robust version of Bayesian posteriors linked to M-estimators in frequentist statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a connection between Bayesian posteriors and M-estimators, addressing robustness and consistency under a theoretical framework.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical framework for M-posteriors, derive their asymptotic properties, and propose new tools like a posterior influence function and posterior breakdown point.

Result: The paper shows that M-posteriors are asymptotically normal, centered around an M-estimator, and demonstrate robustness and consistency under the proposed framework.

Conclusion: M-posteriors offer a robust Bayesian alternative with frequentist properties, validated by theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework for a wide class of generalized posteriors
that can be viewed as the natural Bayesian posterior counterpart of the class
of M-estimators in the frequentist world. We call the members of this class
M-posteriors and show that they are asymptotically normally distributed under
mild conditions on the M-estimation loss and the prior. In particular, an
M-posterior contracts in probability around a normal distribution centered at
an M-estimator, showing frequentist consistency and suggesting some degree of
robustness depending on the reference M-estimator. We formalize the robustness
properties of the M-posteriors by a new characterization of the posterior
influence function and a novel definition of breakdown point adapted for
posterior distributions. We illustrate the wide applicability of our theory in
various popular models and illustrate their empirical relevance in some
numerical examples.

TL;DR: DiffKnock is a diffusion-based method for high-dimensional feature selection with false discovery rate control, outperforming other knockoff methods in power and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knockoff methods struggle with preserving complex feature dependencies and detecting non-linear associations, presenting challenges in analyzing high-dimensional structured data.

Method: DiffKnock uses diffusion models to generate knockoffs, paired with neural network-based statistics to make feature importance calculations antisymmetric.

Result: DiffKnock showed superior power compared to autoencoder-based knockoffs, while maintaining false discovery rate targets, and successfully analyzed murine single-cell RNA-seq data.

Conclusion: DiffKnock effectively combines deep generative models with statistical guarantees, proving valuable for applications in single-cell RNA-seq analysis and other domains with high-dimensional structured data.

Abstract: We introduce DiffKnock, a diffusion-based knockoff framework for
high-dimensional feature selection with finite-sample false discovery rate
(FDR) control. DiffKnock addresses two key limitations of existing knockoff
methods: preserving complex feature dependencies and detecting non-linear
associations. Our approach trains diffusion models to generate valid knockoffs
and uses neural network--based gradient and filter statistics to construct
antisymmetric feature importance measures. Through simulations, we showed that
DiffKnock achieved higher power than autoencoder-based knockoffs while
maintaining target FDR, indicating its superior performance in scenarios
involving complex non-linear architectures. Applied to murine single-cell
RNA-seq data of LPS-stimulated macrophages, DiffKnock identifies canonical
NF-$\kappa$B target genes (Ccl3, Hmox1) and regulators (Fosb, Pdgfb). These
results highlight that, by combining the flexibility of deep generative models
with rigorous statistical guarantees, DiffKnock is a powerful and reliable tool
for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, as well as high-dimensional and
structured data in other domains.

*Jianwei Shi,Sameh Abdulah,Ying Sun,Marc G. Genton*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper develops an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data, aiming to address privacy and communication constraints while improving robustness and scalability in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and communication limitations in distributed spatial data systems, such as environmental sensor networks, make direct data sharing unsuitable. The paper aims to provide timely high-resolution modeling without centralizing raw data while addressing inefficiencies in existing federated approaches.

Method: The proposed method uses low-rank Gaussian process approximations with block-wise optimization and novel strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates for asynchronous processing.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows linear convergence with dependency on staleness. Experiments demonstrate the asynchronous method matches synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and outperforms it in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, robust solution for federated spatial modeling under privacy and bandwidth constraints, overcoming limitations of prior synchronous approaches and supporting distributed high-resolution mapping applications.

Abstract: Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and
urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and
communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a
practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling
across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks
are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling
that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely,
high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing
federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on
synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments.
This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial
data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs
block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction,
adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence
with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical
significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous
algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation
and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior
robustness and scalability.

*Yann McLatchie,Badr-Eddine Cherief-Abdellatif,David T. Frazier,Jeremias Knoblauch*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces the predictively oriented (PrO) posterior, a new statistical principle that combines the strengths of parameter inference and density estimation to achieve predictive dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical and generalized Bayesian methods, especially their inefficacy in handling model misspecification, and to develop a method that focuses on predictive ability as a measure of uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose the PrO posterior, which adapts to model misspecification by not converging to a misspecified model. They also detail its convergence rates and present an algorithm based on mean-field Langevin dynamics for practical implementation.

Result: The PrO posterior achieves rate-optimal predictive performance ($n^{-1/2}$), adapts to levels of model misspecification, and highlights irreducible uncertainty. Numerical examples confirm its practical advantages over traditional methods.

Conclusion: PrO posteriors offer a novel and effective way of addressing uncertainty by focusing on predictive performance instead of strict adherence to a potentially misspecified model. They outperform classical approaches in both theory and practice.

Abstract: We advocate for a new statistical principle that combines the most desirable
aspects of both parameter inference and density estimation. This leads us to
the predictively oriented (PrO) posterior, which expresses uncertainty as a
consequence of predictive ability. Doing so leads to inferences which
predictively dominate both classical and generalised Bayes posterior predictive
distributions: up to logarithmic factors, PrO posteriors converge to the
predictively optimal model average at rate $n^{-1/2}$. Whereas classical and
generalised Bayes posteriors only achieve this rate if the model can recover
the data-generating process, PrO posteriors adapt to the level of model
misspecification. This means that they concentrate around the true model at
rate $n^{1/2}$ in the same way as Bayes and Gibbs posteriors if the model can
recover the data-generating distribution, but do \textit{not} concentrate in
the presence of non-trivial forms of model misspecification. Instead, they
stabilise towards a predictively optimal posterior whose degree of irreducible
uncertainty admits an interpretation as the degree of model misspecification --
a sharp contrast to how Bayesian uncertainty and its existing extensions
behave. Lastly, we show that PrO posteriors can be sampled from by evolving
particles based on mean field Langevin dynamics, and verify the practical
significance of our theoretical developments on a number of numerical examples.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of a dedicated large-scale dataset for advancing Text-to-SQL research in the financial domain, which is necessary due to complex schemas, domain-specific language, and high risks of errors.

Method: The authors created the FINCH dataset consisting of 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL pairs. They benchmarked various models and proposed the FINCH Score metric for nuanced evaluation.

Result: The paper provided a systematic analysis of models' performance in the financial Text-to-SQL domain, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The FINCH Score offers better assessment of model performance compared to existing metrics.

Conclusion: FINCH serves as a crucial stepping stone in bridging the gap for financial Text-to-SQL research, equipping the community with a robust dataset and a domain-relevant evaluation metric to advance the field.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has long been a central challenge in NLP. While progress has been
significant, applying it to the financial domain remains especially difficult
due to complex schema, domain-specific terminology, and high stakes of error.
Despite this, there is no dedicated large-scale financial dataset to advance
research, creating a critical gap. To address this, we introduce a curated
financial dataset (FINCH) comprising 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL
pairs, enabling both fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation. Building on this
resource, we benchmark reasoning models and language models of varying scales,
providing a systematic analysis of their strengths and limitations in financial
Text-to-SQL tasks. Finally, we propose a finance-oriented evaluation metric
(FINCH Score) that captures nuances overlooked by existing measures, offering a
more faithful assessment of model performance.

### [461] [Towards Photonic Band Diagram Generation with Transformer-Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01749)
*Valentin Delchevalerie,Nicolas Roy,Arnaud Bougaham,Alexandre Mayer,Benoît Frénay,Michaël Lobet*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for generating photonic band diagrams (BDs) using diffusion models and transformer encoders, aiming to address computational challenges in photonic crystal design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational expense of generating photonic band diagrams, a crucial tool in photonic and quantum technologies, especially for optimization and inverse design, necessitates new approaches.

Method: The approach combines transformer encoders for extracting contextual embeddings of input structures with a latent diffusion model to generate photonic band diagrams.

Result: The method demonstrates the capability to generalize and scale to arbitrary three-dimensional structures, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional BD generation.

Conclusion: The synergy between transformer encoders and diffusion models can effectively address the complex phenomena in photonic structures, offering promising directions for surrogate modeling in this field.

Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the
nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and
quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to
investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.
However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many
configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in
optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this
challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion
models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three
dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which
extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent
diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide
insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture
the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving
the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

### [462] [Exponential convergence of a distributed divide-and-conquer algorithm for constrained convex optimization on networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01511)
*Nazar Emirov,Guohui Song,Qiyu Sun*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fully distributed divide-and-conquer algorithm for constrained convex optimization over networks with exponential convergence and validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving constrained convex optimization problems in a distributed manner across networks, where each agent has a local objective function.

Method: The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, solving local subproblems around fusion centers while coordinating only with neighboring fusion centers. It ensures smoothness, strong convexity, and adheres to polynomial growth conditions.

Result: The DAC algorithm exhibits exponential convergence under standard assumptions, with explicit bounds derived for local solvers. Numerical experiments validate its scalability and effectiveness across multiple types of loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed DAC algorithm is a scalable and effective framework for distributed constrained convex optimization with strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: We propose a divide-and-conquer (DAC) algorithm for constrained convex
optimization over networks, where the global objective is the sum of local
objectives attached to individual agents. The algorithm is fully distributed:
each iteration solves local subproblems around selected fusion centers and
coordinates only with neighboring fusion centers. Under standard assumptions of
smoothness, strong convexity, and locality on the objective function, together
with polynomial growth conditions on the underlying graph, we establish
exponential convergence of the DAC iterations and derive explicit bounds for
both exact and inexact local solvers. Numerical experiments on three
representative losses ($L_2$ distance, quadratic, and entropy) confirm the
theory and demonstrate scalability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeMuon, a decentralized optimization method with built-in guarantees that outperforms existing approaches in preliminary tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decentralized matrix optimization while ensuring theoretical complexity guarantees and handling issues like heterogeneity and heavy-tailed noise.

Method: DeMuon uses Newton-Schulz iterations for matrix orthogonalization and gradient tracking to tackle the challenges in decentralized optimization settings.

Result: DeMuon's complexity matches that of centralized algorithms, and it performs better in preliminary numerical experiments for decentralized transformer pretraining on various network topologies.

Conclusion: DeMuon is a novel method with provable guarantees, effectively transferring centralized techniques to decentralized optimization setups with improved outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix
optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix
orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its
centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate
heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and
additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon
for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result
matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of
dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the
first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with
provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on
decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of
connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement
of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network
topologies.

### [464] [Smooth Quasar-Convex Optimization with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01943)
*David Martínez-Rubio*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper tackles the problem of designing an accelerated algorithm for constrained quasar-convex optimization, achieving nearly optimal first-order query complexity, and provides analyses of first-order methods under these constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open challenge of designing accelerated algorithms for smooth and quasar-convex functions under general convex constraints, filling a gap in current nearly optimal methods that are limited to affine spaces.

Method: The authors propose an inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm that operates using a first-order method, achieving a near-optimal query complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$. They also analyze the effectiveness of projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe algorithms in the same constrained setting.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves the desired query complexity for constrained quasar-convex optimization, improving upon prior results. Additionally, analyses of projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe algorithms are provided, offering valuable insights in this setting.

Conclusion: The study advances the field by presenting the first analyses of first-order methods for constrained quasar-convex optimization, equipping researchers with tools that effectively handle general convex constraints.

Abstract: Quasar-convex functions form a broad nonconvex class with applications to
linear dynamical systems, generalized linear models, and Riemannian
optimization, among others. Current nearly optimal algorithms work only in
affine spaces due to the loss of one degree of freedom when working with
general convex constraints. Obtaining an accelerated algorithm that makes
nearly optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$ first-order queries
to a $\gamma$-quasar convex smooth function \emph{with constraints} was
independently asked as an open problem in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022); Lezane,
Langer, and Koolen (2024). In this work, we solve this question by designing an
inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm that we implement using a
first-order method achieving the aforementioned rate and, as a consequence, we
improve the complexity of the accelerated geodesically Riemannian optimization
solution in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022). We also analyze projected gradient descent
and Frank-Wolfe algorithms in this constrained quasar-convex setting. To the
best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analyses of first-order
methods for quasar-convex smooth functions with general convex constraints.

### [465] [Exponential Quantum Advantage for Message Complexity in Distributed Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01657)
*François Le Gall,Maël Luce,Joseph Marchand,Mathieu Roget*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes that quantum distributed algorithms can exhibit exponential efficiency in message complexity compared to classical distributed algorithms, specifically for routing tasks in networks with welded tree structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantify the advantages of quantum distributed algorithms over classical ones, particularly focusing on message complexity, a critical metric in distributed systems.

Method: The authors use a quantum distributed algorithm leveraging "succinct" quantum walks on welded trees, combined with a classical lower bound extended from earlier query complexity results to message complexity.

Result: The paper demonstrates that for welded trees, quantum distributed algorithms can route messages with exponentially lower message complexity than any classical algorithm.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the significant potential of quantum algorithms to revolutionize distributed computing systems by achieving dramatic gains in communication efficiency for specific tasks.

Abstract: We investigate how much quantum distributed algorithms can outperform
classical distributed algorithms with respect to the message complexity (the
overall amount of communication used by the algorithm). Recently, Dufoulon,
Magniez and Pandurangan (PODC 2025) have shown a polynomial quantum advantage
for several tasks such as leader election and agreement. In this paper, we show
an exponential quantum advantage for a fundamental task: routing information
between two specified nodes of a network. We prove that for the family of
``welded trees" introduced in the seminal work by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003), there exists a quantum distributed algorithm
that transfers messages from the entrance of the graph to the exit with message
complexity exponentially smaller than any classical algorithm. Our quantum
algorithm is based on the recent "succinct" implementation of quantum walks
over the welded trees by Li, Li and Luo (SODA 2024). Our classical lower bound
is obtained by ``lifting'' the lower bound from Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003) from query complexity to message complexity.

### [466] [Quantum-Assisted Correlation Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03561)
*Antonio Macaluso,Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh,Diego Arenas,Matthias Klusch,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical method for correlation clustering that leverages quantum annealing to optimize graph partitioning, achieving superior performance compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current correlation clustering methods, such as dependency on metric assumptions and predefined cluster numbers, to better handle signed graphs and complex correlation structures.

Method: The authors adapt the GCS-Q solver and integrate quantum annealing within a hierarchical clustering framework to optimize bipartitioning at each step, implementing it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms classical algorithms in clustering quality and robustness, especially in datasets with imbalanced cluster sizes and real-world data applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that hybrid quantum-classical optimization is a promising approach for scalable and structurally-aware clustering in graph-based unsupervised learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical method to correlation
clustering, a graph-based unsupervised learning task that seeks to partition
the nodes in a graph based on pairwise agreement and disagreement. In
particular, we adapt GCS-Q, a quantum-assisted solver originally designed for
coalition structure generation, to maximize intra-cluster agreement in signed
graphs through recursive divisive partitioning. The proposed method encodes
each bipartitioning step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problem, solved via quantum annealing. This integration of quantum optimization
within a hierarchical clustering framework enables handling of graphs with
arbitrary correlation structures, including negative edges, without relying on
metric assumptions or a predefined number of clusters. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic signed graphs and real-world hyperspectral imaging data demonstrate
that, when adapted for correlation clustering, GCS-Q outperforms classical
algorithms in robustness and clustering quality on real-world data and in
scenarios with cluster size imbalance. Our results highlight the promise of
hybrid quantum-classical optimization for advancing scalable and
structurally-aware clustering techniques in graph-based unsupervised learning.

### [467] [Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02218)
*Mark M. Wilde*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix using divergences, focusing on key types like the log-Euclidean, α-z, and geometric Rènyi relative entropies, and presents theoretical findings and applications in quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge gaps in quantum information theory by deriving quantum generalizations of Fisher information matrices, which are useful in diverse areas of physics and computational fields like machine learning.

Method: The author uses divergences and the method of divided differences for matrix derivatives to derive quantum Fisher information matrices based on log-Euclidean Rènyi, geometric Rènyi, and α-z Rènyi relative entropies.

Result: Derived matrices obey the data-processing inequality for non-negative Rènyi parameters, even when original divergence quantities do not. Formulas for α-z information matrices for parameterized thermal states are established, along with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper enriches quantum information science by elucidating key properties of quantum Fisher information matrices and offering computational tools with implications in quantum machine learning and optimization.

Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum
information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter
physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization.
One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a
natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth
divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,
given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to
the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher
information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization
of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I
derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and
geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so
being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.
Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$,
the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information
matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the
right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting
information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative
values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do
not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$
information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative
entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their
$\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for
estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

### [468] [How to Find Fantastic Papers: Self-Rankings as a Powerful Predictor of Scientific Impact Beyond Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02143)
*Buxin Su,Natalie Collina,Garrett Wen,Didong Li,Kyunghyun Cho,Jianqing Fan,Bingxin Zhao,Weijie Su*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Authors' self-rankings of their AI conference submissions predict high-impact research better than peer review scores, as self-ranked top submissions receive significantly more citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer reviews often struggle to identify high-impact scientific research due to the increasing volume of submissions, particularly in rapidly evolving fields like AI.

Method: The study involved 1,342 researchers self-ranking 2,592 submissions to an AI conference to assess the predictive value of these rankings compared to peer review scores in tracking citation outcomes over a year.

Result: Papers ranked highest by authors received twice the citations of the lowest-ranked ones and outperformed peer review scores in predicting highly-cited papers and overall citation counts.

Conclusion: Authors' insights, expressed through self-ranking, can effectively complement peer review processes to identify impactful research in AI field.

Abstract: Peer review in academic research aims not only to ensure factual correctness
but also to identify work of high scientific potential that can shape future
research directions. This task is especially critical in fast-moving fields
such as artificial intelligence (AI), yet it has become increasingly difficult
given the rapid growth of submissions. In this paper, we investigate an
underexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own
rankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in
game-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative
because authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth
and long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale
experiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked
their 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than
a year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as
many citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were
especially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150
citations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review
scores in predicting future citation counts. Our results remained robust after
accounting for confounders such as preprint posting time and self-citations.
Together, these findings demonstrate that authors' self-rankings provide a
reliable and valuable complement to peer review for identifying and elevating
high-impact research in AI.

*Saranya Ganesh S.,Frederick Iat-Hin Tam,Milton S. Gomez,Marie McGraw,Mark DeMaria,Kate Musgrave,Jakob Runge,Tom Beucler*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study uses causal discovery to enhance hurricane intensity forecasting and proves the value of causally selected features over conventional correlation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Atlantic hurricane intensity forecasts is limited by nonlinear interactions and difficulty in identifying relevant predictors, while conventional methods often overlook confounding variables.

Method: A multidata causal discovery framework was employed to select relevant predictors of hurricane intensity changes using replicated SHIPS datasets based on ERA5 reanalysis. Models were trained with various feature selection approaches for comparison.

Result: Causally selected predictors significantly enhance test forecast performance, especially for shorter lead times, compared to correlation-based and random feature importance selections.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that causally discovered predictors improve short- and long-term hurricane intensity forecasts, enabling more accurate and empirical predictions.

Abstract: Improving statistical forecasts of Atlantic hurricane intensity is limited by
complex nonlinear interactions and difficulty in identifying relevant
predictors. Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often
overlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen
tropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery
framework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity
Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct
multiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to
hurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to
compare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random
forest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24
to 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test
cases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features
primarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and
surface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often
underutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended
predictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS
predictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times
of 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron
further extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely
regional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests
confirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve
forecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate
that causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way
toward more empirical forecasts.

*Xinyang Li,Vlad C. Andrei,Peter J. Gu,Yiqi Chen,Ullrich J. Mönich,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework using neural network encoders for extracting secret keys from correlated random sources, with potential applications in physical layer security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical and efficient method for extracting common randomness and secret keys in scenarios involving correlated random sources, while ensuring minimal leakage of information to eavesdroppers.

Method: A two-stage framework: first, a variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step using probabilistic neural network encoders to create discrete random variables with high agreement and low information leakage; second, a secure sketch method to reconcile the outputs into identical secret keys.

Result: The proposed system is validated through both simulations and real-world measurements, showcasing its feasibility and strong performance even when adversaries have partial knowledge.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for secure key generation, particularly for high mobility scenarios and ISAC systems, overcoming limitations of traditional methods reliant on channel reciprocity.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

Motivation: Address the challenges of diagnosing Chagas disease in regions with limited serological testing, including accuracy, reliance on labeled datasets, and lack of integration with clinical indicators.

Method: Proposed a retrieval-augmented generation framework (CardioRAG) that uses large language models integrated with interpretable ECG-derived clinical features and variational autoencoders for semantic case retrieval.

Result: Achieved high recall (89.80%) and a maximum F1 score of 0.68 in identifying cases for prioritized serological testing.

Conclusion: CardioRAG offers an interpretable and evidence-based AI system especially suited for resource-constrained settings, providing a pathway to embed clinical indicators in trustworthy AI models.

Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas
cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where
serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG)
screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine
learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large
labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based
clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation
framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable
ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior
fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses
variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval,
providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated
high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for
effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological
testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach
particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway
for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents ShapeGen3DCP, a neural network for predicting 3D concrete printing cross-sectional geometries based on material and process parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an efficient and accurate way to predict extruded geometries in 3D concrete printing, replacing time-consuming trial-and-error processes.

Method: The framework combines neural networks with dimensionless parameters for input features and Fourier descriptors for shape representation. Training data is generated using a Particle Finite Element Model (PFEM).

Result: Validation with numerical and experimental data demonstrated strong accuracy and reliability of predictions.

Conclusion: ShapeGen3DCP provides a practical tool for optimizing 3D concrete printing processes, with potential for advanced applications like real-time feedback loops and digital twins.

Abstract: This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and
accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete
Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that
takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield
stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle
height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer
shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into
dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted
geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce
smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a
small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated
using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP,
overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse
numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the
framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses
ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating
trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced
designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor
feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time
process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing
parameters.

### [475] [Financial Stability Implications of Generative AI: Taming the Animal Spirits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01451)
*Anne Lundgaard Hansen,Seung Jung Lee*

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: This study examines how generative AI influences financial stability through trading experiments. AI agents tend to make rational decisions but can be guided to herd optimally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether the adoption of generative AI in trading impacts herd behavior, asset price bubbles, and financial stability.

Method: Laboratory-style experiments utilized large language models to simulate classic herd behavior in trading scenarios.

Result: AI agents prioritize private information over market trends, leading to fewer asset price bubbles. However, inducing optimal herding and human-like biases may affect financial stability.

Conclusion: Generative AI could improve market discipline but still poses complex implications for financial stability due to inherited human-like biases and optimal herding behavior.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the adoption of generative AI on
financial stability. We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large
language models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in trading
decisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than
humans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends.
Increased reliance on AI-powered trading advice could therefore potentially
lead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by
following the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings
reveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided
to make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market
discipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial
stability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not
purely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and
bias.

### [476] [Integrated Security Mechanisms for Weight Protection in Memristive Crossbar Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01350)
*Muhammad Faheemur Rahman,Wayne Burleson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing but face security risks. This paper introduces two mechanisms to protect stored weights with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to safeguard valuable intellectual property in memristive crossbar arrays against security threats while enabling verifiable ownership.

Method: Proposed two mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns, which safeguard weights and establish ownership while minimally modifying existing architectures.

Result: Simulations across various CMOS nodes and initial experiments using MNIST dataset demonstrated robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay, and power.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms successfully secure memristive in-memory computing systems, ensuring robust protection and verifiable ownership with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel
analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine
learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their
advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as
adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised.
Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable
intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes
using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security
mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both
safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of
data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive
crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations
across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and
a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with
under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial
experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the
feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal
performance trade-offs.

### [477] [Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223)
*Hui Dou,Ning Xu,Yiwen Zhang,Kaibin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RTS-Attack, an automated framework that exploits LLM vulnerabilities using nested scenarios and toxic knowledge to bypass alignment defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face vulnerabilities from jailbreak attacks that prompt harmful responses. Traditional methods using nested scenarios are easily detected due to overt maliciousness. Addressing this limitation could significantly advance the understanding and improvement of LLM defenses.

Method: RTS-Attack constructs semantically relevant nested scenarios integrated with targeted toxic knowledge to challenge LLM alignment defenses, ensuring adaptability and covert harmful query generation.

Result: RTS-Attack outperforms competing methods in efficiency and universality across major LLMs, successfully bypassing alignment constraints without directly incorporating harmful queries.

Conclusion: RTS-Attack demonstrates the vulnerability of LLM defenses against sophisticated attack methods and underscores the need for further research to strengthen alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

*Yinuo Liu,Ruohan Xu,Xilong Wang,Yuqi Jia,Neil Zhenqiang Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark study to evaluate methods for detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting prompt injection attacks have not been systematically evaluated for web agents, leaving a research gap.

Method: The study categorizes attacks based on threat models, creates datasets with both malicious and benign samples, systematizes detection methods, and evaluates them across scenarios.

Result: Detectors perform moderately to highly on attacks with explicit instructions or visible perturbations but fail against implicit or imperceptible attacks.

Conclusion: Existing detection methods must be improved to handle more nuanced and stealthy prompt injection attacks in web agents.

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

*Shoumik Saha,Jifan Chen,Sam Mayers,Sanjay Krishna Gouda,Zijian Wang,Varun Kumar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: JAWS-BENCH assesses how code-capable LLM agents handle malicious programs across three workspace setups, showing vulnerabilities increase when agents utilize tools and multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising risks associated with code-capable LLM agents executing malicious programs in software engineering workflows.

Method: Developed JAWS-BENCH, a benchmark with three workspace setups, paired with an executable-aware Judge Framework to evaluate compliance and attack success rates.

Result: Code agents accepted 61% of attacks in simple settings, with attack success rates escalating with workspace complexity and multi-step tool use.

Conclusion: Vulnerabilities are heightened by agent reasoning and tool use, calling for execution-aware defenses and mechanisms to safeguard refusal decisions.

Abstract: Code-capable large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly embedded into
software engineering workflows where they can read, write, and execute code,
raising the stakes of safety-bypass ("jailbreak") attacks beyond text-only
settings. Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection,
leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We
present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three
escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0),
single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a
hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii)
attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability,
moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five
families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code
agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27%
run end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~
100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the
multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly
deployable attack code. Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent
substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial
refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps.
Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and
most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps. These
findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and
mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step
reasoning and tool use.

### [480] [ZK-WAGON: Imperceptible Watermark for Image Generation Models using ZK-SNARKs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01967)
*Aadarsh Anantha Ramakrishnan,Shubham Agarwal,Selvanayagam S,Kunwar Singh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZK-WAGON, a watermarking system for image generation models using ZK-SNARKs, addressing concerns like image authenticity and misuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for secure and scalable methods to verify authenticity in lifelike synthetic images due to risks like misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright issues.

Method: Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC) is employed to build ZK-SNARK proofs, embedded into images using LSB steganography.

Result: Their approach works seamlessly with GAN and Diffusion models, with reduced proof creation times, ensuring security and model-agnostic operations.

Conclusion: ZK-WAGON provides a trustworthy framework for AI-generated image verification without exposing sensitive model information.

Abstract: As image generation models grow increasingly powerful and accessible,
concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse of synthetic media have
become critical. The ability to generate lifelike images indistinguishable from
real ones introduces risks such as misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual
property violations. Traditional watermarking methods either degrade image
quality, are easily removed, or require access to confidential model internals
- making them unsuitable for secure and scalable deployment. We are the first
to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models
using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge
(ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing
model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We
propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively
convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof
generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly
embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a
secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.

### [481] [Position: Privacy Is Not Just Memorization!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01645)
*Niloofar Mireshghallah,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper discusses underexplored privacy risks in LLMs beyond memorization, presenting a taxonomy of threats and gaps in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address diverse privacy risks in LLMs, beyond the narrow focus on training data memorization.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of privacy risks, analyze case studies, and review 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers from 2016 to 2025.

Result: The study highlights that current privacy research is overly focused on memorization while failing to tackle other pressing privacy issues.

Conclusion: A shift towards interdisciplinary approaches is needed to address the sociotechnical privacy challenges in LLMs.

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

*Luoxi Tang,Yuqiao Meng,Ankita Patra,Weicheng Ma,Muchao Ye,Zhaohan Xi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), identifying three key issues: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address significant performance gaps in LLMs when deployed in practical CTI tasks, driven by intrinsic challenges in the threat landscape rather than model architecture.

Method: The researchers use large-scale evaluations across benchmarks and real-world threat reports, employing stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to categorize and analyze failure instances.

Result: The analysis reveals three intrinsic vulnerabilities in LLM-powered CTI systems, providing detailed insights into spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-based CTI systems, paving the way for improvements and future research in cyber threat intelligence applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts
in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer
cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and
incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide
range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and
intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical
deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of
LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat
landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale
evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we
introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification,
autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably
analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections,
we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations,
contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in
effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for
designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

*Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient multi-modal federated healthcare using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for cross-agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving and interoperable mechanisms integrating heterogeneous medical data in digitally constrained environments.

Method: The framework unified multi-modal feature alignment, secure aggregation with differential privacy, and energy-aware scheduling using MCP.

Result: Achieved a 9.8% improvement in diagnostic accuracy, a 54% reduction in client dropout rates, and clinically acceptable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The MCP framework demonstrates scalable and equitable solutions for next-gen federated healthcare systems addressing security, privacy, and interoperability challenges.

Abstract: Secure and interoperable integration of heterogeneous medical data remains a
grand challenge in digital health. Current federated learning (FL) frameworks
offer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to
orchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained
environments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent
communication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed
architecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for
clinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii)
secure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive
updates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile
clients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables
adaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance
with privacy regulations. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets and
pilot clinical cohorts demonstrates up to 9.8\% improvement in diagnostic
accuracy compared with baseline FL, a 54\% reduction in client dropout rates,
and clinically acceptable privacy--utility trade-offs. These results highlight
MCP-enabled multi-modal fusion as a scalable and trustworthy pathway toward
equitable, next-generation federated health infrastructures.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines how adversarial attacks can exploit Gmail's malware detection pipeline and proposes defenses to mitigate these vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address system vulnerabilities posed by adversarial attacks targeting machine learning (ML) components in production systems, specifically in Gmail's malware detection pipeline.

Method: The authors analyzed Gmail's malware detection flow, targeting the Magika ML model to craft adversarial examples and propose mitigations. They collaborated with Google engineers to deploy their defenses in production.

Result: The attacks altered just 13 bytes in a malware to evade Magika with a 90% success rate, while the defense raised the bar to 50 bytes and reduced attack success to 20%.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks can degrade critical systems like Gmail's malware detector, but robust defenses can significantly mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: As deep learning models become widely deployed as components within larger
production systems, their individual shortcomings can create system-level
vulnerabilities with real-world impact. This paper studies how adversarial
attacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire
production-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of
Gmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model.
  The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning
model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware
classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has
been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can
cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an
unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection.
Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can
successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware
files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an
approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended
production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve
just a 20% attack success rate. We implement this defense, and, thanks to a
collaboration with Google engineers, it has already been deployed in production
for the Gmail classifier.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoMod ML-Attack, a cryptanalytic method targeting Module-LWE-based cryptographic schemes, combining a novel approach to modular reduction handling and enhanced lattice preprocessing to recover secrets effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of quantum computing poses a threat to classical public-key cryptography, particularly schemes relying on problems like Module-LWE, necessitating the development of resilient cryptanalytic techniques.

Method: The paper presents NoMod ML-Attack, a white-box cryptanalytic method that interprets modular wrap-arounds as statistical corruption and applies robust linear estimation techniques, supported by lattice preprocessing optimizations.

Result: NoMod ML-Attack demonstrates successful full secret recovery under various scenarios, including binary secrets for dimension 350 and sparse secrets in specific CRYSTALS-Kyber parameter settings.

Conclusion: The results showcase the efficacy of NoMod ML-Attack in breaking certain post-quantum cryptographic implementations, emphasizing the importance of strengthening such schemes against advanced cryptanalytic techniques.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens classical public-key cryptography,
motivating NIST's adoption of post-quantum schemes such as those based on the
Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem. We present NoMod ML-Attack, a
hybrid white-box cryptanalytic method that circumvents the challenge of
modeling modular reduction by treating wrap-arounds as statistical corruption
and casting secret recovery as robust linear estimation. Our approach combines
optimized lattice preprocessing--including reduced-vector saving and algebraic
amplification--with robust estimators trained via Tukey's Biweight loss.
Experiments show NoMod achieves full recovery of binary secrets for dimension
$n = 350$, recovery of sparse binomial secrets for $n = 256$, and successful
recovery of sparse secrets in CRYSTALS-Kyber settings with parameters $(n, k) =
(128, 3)$ and $(256, 2)$. We release our implementation in an anonymous
repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NoMod-3BD4.

*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carol Espy Wilson*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of public classroom speech datasets by proposing a method to synthesize classroom noise and RIRs using game engines and presenting RealClass, a dataset of synthesized classroom noise combined with speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale and publicly available classroom speech datasets, along with the absence of classroom noise corpora, limits AI-driven educational speech model development.

Method: The authors developed a scalable methodology using game engines to synthesize classroom noise and RIRs. RealClass was created by combining synthesized noise and classroom speech from publicly available sources.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RealClass approximates real classroom speech well under clean and noisy conditions.

Conclusion: RealClass provides an effective solution for simulating authentic classroom speech interactions, filling a critical gap in educational AI research data.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Classroom datasets remain
limited and not publicly available, and the absence of dedicated classroom
noise or Room Impulse Response (RIR) corpora prevents the use of standard data
augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise and RIRs using game engines, a versatile framework that can extend to
other domains beyond the classroom. Building on this methodology, we present
RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a
classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech
data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from
YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Experiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates
real classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant
real classroom speech.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) method that achieves precise control over phoneme-level emotions through disentangled style representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve current emotional TTS systems that rely on global style encoders by enabling nuanced phoneme-level emotional embeddings while separating intrinsic attributes like timbre and emotion.

Method: The proposed method uses a style disentanglement approach to guide two feature extractors. It reduces mutual information between timbre and emotion features, enabling the separation of distinct style components in the reference speech.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method surpasses baseline systems in generating speech that is both natural and emotionally expressive.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that disentangling and introducing fine-grained representations can enhance the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

Abstract: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on
reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not
capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we
propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level
emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the
reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to
guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and
emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the
reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This
work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations
in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing voice quality evaluation, aiming to address shortcomings of human and existing objective metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the difficulty of evaluating singing voice quality effectively, which is often constrained by costly human assessments and limited-objective metrics.

Method: The authors created the SingMOS-Pro dataset with expanded annotations covering lyrics, melody, and overall quality. It includes 7,981 singing clips from 41 models, each rated by certified annotators for reliability.

Result: SingMOS-Pro establishes strong baselines for evaluation methods and serves as a reference for future research. It also provides a substantial dataset with diverse samples and detailed quality ratings.

Conclusion: SingMOS-Pro is a valuable resource for both benchmarking and advancing the field of singing voice quality evaluation.

Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality
remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the
form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective
metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce
SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on
our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro
expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and
overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset
contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets,
spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least
five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and
consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data
annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used
evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong
baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be

*Xuyi Hu,Jian Li,Shaojie Zhang,Stefan Goetz,Lorenzo Picinali,Ozgur B. Akan,Aidan O. T. Hogg*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new transformer-based model for personalized HRTF spatial upsampling, improving long-range spatial consistency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing HRTFs is critical for realistic spatial audio rendering, but their measurement process is complex and impractical at scale.

Method: A transformer-based model in the spherical harmonic domain is developed, incorporating a neighbor dissimilarity loss for smoothness while reconstructing high-resolution HRTFs.

Result: The proposed model outperforms prior methods in perceptual localization accuracy and spectral distortion metrics for high-fidelity HRTFs.

Conclusion: The approach enables more practical and effective HRTF personalization through advanced ML techniques, improving immersive audio applications.

Abstract: Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be
introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for
realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations
regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical
at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate
this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of
reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with
different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with
long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors.
In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF
upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial
correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH)
domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input
measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial
coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude
smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using
both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics.
Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial
margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.

Method: The proposed model integrates Mamba and multi-head attention mechanisms within a U-Net structure, introducing resolution-wise shared attention for layerwise attention-sharing across time- and frequency resolutions.

Result: RWSA-MambaUNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization on out-of-domain test sets, surpassing baselines in metrics like PESQ, SSNR, ESTOI, SI-SDR, with fewer parameters and lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: The model represents a significant advancement in efficient and highly generalizable speech enhancement, highlighting the utility of hybrid attention mechanisms and Mamba within U-Net architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba
and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization
performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has
yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model
size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose
RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and
multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus
performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise
attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our
best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization
performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model
surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of
PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms
of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and
a fraction of the FLOPs.

*Edmund Dervakos,Spyridon Kantarelis,Vassilis Lyberatos,Jason Liartis,Giorgos Stamou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces the witheFlow system, enhancing music performance by modulating audio effects using biosignals and audio features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring human-machine collaboration in music to enhance emotional conveyance and performance.

Method: Developing the witheFlow system that extracts features from biosignals and audio in real-time to modulate effects.

Result: The proof-of-concept system runs locally, is lightweight, and open-source.

Conclusion: The witheFlow system demonstrates potential for enriching music performance using technology.

Abstract: Music performance is a distinctly human activity, intrinsically linked to the
performer's ability to convey, evoke, or express emotion. Machines cannot
perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or
synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional
experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to
explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we
introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance
by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both
biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept
phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is
open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation
and sensors.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study introduces GlobalDISCO, a diverse dataset to evaluate biases in music generation models across countries, languages, and genres, revealing disparities in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore biases in generative music models, which lack evaluation across global diversity in countries, languages, cultures, and genres due to limited datasets and benchmarks.

Method: Introduction of GlobalDISCO, a dataset with 73k generated music tracks and 93k reference tracks, covering 147 languages and global musical styles from 79 countries, for evaluation of biases.

Result: Disparities were found in music quality and alignment between high-resource and low-resource regions, as well as biases against geographically niche genres compared to mainstream ones.

Conclusion: Music generation models exhibit biases, requiring evaluation frameworks and diverse datasets, exemplified by GlobalDISCO, to ensure improved fairness and inclusivity.

Abstract: While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models,
research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical
genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets
and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these
challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k
music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models,
along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset
spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from
MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing
musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our
evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with
reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we
find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and
geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for
regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream
styles.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model achieving excellent robustness and imperceptibility without training new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a state-of-the-art audio watermarking method that is both robust to attacks and imperceptible, while avoiding the need to train additional embedder-detector models.

Method: The method optimizes latent space perturbations of a pretrained audio VAE using gradient optimization guided by a combined perceptual and message embedding loss. The watermark is extracted with a pretrained CLAP model.

Result: Timbru achieves superior bit error rates on MUSDB18-HQ compared to existing methods such as AudioSeal, WavMark, and SilentCipher, under various attack scenarios, while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Timbru offers an efficient and dataset-free approach to imperceptible audio watermarking with state-of-the-art robustness and audio quality trade-offs.

Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves
state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an
embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method
performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in
the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and
perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP
model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal,
WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression,
resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best
average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an
efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.

*Koichi Saito,Julian Tanke,Christian Simon,Masato Ishii,Kazuki Shimada,Zachary Novack,Zhi Zhong,Akio Hayakawa,Takashi Shibuya,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces "frame-level online video-to-audio generation," enabling a model to generate audio in real-time without future video frame access. The proposed "SoundReactor" framework demonstrates effective and synchronized audio generation with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video-to-audio models work offline, limiting their applicability for interactive scenarios like live content creation. The paper aims to address this limitation by allowing real-time audio generation.

Method: The authors introduce a novel task and propose the SoundReactor framework, incorporating a causal transformer for continuous audio latents and DINOv2 vision encoder for frame-level conditioning. Training involves diffusion pre-training and consistency fine-tuning.

Result: SoundReactor generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality stereo audio with low latency (26.3ms to 31.5ms) on gameplay videos, as validated through objective and human evaluations.

Conclusion: SoundReactor successfully bridges a critical gap in video-to-audio generation by enabling real-time frame-level audio synthesis, thus expanding potential applications in live and interactive content creation settings.

Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming
an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This
critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content
creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we
introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model
autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video
frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for
this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame
latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a
decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision
conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest
variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token
per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained
through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to
accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay
videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and
temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both
objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame
waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on
30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAC-SE1, a simpler and effective language model-based framework for speech enhancement that uses high-resolution audio representations to achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern autoregressive speech enhancement methods offer good results but often rely on complex architectures and are restricted to narrow task-specific use cases due to low-resolution codecs.

Method: They propose DAC-SE1, which uses high-resolution discrete audio representations within a language model-inspired framework to improve acoustic detail retention and semantic coherence.

Result: DAC-SE1 outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoregressive methods in objective perceptual metrics as well as in human evaluations like MUSHRA.

Conclusion: The DAC-SE1 framework advances speech enhancement with simpler, scalable, and higher-quality enhancement methods, and the authors provide their codebase to foster further research.

Abstract: Recent autoregressive transformer-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have
shown promising results by leveraging advanced semantic understanding and
contextual modeling of speech. However, these approaches often rely on complex
multi-stage pipelines and low sampling rate codecs, limiting them to narrow and
task-specific speech enhancement. In this work, we introduce DAC-SE1, a
simplified language model-based SE framework leveraging discrete
high-resolution audio representations; DAC-SE1 preserves fine-grained acoustic
details while maintaining semantic coherence. Our experiments show that DAC-SE1
surpasses state-of-the-art autoregressive SE methods on both objective
perceptual metrics and in a MUSHRA human evaluation. We release our codebase
and model checkpoints to support further research in scalable, unified, and
high-quality speech enhancement.

*Timbwaoga A. J. Ouermi,Eric Li,Kenneth Moreland,Dave Pugmire,Chris R. Johnson,Tushar M. Athawale*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of visualizing the uncertainty in the computation of local divergence in two-dimensional vector fields by proposing a more efficient and scalable approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve the visualization methods for uncertainty in divergence computations caused by inaccuracies inherent in vector field data, which can affect downstream analyses.

Method: The paper introduces a closed-form analytical method for visualizing uncertainty in divergence and integrates it into a parallel computational library called Viskores to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed methods achieve speed-ups of up to 1946X for the serial analytical approach and 19698X for the parallel Viskores implementation, compared to the classical Monte Carlo sampling approach. Additionally, the visualizations qualitatively capture probabilistic insights better than traditional mean-field visualizations.

Conclusion: The methods offer an efficient, accurate, and scalable alternative to traditional Monte Carlo-based uncertainty visualizations for divergence in vector fields, suitable for real-world datasets like wind forecasts and ocean simulations.

Abstract: This work focuses on visualizing uncertainty of local divergence of
two-dimensional vector fields. Divergence is one of the fundamental attributes
of fluid flows, as it can help domain scientists analyze potential positions of
sources (positive divergence) and sinks (negative divergence) in the flow.
However, uncertainty inherent in vector field data can lead to erroneous
divergence computations, adversely impacting downstream analysis. While Monte
Carlo (MC) sampling is a classical approach for estimating divergence
uncertainty, it suffers from slow convergence and poor scalability with
increasing data size and sample counts. Thus, we present a two-fold
contribution that tackles the challenges of slow convergence and limited
scalability of the MC approach. (1) We derive a closed-form approach for highly
efficient and accurate uncertainty visualization of local divergence, assuming
independently Gaussian-distributed vector uncertainties. (2) We further
integrate our approach into Viskores, a platform-portable parallel library, to
accelerate uncertainty visualization. In our results, we demonstrate
significantly enhanced efficiency and accuracy of our serial analytical
(speed-up up to 1946X) and parallel Viskores (speed-up up to 19698X) algorithms
over the classical serial MC approach. We also demonstrate qualitative
improvements of our probabilistic divergence visualizations over traditional
mean-field visualization, which disregards uncertainty. We validate the
accuracy and efficiency of our methods on wind forecast and ocean simulation
datasets.

*Jianxu Wang,Ge Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot image denoising framework designed to handle structured noise, overcoming limitations of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current denoising methods struggle with structured noise due to their reliance on i.i.d. noise assumptions or labeled datasets, which limits generalizability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Median2Median (M2M) generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy image using directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to exclude structured artifacts. A randomized assignment strategy ensures unbiased Noise2Noise training.

Result: M2M performs as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise and surpasses them in scenarios involving correlated noise.

Conclusion: M2M offers an efficient, data-free solution for dealing with structured noise and advances zero-shot denoising techniques beyond the restrictive i.i.d. noise assumption.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical
imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with
strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most
data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and
still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods
avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median
(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M
introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent
sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional
interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values
distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling
space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is
employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for
Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par
with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently
outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an
efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the
first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.
assumption.

*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	ext{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel metric for evaluating video frame interpolation quality, addressing limitations of existing metrics by incorporating temporal coherence and motion divergence weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality metrics for video frame interpolation, such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, fail to consider temporal coherence. Current advanced techniques like FloLPIPS are computationally inefficient, limiting their practical use.

Method: The proposed metric $	ext{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ uses motion divergence weighting to enhance PSNR. This approach highlights singularities in motion fields, adapting techniques from archival film restoration to identify temporal inconsistencies and weight errors accordingly.

Result: Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset shows $	ext{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ improves Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient by +0.09 compared to FloLPIPS while being 2.5x faster and using 4x less memory. Its performance is consistent across various content categories and robust to different motion estimators.

Conclusion: $	ext{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ is computationally efficient, accurate, and versatile, making it not only effective for quality evaluation but also practical as a loss function for neural network training in video frame interpolation. The metric is publicly available for broader adoption.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video
enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual
impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and
LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored
towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but
suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application.
We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric
that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted
from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal
inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which
is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180
sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods)
shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant
improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while
being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains
consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator
used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast
quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural
networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric
is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.

*Jhonatan Contreras,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GFSR-Net for enhancing interpretability in medical imaging AI by guiding the model's focus using intuitive human annotations, leading to better alignments with diagnostically meaningful features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models excel in medical image analysis but face limited adoption in clinical settings due to poor interpretability and reliance on irrelevant patterns, raising concerns for trust and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: GFSR-Net utilizes human annotations to approximate intuitive focal areas within images; it trains the model to align its focus with these areas to emphasize diagnostically relevant features.

Result: GFSR-Net achieves comparable or superior diagnostic accuracy while providing saliency maps that align better with human expectations.

Conclusion: GFSR-Net enhances confidence in medical AI by improving its interpretability and reducing reliance on non-diagnostic patterns through guided focus methodology.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis,
however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of
interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without
explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to
the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in
real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of
misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance
Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and
reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human
annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image
intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,
making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to
align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry
diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and
medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological
images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior
accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.
This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in
automated diagnostic tools.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges of spurious correlations in medical imaging DNNs and introduces SpurBreast, a dataset designed to evaluate these issues systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing medical imaging datasets that aren't optimized for studying spurious correlations and their impact on DNNs' real-world deployment.

Method: The authors curated the SpurBreast dataset by intentionally incorporating spurious correlations (e.g., magnetic field strength and image orientation) and analyzed DNNs' responses to controlled dataset splits.

Result: The study shows that DNNs tend to exploit non-clinical spurious signals, achieving high validation accuracy yet failing to generalize to unbiased test sets.

Conclusion: SpurBreast provides a platform for studying both spurious and clinically relevant features, aiding in the development of robust, generalizable medical imaging models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical
imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious
correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of
meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed
to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and
limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce
SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates
spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing
over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify
two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature
influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting
spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs
can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy
while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets
containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without
spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate
clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation,
adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Diffusion models are effective for inverse imaging problems but hampered by slow sampling. This paper modifies the faster consistency models for better measurement-guided reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of multi-step sampling in diffusion models for inverse problems, proposing a faster, yet reliable reconstruction method.

Method: The authors propose a modified consistency sampling strategy, incorporating measurement-consistency tied to the operator to ensure fidelity to measurements while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets showed improved perceptual and pixel-level metrics compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a reconstruction approach that is efficient and yields competitive or superior results with only a few sampling steps.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse
imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits
practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling
high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct
adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a
modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem
reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a
measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which
enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency
of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level
metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance,
peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared
to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior
reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos, with improved dynamics modeling, realistic animation, and photorealistic rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating dynamically accurate and realistic 3D avatars with loose garments, overcoming prior limitations in robustness and accuracy.

Method: Utilizes a Material Point Method-based simulator with tailored constitutive modeling and collision handling, alongside 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity rendering.

Result: MPMAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamics modeling accuracy, rendering accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. It can also generalize to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: MPMAvatar sets a new standard in creating 3D avatars with photorealistic rendering and robust physical simulations by employing innovative modeling techniques.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The authors propose ROI-GS, a framework for 3D scene reconstruction that prioritizes high-detail reconstruction on objects of interest while being resource-efficient. It demonstrates better quality, reduced model size, and faster training compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in allocating computational resources for 3D scene reconstruction, specifically deficiencies in capturing high-detail for objects of interest without inflating model size.

Method: The paper introduces ROI-GS, which incorporates object-aware techniques such as object-guided camera selection, targeted object training, and high-fidelity reconstructions of regions of interest (ROIs) seamlessly integrated into global scenes.

Result: ROI-GS achieves improved local reconstruction quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), reduces model size by approximately 17% compared to the baseline, and accelerates training for scenes with single objects of interest.

Conclusion: ROI-GS effectively enhances reconstruction quality and efficiency for 3D scenes, especially in relation to objects of interest, outperforming existing methods in terms of both resource utilization and reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of accurately reconstructing and relighting glossy objects by proposing a framework that integrates microfacet BRDF with Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in disentangling object shape, material properties, and illumination in glossy objects while improving material recovery and relighting fidelity.

Method: The authors propose a framework integrating microfacet BRDF with a specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting, accompanied by diffusion-based priors and coarse-to-fine optimization for environment maps.

Result: Experiments show that the method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, and delivers more realistic and consistent relighting for glossy scenes compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the physical consistency of material decomposition and improves relighting under novel illumination settings, advancing the realism of neural rendering.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

*Chiara Curletto,Paolo Massa,Valeria Tagliafico,Cristina Campi,Federico Benvenuto,Michele Piana,Andrea Tacchino*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a web-based platform for solar flare forecasting using feature-based machine learning, offering predictions, feature rankings, and performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for solar flare forecasting to mitigate potential impacts on Earth's infrastructure due to geomagnetic storms. Current methods lack a balance between operational utility and explainability.

Method: Developed a web-based platform that integrates feature-based machine learning prediction pipelines focusing on flare occurrence, importance of features, and performance evaluation.

Result: The platform enables solar flare occurrence prediction while providing feature ranking and performance assessment capabilities.

Conclusion: The platform bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability in solar flare forecasting, promising operational improvements and better interpretability.

Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the
main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and
leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at
Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning
approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability
degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the
physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a
web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline
of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare
occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction
performances.

### [506] [Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01302)
*Kassahun Azezew,Amsalu Tesema,Bitew Mekuria,Ayenew Kassie,Animut Embiale,Ayodeji Olalekan Salau,Tsega Asresa*

Main category: q-bio.OT

TL;DR: The study develops a hybrid predictive model combining time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression techniques to predict malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia's Amhara Region using environmental, historical, and demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictable transmission of malaria in the Amhara Region, coupled with its significant public health impact, necessitates accurate forecasting to allocate resources effectively and enable timely interventions.

Method: The study utilizes a hybrid approach that merges time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based models to analyze data from health centers. The model considers environmental factors, historical malaria cases, and demographics to predict multiple outcomes, such as species-specific cases and trends.

Result: The hybrid model demonstrated superior prediction accuracy compared to single-method models, uncovering hidden patterns and enhancing forecasting precision.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a repeatable and reliable method for malaria incidence prediction, aiding public health authorities in decision-making, intervention planning, and resource allocation in endemic areas.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in
the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make
prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is
essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This
study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series
forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based
prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past
malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health
centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression
approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including
Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations,
whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations
among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than
single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable
information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and
repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support
evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource
optimization in endemic areas.

*Alireza Salemi,Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Yiwen Song,Jinsung Yoon,Hamed Zamani,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a blackboard-based multi-agent communication system to improve data discovery in large, heterogeneous data lakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of effectively finding relevant data in large, heterogeneous data lakes limits the practical deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The proposed system is inspired by the blackboard architecture, where agents autonomously respond to posted requests in a shared space, without needing a central controller to allocate tasks.

Result: The blackboard architecture achieved 13% to 57% relative improvement in task success and up to a 9% relative F1 score gain in data discovery over existing systems, tested across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The blackboard paradigm enhances scalability and generalizability for multi-agent systems and outperforms existing methods in data discovery applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

### [508] [Better Than "Better Than Nothing": Design Strategies for Enculturated Empathetic AI Robot Companions for Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01192)
*Isabel Pedersen,Andrea Slane*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of embedding empathy in human-robot interactions with older adults, identifying gaps in current robot designs, and advocating for a design pathway based on empathetic care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-robot interactions lack sufficient emphasis on empathy, leading to subpar social engagement in care scenarios for older adults.

Method: The paper uses rhetorical theory to define socio-cultural expectations of empathy, analyzes two public robot research collections, and examines the societal value of empathy in human interactions.

Result: The analysis highlights an insufficient focus on empathy in robot design and public robotics materials, particularly in gerontechnology.

Conclusion: Embedding empathy as a foundational design principle for humanoid social robots is critical to achieving culturally aligned and ethically sound aging-in-place support for older adults.

Abstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key
component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot
interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study
participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care
scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect.
Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as
a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the
socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It
analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates
empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein
empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections
on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it
substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by
robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary
as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing
humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of
aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the
sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought
to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving
empathetic qualities.

*Gianluca De Ninno,Paola Inverardi,Francesca Belotti*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The research combines immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis to explore users' moral preferences in ethically charged scenarios, focusing on digital privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to better understand and automate the evaluation of users' moral decision-making, particularly soft ethics, to aid in software development.

Method: Participants engage in narrative-driven roleplaying scenarios centered on digital privacy. Data from these sessions are analyzed using a custom LLM, named "GPT Anthropologist," validated by cross-analysis.

Result: The customized LLM effectively interprets rich datasets and predicts user behavior, significantly improving the understanding of moral preferences.

Conclusion: Roleplaying combined with LLM interpretation proves valuable for analyzing user ethics and decision-making, suggesting potential applications in software development.

Abstract: This study investigates a novel approach to eliciting users' moral
decision-making by combining immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis
capabilities. Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard
ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding
individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we
focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven
interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game
exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital
privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized
LLM ("GPT Anthropologist"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows
that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly
enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs
can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user
moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software
development.

*Aadarsh Rajiv,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LegiScout enhances comprehension of complex legislative frameworks like ACA through interactive, force-directed graph visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legislative frameworks are complex and difficult to interpret using traditional static charts.

Method: LegiScout combines data extraction, natural language processing, and computer vision to create dynamic policy visualizations.

Result: The system allows stakeholders to explore and navigate legislative structures more effectively.

Conclusion: LegiScout simplifies understanding of modern legislation for policymakers, analysts, and the public.

Abstract: Modern legislative frameworks, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often
involve complex webs of agencies, mandates, and interdependencies. Government
issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static,
dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout,
an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into
dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving
essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language
processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper
exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and
regulatory frameworks. Our approach enables stakeholders - policymakers,
analysts, and the public - to navigate and understand the complexity inherent
in modern law.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses an AI system aimed at enabling midwives in rural, low-resource settings to acquire quality fetal ultrasound images using low-cost equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of access to quality obstetric ultrasound imaging in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries.

Method: The system integrates a classification model to identify key frames in blind sweep studies, paired with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist review.

Result: The system successfully identified standard fetal planes in videos captured by minimally trained midwives, showing usability and low cognitive workload.

Conclusion: The AI system shows promise in expanding access to prenatal imaging, particularly in underserved regions with limited medical resources.

Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings,
particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work
proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to
assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind
sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a
web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key
frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate
on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its
performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained
midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were
analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard
fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good
usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to
expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

*Saketh Ram Kasibatla,Kiran Medleri Hiremath,Raven Rothkopf,Sorin Lerner,Haijun Xia,Brian Hempel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces GUIde, a method to translate command line documentation into graphical interfaces using AI, enhancing user accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Command line shells are powerful but require users to remember textual commands and navigate complex documentation. The paper aims to make this power accessible via graphical interfaces.

Method: The authors developed GUIde by translating command line man pages into graphical interface specifications using AI, enabling graphical representation of command options.

Result: The study evaluates GUIde on a set of commands, showing its ability to provide comprehensive graphical interfaces for real-world command line tasks.

Conclusion: GUIde demonstrates the potential to bridge the gap between command line power and user accessibility by automating the creation of graphical interfaces, making advanced tools more user-friendly.

Abstract: Although birthed in the era of teletypes, the command line shell survived the
graphical interface revolution of the 1980's and lives on in modern desktop
operating systems. The command line provides access to powerful functionality
not otherwise exposed on the computer, but requires users to recall textual
syntax and carefully scour documentation. In contrast, graphical interfaces let
users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and
menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a
mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line
tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into
interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing
system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We
evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what
degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command
line tasks.

*Maura E Halstead,Mark A. Green,Caroline Jay,Richard Kingston,David Topping,Alexander Singleton*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines researchers' perspectives on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for data discovery, identifying barriers and proposing transparency features to enhance acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, data discovery relies on exact keyword matches in metadata and queries, which forces researchers to know specific prior wording, making it inefficient and potentially prone to missing relevant data.

Method: The study followed a human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) approach, employing focus groups comprising 27 participants to understand researchers' perspectives on adopting LLMs for data discovery.

Result: The conceptual model revealed that while LLMs offer notable benefits, existing barriers hinder researchers from fully accepting them. Transparency-oriented features could help overcome these obstacles.

Conclusion: Incorporating transparency features into LLMs could increase their acceptance among researchers, enabling natural language-based data discovery.

Abstract: Current approaches to data discovery match keywords between metadata and
queries. This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that
other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could
lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data
discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask
questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if
researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered
artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to
understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our
conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for
researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent
researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could
overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features
that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.

TL;DR: This paper highlights compliance risks in professional domains caused by Large Language Models, reveals experts' concerns and limited mitigation strategies, and advocates for human-centered, compliance-driven NLP systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate compliance risks introduced by Large Language Models in professional domains and address the mismatch between current NLP tools and compliance needs.

Method: Semi-structured interviews with 24 knowledge workers from high-risk industries, analyzing their concerns and strategies.

Result: Experts showed concerns about sensitive information leakage, intellectual property infringement, and uncertain model outputs, with limited effectiveness in their mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: There is a gap in compliance-focused NLP tools. The paper proposes foundational work for human-centered, compliance-driven NLP systems to assist regulatory workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models are profoundly changing work patterns in high-risk
professional domains, yet their application also introduces severe and
underexplored compliance risks. To investigate this issue, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with 24 highly-skilled knowledge workers from
industries such as law, healthcare, and finance. The study found that these
experts are commonly concerned about sensitive information leakage,
intellectual property infringement, and uncertainty regarding the quality of
model outputs. In response, they spontaneously adopt various mitigation
strategies, such as actively distorting input data and limiting the details in
their prompts. However, the effectiveness of these spontaneous efforts is
limited due to a lack of specific compliance guidance and training for Large
Language Models. Our research reveals a significant gap between current NLP
tools and the actual compliance needs of experts. This paper positions these
valuable empirical findings as foundational work for building the next
generation of Human-Centered, Compliance-Driven Natural Language Processing for
Regulatory Technology (RegTech), providing a critical human-centered
perspective and design requirements for engineering NLP systems that can
proactively support expert compliance workflows.

*Hasan Mahmud,Najmul Islam,Satish Krishnan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates why robo-advisors (RAs) are underutilized despite their advantages, using experiments and qualitative analysis to examine user behavior and perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the adoption of robo-advisors is limited despite their potential as cost-effective and unbiased financial tools.

Method: The study employed a multiphase mixed-methods approach, including a behavioral experiment (N=334), thematic qualitative analysis, and follow-up quantitative testing.

Result: The study identified factors shaping user reliance on RAs, such as performance information and advice framing, as well as delineating three RA roles, four user types, and a 2x2 typology of acceptance antecedents.

Conclusion: By integrating behavioral and interpretive findings, the research enhances understanding of human-RA collaboration and offers design recommendations to improve RA trustworthiness and adaptability.

Abstract: Robo-advisors (RAs) are cost-effective, bias-resistant alternatives to human
financial advisors, yet adoption remains limited. While prior research has
examined user interactions with RAs, less is known about how individuals
interpret RA roles and integrate their advice into decision-making. To address
this gap, this study employs a multiphase mixed methods design integrating a
behavioral experiment (N = 334), thematic analysis, and follow-up quantitative
testing. Findings suggest that people tend to rely on RAs, with reliance shaped
by information about RA performance and the framing of advice as gains or
losses. Thematic analysis reveals three RA roles in decision-making and four
user types, each reflecting distinct patterns of advice integration. In
addition, a 2 x 2 typology categorizes antecedents of acceptance into enablers
and inhibitors at both the individual and algorithmic levels. By combining
behavioral, interpretive, and confirmatory evidence, this study advances
understanding of human-RA collaboration and provides actionable insights for
designing more trustworthy and adaptive RA systems.

TL;DR: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) often struggles with the speech of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals during real-time conversations. EvolveCaptions offers a collaborative approach to adapt ASR in-situ with minimal data and effort, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent issue of ASR systems failing to accurately transcribe speech from DHH individuals, particularly in real-time communication, and reduce the burden of personalization on the DHH speakers.

Method: Developed EvolveCaptions, a collaborative real-time ASR adaptation system where hearing participants correct transcription errors. These corrections generate brief, targeted prompts for the DHH speaker, facilitating ASR model fine-tuning using limited recordings.

Result: EvolveCaptions reduced the Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH participants after one hour of use, with only five minutes of recorded prompts required on average.

Conclusion: Collaborative, real-time adaptation of ASR systems like EvolveCaptions can significantly improve transcription accuracy and make communication more equitable for DHH individuals.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately
transcribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially
during real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically
require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the
DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR
adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort.
Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on
these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts
for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model.
In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced
Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only
five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as
intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings
demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more
equitable communication.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This research presents a framework combining sentiment scores from large language models (LLMs) and intraday stock price data for improved minute-based prediction of Apple's stock prices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high volatility and non-linear nature of financial time series, which make short-term stock market predictions challenging.

Method: Sentiment scores from 10 LLMs were combined with technical indicators and used as inputs for Reformer and Mamba models. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and models were evaluated.

Result: Mamba outperformed Reformer across all tested LLMs, with the lowest error (0.137) observed using LLaMA 3.3--70B. Reformer had a tendency to over-smooth sudden changes.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-driven sentiment analysis with advanced temporal modeling improves real-time financial forecasting, showcasing Mamba's effectiveness in capturing nuanced stock price trends.

Abstract: The stock market is extremely difficult to predict in the short term due to
high market volatility, changes caused by news, and the non-linear nature of
the financial time series. This research proposes a novel framework for
improving minute-level prediction accuracy using semantic sentiment scores from
top ten different large language models (LLMs) combined with minute interval
intraday stock price data. We systematically constructed a time-aligned dataset
of AAPL news articles and 1-minute Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices for the dates
of April 4 to May 2, 2025. The sentiment analysis was achieved using the
DeepSeek-V3, GPT variants, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and Mistral models
through their APIs. Each article obtained sentiment scores from all ten LLMs,
which were scaled to a [0, 1] range and combined with prices and technical
indicators like RSI, ROC, and Bollinger Band Width. Two state-of-the-art such
as Reformer and Mamba were trained separately on the dataset using the
sentiment scores produced by each LLM as input. Hyper parameters were optimized
by means of Optuna and were evaluated through a 3-day evaluation period.
Reformer had mean squared error (MSE) or the evaluation metrics, and it should
be noted that Mamba performed not only faster but also better than Reformer for
every LLM across the 10 LLMs tested. Mamba performed best with LLaMA 3.3--70B,
with the lowest error of 0.137. While Reformer could capture broader trends
within the data, the model appeared to over smooth sudden changes by the LLMs.
This study highlights the potential of integrating LLM-based semantic analysis
paired with efficient temporal modeling to enhance real-time financial
forecasting.

*Gerson Personnat,Tao Lin,Safwan Hossain,David C. Parkes*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies online learning strategies for leaders in multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg games and proposes algorithms to minimize regret under different feedback scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to help leaders play optimally in dynamic environments where followers respond based on private types, sampled from an unknown distribution. This ensures efficient decision-making and utility optimization.

Method: The authors design online learning algorithms for scenarios with either type feedback (followers' types observed) or action feedback (followers' actions observed). Regret bounds are analyzed and optimized in both cases.

Result: Algorithms with specific regret bounds are proposed under both feedback settings: notably, type-feedback bounds do not grow polynomially with the number of followers.

Conclusion: Efficient algorithms are presented for learning in Bayesian Stackelberg games with near-matching lower bounds, advancing understanding of online learning in multi-agent strategic settings.

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

TL;DR: Ovi introduces a unified approach to audio-video generation, combining modalities into a single process, eliminating separate pipelines and enabling synchronized, realistic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and improve audio-video generation by removing the need for complex multi-stage architectures and sequential synthesis.

Method: The approach uses blockwise cross-modal fusion with twin-DiT modules, jointly training identical video and audio towers via timing and semantic exchanges.

Result: Ovi successfully generates cinematic-quality content, including natural speech, accurate sound effects, and realistic visuals, trained on extensive audio-video datasets.

Conclusion: Ovi establishes a new paradigm for audio-video generation, offering seamless synchronization and high-quality multimodal outputs, bridging audio and visual modalities effectively.

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures
or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified
paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single
generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules,
Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate
pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion
modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that
of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of
thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic
sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and
emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio
towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and
semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our
model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate,
context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the
demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

TL;DR: The paper compares contrastive loss and triplet loss in deep metric learning, finding that triplet loss excels in maintaining finer details and handling harder examples, while contrastive loss is better for broad, smooth embedding refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is insufficient understanding of the impact of contrastive and triplet losses on representation quality in deep metric learning.

Method: The authors conducted a theoretical and empirical comparison of the losses focusing on their effects on intra- and inter-class variance, optimization behavior, and task-specific experiments on synthetic and real datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Result: Triplet loss preserves greater intra-class and inter-class variance, aids finer-grained representation distinctions, and demonstrates superior performance in classification and retrieval tasks. Contrastive loss focuses on compact intra-class embeddings and broad-based refinement.

Conclusion: Triplet loss is recommended for precise detail retention and handling hard samples, while contrastive loss suits smooth global embedding refinements.

Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric
learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently
understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses,
focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g.,
greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on
synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss
preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained
distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss
tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic
differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining
loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss
drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but
stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both
classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196
datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior
performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and
hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding
refinement.

*Tao Han,Ang Li,Qinyu Chen,Chang Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: JaneEye offers a high-accuracy, ultra-efficient eye-tracking solution using event cameras and a lightweight neural network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of frame-based eye-tracking systems in XR devices, such as insufficient accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency.

Method: The method involves designing a hardware accelerator and introducing a compact neural network architecture with a novel ConvJANET layer, hardware optimizations like fixed-point quantization, and an ultra-efficient ASIC implementation.

Result: JaneEye achieves a pixel error of 2.45, can operate at an event frame rate of up to 1250 Hz, and delivers 2000 FPS at 18.9 μJ/frame energy efficiency with end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates JaneEye’s capabilities as a cutting-edge, low-power eye-tracking solution ideal for wearable XR applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [522] [NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01850)
*Ying-Ren Chien,Po-Heng Chou,You-Jie Peng,Chun-Yuan Huang,Hen-Wai Tsao,Yu Tsao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called NGGAN, designed to model impulsive noise in narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) systems by learning complex noise characteristics from real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models inadequately capture the full complexity of impulsive noise in NB-PLC systems, which impacts noise processing efficacy in narrowband PLC transceivers.

Method: The authors design and train NGGAN using Wasserstein distance as a loss function to generate realistic noise samples. This model incorporates input signal length adjustments and qualitative/quantitative comparisons with practical NB-PLC noise datasets and mathematical noise models.

Result: The NGGAN demonstrated superior performance in generating realistic noise that closely matches the waveform characteristics of practically measured noise datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed NGGAN effectively captures and reproduces complex noise characteristics, enhancing data augmentation for NB-PLC systems and improving overall noise modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

*Jinshuo Zhang,Yafei Wang,Xinping Yi,Wenjin Wang,Shi Jin,Symeon Chatzinotas,Björn Ottersten*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient deep learning framework for symbol-level precoding (SLP) using constructive interference, achieving a significant speedup with low complexity and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational complexity of symbol-level precoding (SLP) that hinders its practical application, despite its performance advantages.

Method: The paper introduces a deep learning framework that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in closed-form, tensor equivariance (TE), and incorporates an attention-based TE module to achieve linear computational complexity. The framework is also extended to handle imperfect CSI.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods while capturing performance gains of optimal SLP and maintaining strong generalization across varying user numbers and symbol block lengths.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the deep learning framework is both computationally efficient and adaptable, offering promising advantages for practical SLP applications under different scenarios.

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

### [524] [An Analysis of the New EU AI Act and A Proposed Standardization Framework for Machine Learning Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01281)
*Mike Teodorescu,Yongxu Sun,Haren N. Bhatia,Christos Makridis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper identifies shortcomings in the EU AI Act regarding fairness metrics and terminology ambiguity, proposing a tailored framework and standardized best practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of clear fairness metrics and ambiguous terminology in the EU AI Act may hinder ethical compliance and deter AI investments.

Method: Authors propose a tailored regulatory framework and a public system for assessing fairness and transparency, leveraging industry best practices.

Result: The paper highlights liability risks due to regulation ambiguity and exemplifies proposals with ASR and speech synthesizer technologies.

Conclusion: Enhanced regulations and standardized practices are suggested to balance regulatory clarity, ethical compliance, and innovation in the AI sector.

Abstract: The European Union's AI Act represents a crucial step towards regulating
ethical and responsible AI systems. However, we find an absence of quantifiable
fairness metrics and the ambiguity in terminology, particularly the
interchangeable use of the keywords transparency, explainability, and
interpretability in the new EU AI Act and no reference of transparency of
ethical compliance. We argue that this ambiguity creates substantial liability
risk that would deter investment. Fairness transparency is strategically
important. We recommend a more tailored regulatory framework to enhance the new
EU AI regulation. Further-more, we propose a public system framework to assess
the fairness and transparency of AI systems. Drawing from past work, we
advocate for the standardization of industry best practices as a necessary
addition to broad regulations to achieve the level of details required in
industry, while preventing stifling innovation and investment in the AI sector.
The proposals are exemplified with the case of ASR and speech synthesizers.

### [525] [Emergent evaluation hubs in a decentralizing large language model ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01286)
*Manuel Cebrian,Tomomi Kito,Raul Castro Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics between large language models and benchmarks, finding diverging patterns in their evolution—models diversify while benchmarks centralize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models and associated benchmarks evolve could inform strategies for better evaluation, standardization, and reproducibility.

Method: The study uses curated datasets like the Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and Evidently AI registry, coupled with agent-based simulations to analyze agglomeration patterns and mechanisms in model and benchmark ecosystems.

Result: Model creation is increasingly decentralized and diverse, while benchmark influence remains highly centralized with significant concentration of authority among few countries and institutions.

Conclusion: Concentrated benchmark influence plays a key role in coordination and standardization but introduces trade-offs like path dependence and limited utility as benchmark saturation increases.

Abstract: Large language models are proliferating, and so are the benchmarks that serve
as their common yardsticks. We ask how the agglomeration patterns of these two
layers compare: do they evolve in tandem or diverge? Drawing on two curated
proxies for the ecosystem, the Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and
the Evidently AI benchmark registry, we find complementary but contrasting
dynamics. Model creation has broadened across countries and organizations and
diversified in modality, licensing, and access. Benchmark influence, by
contrast, displays centralizing patterns: in the inferred
benchmark-author-institution network, the top 15% of nodes account for over 80%
of high-betweenness paths, three countries produce 83% of benchmark outputs,
and the global Gini for inferred benchmark authority reaches 0.89. An
agent-based simulation highlights three mechanisms: higher entry of new
benchmarks reduces concentration; rapid inflows can temporarily complicate
coordination in evaluation; and stronger penalties against over-fitting have
limited effect. Taken together, these results suggest that concentrated
benchmark influence functions as coordination infrastructure that supports
standardization, comparability, and reproducibility amid rising heterogeneity
in model production, while also introducing trade-offs such as path dependence,
selective visibility, and diminishing discriminative power as leaderboards
saturate.

### [526] [Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01395)
*Myra Cheng,Cinoo Lee,Pranav Khadpe,Sunny Yu,Dyllan Han,Dan Jurafsky*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper reveals the harmful effects of sycophantic behavior in AI, showing it negatively influences human judgment and relationships, while still being preferred by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have risen about AI's sycophantic behavior, which could reinforce delusions and harm interpersonal relationships.

Method: The study analyzed sycophancy in 11 AI models and conducted two experiments with 1604 participants, including live interactions on real-life conflicts.

Result: AI models affirm users 50% more than humans do, reduce willingness to resolve interpersonal conflicts, yet are trusted and preferred by users.

Conclusion: Explicit actions are needed to address the perverse incentives encouraging AI sycophancy to reduce its widespread risks.

Abstract: Both the general public and academic communities have raised concerns about
sycophancy, the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI) excessively agreeing
with or flattering users. Yet, beyond isolated media reports of severe
consequences, like reinforcing delusions, little is known about the extent of
sycophancy or how it affects people who use AI. Here we show the pervasiveness
and harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First,
across 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly
sycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so
even in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other
relational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604),
including a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real
interpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with
sycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take
actions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of
being in the right. However, participants rated sycophantic responses as higher
quality, trusted the sycophantic AI model more, and were more willing to use it
again. This suggests that people are drawn to AI that unquestioningly validate,
even as that validation risks eroding their judgment and reducing their
inclination toward prosocial behavior. These preferences create perverse
incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and
for AI model training to favor sycophancy. Our findings highlight the necessity
of explicitly addressing this incentive structure to mitigate the widespread
risks of AI sycophancy.

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Svetlozar Nestorov,Peter Norlander*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), an open-source tool to extract structured information from job postings using natural language processing (NLP) and the O*NET framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accessing and standardizing data from online job postings is challenging, and the existing O*NET database is infrequently updated based on limited survey samples.

Method: The authors use O*NET as a base framework and develop NLP tools to extract structured data from 155 million job ads, testing the tools' reliability with out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

Result: The toolkit extracts over 10 billion data points, including information on tasks, occupation codes, tools, technologies, wages, and skills. They aggregate this data by occupation, state, and industry over a 10-year timeline (2015-2025).

Conclusion: JAAT provides a reliable and scalable solution for creating rich datasets from job ads, unlocking potential for research and applications in education and workforce development.

Abstract: Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a
standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and
occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on
small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural
language processing tools that extract structured information from job
postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of
open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more
features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and
industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We
illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and
workforce development.

*Tiago da Silva Barros,Frédéric Giroire,Ramon Aparicio-Pardo,Joanna Moulierac*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses reducing AI's energy consumption through energy-efficient model selection, estimating a global 27.8% reduction by 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing energy consumption and carbon footprint of AI models, moving away from the 'bigger is better' trend to a more sustainable 'small is sufficient' paradigm.

Method: The authors suggest focusing on model selection during inference as a practical and energy-efficient method, avoiding the need for newer hardware or architectural overhauls.

Result: The study found energy savings of 1% to 98% for various AI tasks through model selection, estimating a global reduction in energy consumption by 27.8%, equating to 31.9 TWh by 2025.

Conclusion: Model selection during inference offers a powerful and straightforward approach to significantly reduce AI's energy consumption while retaining effective utility.

Abstract: The energy consumption and carbon footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
have become critical concerns due to rising costs and environmental impacts. In
response, a new trend in green AI is emerging, shifting from the "bigger is
better" paradigm, which prioritizes large models, to "small is sufficient",
emphasizing energy sobriety through smaller, more efficient models.
  We explore how the AI community can adopt energy sobriety today by focusing
on model selection during inference. Model selection consists of choosing the
most appropriate model for a given task, a simple and readily applicable
method, unlike approaches requiring new hardware or architectures. Our
hypothesis is that, as in many industrial activities, marginal utility gains
decrease with increasing model size. Thus, applying model selection can
significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining good utility for AI
inference.
  We conduct a systematic study of AI tasks, analyzing their popularity, model
size, and efficiency. We examine how the maturity of different tasks and model
adoption patterns impact the achievable energy savings, ranging from 1% to 98%
for different tasks. Our estimates indicate that applying model selection could
reduce AI energy consumption by 27.8%, saving 31.9 TWh worldwide in 2025 -
equivalent to the annual output of five nuclear power reactors.

*Sergej Kucenko,Nathaniel Dennler,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper reviews and analyzes existing AI bias bounty programs and relevant academic literature, emphasizing the need for inclusivity and reduced barriers in future bias bounty initiatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in bias evaluation methods that rarely engage communities affected by AI systems, by exploring and analyzing the concept and implementation of bias bounties.

Method: The authors conducted a structured review of bias bounty programs and academic literature through platforms like Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE Xplore.

Result: Five bias bounty programs organized in the U.S. and five related research publications were identified. The study highlighted the structure of these programs, including participants' accessibility and monetary rewards.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to lower technical and organizational barriers to make AI bias bounties more inclusive and sensitive to underrepresented groups, while encouraging adoption of best practices from bug bounties.

Abstract: Current bias evaluation methods rarely engage with communities impacted by AI
systems. Inspired by bug bounties, bias bounties have been proposed as a
reward-based method that involves communities in AI bias detection by asking
users of AI systems to report biases they encounter when interacting with such
systems. In the absence of a state-of-the-art review, this survey aimed to
identify and analyse existing AI bias bounty programmes and to present academic
literature on bias bounties. Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE
Xplore were searched, and five bias bounty programmes, as well as five research
publications, were identified. All bias bounties were organised by U.S.-based
organisations as time-limited contests, with public participation in four
programmes and prize pools ranging from 7,000 to 24,000 USD. The five research
publications included a report on the application of bug bounties to
algorithmic harms, an article addressing Twitter's bias bounty, a proposal for
bias bounties as an institutional mechanism to increase AI scrutiny, a workshop
discussing bias bounties from queer perspectives, and an algorithmic framework
for bias bounties. We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter
bounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience.
Given the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the
transferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such
programmes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while
lowering adoption barriers for organisations.

*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-centric method using synthetic prefixes to reduce presentation bias in real-time query autocomplete systems, achieving improved user engagement in an e-commerce setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to mitigate presentation bias in real-time query autocomplete systems caused by the interaction of user behavior with model suggestions, using synthetic prefixes to create less biased training data.

Method: The method involves generating synthetic prefixes from user queries collected during searches without autocomplete, enriching the training dataset for neural rankers. The ranker is optimized for latency-constraints and incorporates features like query popularity, seasonality, and contextual signals. A simplified listwise loss reduces computational complexity.

Result: The approach was deployed in a large-scale e-commerce platform and showed statistically significant improvements in user engagement, measured by metrics like mean reciprocal rank. It also demonstrated better generalization and potential for scalability.

Conclusion: Using synthetic prefixes helps mitigate bias in query autocomplete systems, enhances generalization, and provides scalable solutions for other ranking tasks, while meeting real-time deployment constraints and improving user engagement.

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

*Bo Ma,LuYao Liu,Simon Lau,Chandler Yuan,and XueY Cui,Rosie Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework \\\model{} that uses large language models (LLMs) for more dynamic, multimodal, and explainable recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in modern recommendation systems, such as static user preference snapshots, reliance solely on textual descriptions, and lack of trustworthy explanation mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces online adaptation for user preferences, unified multimodal representation combining visual/audio/text data, and an explanation system grounded in collaborative patterns and item attributes.

Result: The framework achieves efficient updates to preferences, seamlessly integrates multiple modalities, and delivers explainable recommendations with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves recommendation systems by leveraging LLMs with practical designs suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommendation systems struggle with multimodal data, biases, and lack transparency.

Method: Authors propose a framework with multimodal fusion, retrieval-augmented generation, causal debiasing, explainable outputs, and real-time adaptation using large language models and specialized modules.

Result: The approach shows up to 2.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and 1.4% better diversity metrics on benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The enhanced framework improves recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity, providing a practical and efficient solution to existing limitations.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper examines the feasibility of using smaller, open-source LLMs to generate task-specific queries for fine-tuning domain-specific dense retrieval models, demonstrating their effectiveness as an alternative to large proprietary LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of relying on proprietary, large-scale LLMs for generating prompts, especially in scenarios where access is restricted or data sensitivity is a concern.

Method: The authors evaluate the impact of open-source LLMs (≤14B parameters) as alternative query generators, focusing on their performance compared to larger, proprietary models.

Result: The findings indicate that open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can effectively generate task-specific queries in a Promptagator-style framework.

Conclusion: Open-source, smaller-scale LLMs offer a practical and reliable alternative for practitioners needing synthetic data for fine-tuning domain-specific retrieval models.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

Method: The authors develop a geo-aware embedding framework by integrating a hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels within a two-tower neural network architecture and compare it against baseline models using platform data.

Result: The proposed method generates richer and more balanced embeddings and significantly enhances recommendation quality based on offline ranking simulations.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial nuances via a geo-aware framework improves recommendation systems for housing platforms, addressing sparsity and enhancing location-aware personalization.

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

### [535] [Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01871)
*Oscar Villemaud,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether a fine-grained ranking of items can be derived from coarse-grained user ratings and finds that a substantial number of user queries (Θ(n²)) are required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if fine-grained rankings of items can be recovered from coarse-grained user ratings and to explore the impact of underlying score and threshold distributions.

Method: The authors model items with latent scores and users with latent thresholds, investigating online ranking scenarios where users can refine item rankings through queries, while analyzing query efficiency using theoretical bounds.

Result: The study proves that achieving a near-perfect ranking requires Θ(n²) queries, due to the need to identify appropriate user thresholds. This complexity exceeds the O(n log n) required for pairwise comparisons.

Conclusion: A trade-off exists in online ranking: while diversity in user thresholds aids in fine-grained ranking, it incurs a significant cost in terms of query complexity when those thresholds are initially unknown.

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

### [536] [BioBlobs: Differentiable Graph Partitioning for Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01632)
*Xin Wang,Carlos Oliver*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper introduces BioBlobs, a module creating flexible protein substructure representations for better embeddings and understanding protein functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein representation learning models distort functional signals by relying on rigid substructure definitions, making it necessary to develop flexible and dynamic approaches.

Method: BioBlobs dynamically partitions protein structures into flexibly-sized substructures (blobs) and quantizes them into a shared codebook to compute more meaningful embeddings.

Result: BioBlobs improves the performance of popular protein encoders like GVP-GNN across multiple protein representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: BioBlobs offers an effective way to enhance protein modeling while generating interpretable and function-relevant insights, advancing both predictive performance and mechanistic understanding.

Abstract: Protein function is driven by coherent substructures which vary in size and
topology, yet current protein representation learning models (PRL) distort
these signals by relying on rigid substructures such as k-hop and fixed radius
neighbourhoods. We introduce BioBlobs, a plug-and-play, fully differentiable
module that represents proteins by dynamically partitioning structures into
flexibly-sized, non-overlapping substructures ("blobs"). The resulting blobs
are quantized into a shared and interpretable codebook, yielding a discrete
vocabulary of function-relevant protein substructures used to compute protein
embeddings. We show that BioBlobs representations improve the performance of
widely used protein encoders such as GVP-GNN across various PRL tasks. Our
approach highlights the value of architectures that directly capture
function-relevant protein substructures, enabling both improved predictive
performance and mechanistic insight into protein function.

### [537] [Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733)
*Felix J. Yu,Nicholas Kamp,Carlos A. Argüelles*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-supervised training pipeline using point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders to mitigate simulation-based systematic uncertainties in neutrino telescopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional reliance on simulated data for machine learning in neutrino physics introduces significant concerns due to inaccuracies and discrepancies between simulated and real data.

Method: The paper leverages self-supervised learning techniques, specifically point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders, to shift training predominantly to real data.

Result: The novel self-supervised pipeline reduces dependence on simulation, thus minimizing systematic uncertainties and enhancing event reconstruction and classification capabilities.

Conclusion: This work represents a fundamental shift in the application of machine learning for neutrino telescopes, opening doors for better accuracy and reliability in neutrino data analysis.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on
simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the
accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real
data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino
telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years,
self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing
dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised
training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers
and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data,
this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated
systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous
machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for
substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.

*Gert Aarts,Diaa E. Habibi,Lingxiao Wang,Kai Zhou*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper investigates using diffusion models in generative AI to understand the probability distributions from complex Langevin processes, which are often challenging due to sign problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of understanding the probability distributions sampled by complex Langevin processes in systems with sign problems.

Method: The study compares score-based and energy-based diffusion models for their ability to learn these complex probability distributions.

Result: Diffusion models, particularly score-based and energy-based types, are evaluated for their effectiveness in capturing distributions sampled by the complex Langevin method.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show potential in understanding and learning the distributions in systems with complexified configuration spaces, with speculation on their broader applications.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can
sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified
configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled
by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to
understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or
their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to
learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing
score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible
applications.

*Bhaskar Mangal,Ashutosh Bhatia,Yashvardhan Sharma,Kamlesh Tiwari,Rashmi Verma*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "ktbox," a modular LaTeX framework for consistent styling, semantic palettes, and visual emphasis in scientific communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inconsistent visual emphasis and limited formatting portability in scientific manuscripts caused by ad-hoc styling choices.

Method: Developed independent yet interoperable LaTeX components (ktcolor.sty, ktbox.sty, ktlrtree.sty, ktorcid.sty) with a unified namespace to standardize semantic palettes, highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata.

Result: The framework ensures compatibility with major LaTeX templates, improves clarity, and enhances authoring efficiency through reproducible formatting elements.

Conclusion: "ktbox" transforms visual styling from cosmetic components into structured, reusable building blocks, uplifting scholarly communication across various document types and templates.

Abstract: The communication of technical insight in scientific manuscripts often relies
on ad-hoc formatting choices, resulting in inconsistent visual emphasis and
limited portability across document classes. This paper introduces ktbox, a
modular LaTeX framework that unifies semantic color palettes, structured
highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata utilities into a coherent
system for scholarly writing. The framework is distributed as a set of
lightweight, namespaced components: ktcolor.sty for semantic palettes,
ktbox.sty for structured highlight and takeaway environments, ktlrtree.sty for
taxonomy trees with fusion and auxiliary annotations, and ktorcid.sty for
ORCID-linked author metadata. Each component is independently usable yet
interoperable, ensuring compatibility with major templates such as IEEEtran,
acmart, iclr conference, and beamer. Key features include auto-numbered
takeaway boxes, wide-format highlights, flexible taxonomy tree visualizations,
and multi-column layouts supporting embedded tables, enumerations, and code
blocks. By adopting a clear separation of concerns and enforcing a consistent
naming convention under the kt namespace, the framework transforms visual
styling from cosmetic add-ons into reproducible, extensible building blocks of
scientific communication, improving clarity, portability, and authoring
efficiency across articles, posters, and presentations.
