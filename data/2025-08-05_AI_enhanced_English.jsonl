To alleviate\nthis annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)\nhas emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization\nperformance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack\nexternal semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,\nwe propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that\nintroduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using\nonly image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic\nknowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly\nextracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive\nvision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features\nthrough mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.\nSubsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,\nwhere the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head\ngenerates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak\nsupervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch\nconsistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating\nauthentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially\noutperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in\nboth detection and localization accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces ViLaCo, a framework for weakly supervised image forgery localization, leveraging vision-language models to achieve pixel-level accuracy using only image-level labels.", "motivation": "To overcome the limitations of current weakly supervised methods for image forgery localization, which lack external semantic guidance and rely heavily on intra-image consistency clues.", "method": "ViLaCo utilizes pre-trained vision-language models to extract semantic knowledge and align textual semantics with visual features via a reasoning network.

Empirical results indicate that this iterative\nreward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion\nmodels to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and\nenhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed\nframework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,\nresulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and\nover 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil\ndesign.
