By\nleveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,\nZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the\nLLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the\nZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical\nsolution for real-world deployments.
