### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how autonomous agents use communication to develop culture, improve efficiency, and transmit behaviors across generations using the NEC-DAC system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how communication strategies enable self-organized cultural development and impact team efficiency in autonomous agents.

Method: The NEC-DAC system, equipping agents with neural networks, is used to study the development of shared behavior and the influence of communication strategies across various social structures.

Result: Agents demonstrate culture formation and improved cooperation, with communication playing a significant role in their coordination and cultural transmission.

Conclusion: The emergence and transmission of culture in autonomous systems through communication enhances tribal performance and cooperation.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates strategic randomization in large language models (LLMs) through a zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, evaluating their ability to use randomness strategically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore and evaluate the strategic decision-making and randomization abilities of LLMs, as these aspects are underdeveloped in current models.

Method: The authors propose a zero-sum game with Nash equilibrium as the maximal entropy strategy and test five LLMs using different prompt styles to assess their ability to decide to randomize under competitive conditions.

Result: Weaker models show deterministic behavior despite prompts, while stronger models randomize more when given explicit hints but resort to deterministic strategies against weaker opponents. Strong models converge to equilibrium strategies with equal peers.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit varying strategic reasoning capabilities, dependent on their strength, with weaker models needing significant improvement in abstract reasoning and randomness utilization. The implementation is shared openly for reproducibility.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques the concept of a reasoning cliff in LRMs, arguing it stems from system-level constraints rather than intrinsic reasoning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to challenge the idea of a fundamental reasoning collapse in LRMs by exploring alternative explanations tied to experimental setup restrictions.

Method: The authors employed a tool-enhanced model approach to test reasoning capabilities beyond the text-only constraints and analyzed performance hierarchies.

Result: Tool-enabled models demonstrated the ability to overcome the reasoning cliff, showing advanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

Conclusion: The observed reasoning collapse in LRMs is not a cognitive limitation but a result of restrictive evaluation methods, reaffirming the importance of tool integration.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance of the TabPFN foundation model for sub-national crop yield forecasting in South Africa, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency over traditional machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and test the application of the TabPFN model, which has previously outperformed conventional ML methods, in a practical context of regional crop yield forecasting, aiming for efficient implementation with minimal feature engineering.

Method: The researchers used Earth Observation (FAPAR, soil moisture) and weather data (temperature, precipitation, radiation) aggregated monthly over 23 years across eight provinces. They applied TabPFN for prediction and benchmarked its performance against six machine learning models and three baselines using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.

Result: TabPFN performed comparably to ML models in terms of yield forecasting accuracy but outperformed regarding efficiency, due to its faster tuning and reduced need for feature engineering.

Conclusion: TabPFN presents a practical alternative for real-world yield forecasting tasks, offering a more efficient and easier-to-implement solution while maintaining prediction accuracy.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [5] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates six LLMs on their ability to play 'Baba is You,' a puzzle game requiring rule manipulation through reasoning, revealing performance gaps in reasoning about dynamic rule changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to assess whether LLMs, known for language tasks, can handle complex reasoning and dynamic rule manipulation as exemplified in the game 'Baba is You.'

Method: Six LLMs were tested using varied prompts (simple, rule-extended, action-extended) and finetuned for selected models (Mistral, OLMo) using textual and structural game data.

Result: Larger models like GPT-4o showed better reasoning and problem-solving abilities, while smaller, unadapted models struggled. Finetuning enhanced game-level analysis but did not significantly improve solution generation.

Conclusion: LLMs, even state-of-the-art ones, face challenges with reasoning about dynamic rule changes, emphasizing the role of such games as benchmarks for testing the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [6] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita and GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being, leveraging a novel dataset and metrics to benchmark AI performance in empathy and spirituality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mental health systems often fail to address deeper emotional needs by focusing solely on user's current emotions and situations, necessitating a more holistic approach.

Method: The authors created the GITes dataset (10,729 spiritually guided responses evaluated by domain experts), benchmarked against 12 state-of-the-art large language models, and proposed the Spiritual Insight metric using chain-of-thought prompting for evaluation.

Result: The Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct model achieved significant improvements across NLP (ROUGE, METEOR, BERT score) and spiritual metrics (Spiritual Insight, Sufficiency, Relevance) compared to its zero-shot counterpart.

Conclusion: Integrating spiritual guidance into AI shows promise for improving emotional support systems, though real world validation remains needed. Public code and dataset aim to catalyze further research.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [7] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents evolving through competition and belief revision based on Bayesian principles, showing truth as an evolutionary attractor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a mathematically sound AI framework where agents evolve toward truth through structured competition and belief updates.

Method: Using Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, the system assigns fitness to agents based on alignment to a ground-truth oracle, incorporates pairwise utility comparisons, causal inference with do-calculus, and ensures traceability via cryptography.

Result: Formal proofs demonstrate the system's convergence, robustness, and stability under adversarial epistemic conditions.

Conclusion: The framework confirms that verifiable knowledge can emerge from computed adversarial pressures, resulting in truth as an evolutionary attractor.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBGC, a novel graph coarsening method combining multi-granularity features via granular-ball computing to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing graph coarsening methods that focus mainly on spectrum-preservation while neglecting multi-granularity structures of graphs.

Method: GBGC employs an adaptive granular-ball graph refinement mechanism to split the original graph at optimal granularities, representing subregions as granular-balls that serve as supernodes in the coarsened graph.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art methods, GBGC significantly enhances processing speed by tens to hundreds of times, reduces time complexity, and achieves higher accuracy due to robustness and generalization properties.

Conclusion: GBGC provides an efficient, adaptive, and robust approach to graph coarsening, showing potential to become a standard preprocessing method for graph data.

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a recommendation framework leveraging Large Language Models to optimize accuracy, diversity, and novelty in recommendations, addressing challenges like filter bubbles and policy iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems face challenges such as filter bubbles, limited external knowledge utilization, and misalignment with business policies.

Method: RecLLM-R1 uses Large Language Models with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for basic capabilities and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for multi-step reasoning and holistic optimization.

Result: The framework outperformed baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing filter bubbles and aligning with complex business objectives.

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1 showcases the potential for integrated optimization of recommendation systems, promising improved user experiences and alignment with business strategies.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

### [10] [Emotion Detection on User Front-Facing App Interfaces for Enhanced Schedule Optimization: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19280)
*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates integrating emotion recognition into calendar apps via biometrics (using ECG data and neural networks) and behavioral methods (analyzing computer activity). Behavioral methods, especially mouse-related interactions, were found more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance personalized and adaptive user experiences in calendar applications by embedding emotion recognition features, thereby improving productivity and engagement.

Method: Two approaches were tested for emotion detection: (1) a biometric method using ECG data analyzed with LSTM and GRU neural networks to predict emotional dimensions (Valence, Arousal, Dominance), and (2) a behavioral method analyzing user interactions (mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes) using machine learning models.

Result: The study found the behavioral method to be more consistent and accurate, achieving approximately 90% accuracy in mouse-related classifications. GRU networks performed better than LSTMs in the biometric method, with Valence prediction reaching 84.38% accuracy.

Conclusion: Emotion detection can enhance HCI experiences. While both biometric and behavioral approaches are effective, behavioral methods, particularly mouse-related analyses, show superior accuracy and consistency for integration into applications like calendar tools.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

### [11] [Skywork-SWE: Unveiling Data Scaling Laws for Software Engineering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19290)
*Liang Zeng,Yongcong Li,Yuzhen Xiao,Changshi Li,Chris Yuhao Liu,Rui Yan,Tianwen Wei,Jujie He,Xuchen Song,Yang Liu,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated data-curation pipeline for creating large-scale software engineering (SWE) datasets, resulting in the Skywork-SWE model that achieves significant performance improvements in SWE tasks, with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in current SWE datasets, which are small and manually curated, and to enable better performance of large language models (LLMs) in SWE tasks requiring iterative problem-solving and long-context dependencies.

Method: The authors developed an automated pipeline to curate a large SWE dataset, including 10,169 Python tasks with runtime environments and 8,000 validated training trajectories. They fine-tuned the Skywork-SWE model on this dataset to improve LLM performance in SWE tasks.

Result: The fine-tuned Skywork-SWE model achieved state-of-the-art results with 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, and further improvements to 47.0% accuracy with test-time scaling techniques.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that expanding and automating SWE datasets can significantly enhance LLM performance in SWE tasks. The Skywork-SWE model and its resources are released to advance further research in the field.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

### [12] [FEAT: A Preference Feedback Dataset through a Cost-Effective Auto-Generation and Labeling Framework for English AI Tutoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19325)
*Hyein Seo,Taewook Hwang,Yohan Lee,sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback, involving three datasets (DM, DG, DA), showing that augmenting AI-generated data with a small amount of human-enhanced data improves performance while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teacher feedback is vital for tutoring, but generating high-quality, large-scale feedback data manually is time-consuming and expensive. The authors aim to address this challenge.

Method: The study introduces FEAT, a framework combining human and AI collaboration to produce three types of datasets: DM (costly but high-quality human-AI feedback), DG (cost-effective AI-only feedback), and DA (a blend of DG with 5-10% of DM).

Result: Using DA (DG augmented with a small portion of DM) delivers better results than solely relying on DM, achieving higher performance at reduced costs.

Conclusion: Blending AI-generated and human-enhanced data (DA) effectively reduces costs while maintaining or surpassing performance in generating teacher feedback for English education tutoring.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

*Debosmita Bhaumik,Julian Togelius,Georgios N. Yannakakis,Ahmed Khalifa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses fixing non-functional game levels using search-based methods, focusing on evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of repairing game levels generated by a PCGML method that are stylistically appropriate but often contain functional flaws.

Method: The authors employed search-based methods, including evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, to repair broken game levels under constraints such as minimal changes.

Result: The combination of PCGML for generating game levels and search-based methods for repairing them yielded promising results as a hybrid approach.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that integrating PCGML with search-based repair methods can effectively address the challenge of creating functional and stylistically appropriate game levels.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

### [14] [Conversational Intent-Driven GraphRAG: Enhancing Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems through Adaptive Dual-Retrieval of Flow Patterns and Context Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19385)
*Ziqi Zhu,Tao Hu,Honglong Zhang,Dan Yang,HanGeng Chen,Mengran Zhang,Xilun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG integrates conversational intent and semantic retrieval for improved response quality in customer service dialogues, surpassing existing methods in coherence and goal-oriented progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in dialogue systems, specifically maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer conversations.

Method: Developed CID-GraphRAG, which builds dynamic intent transition graphs from historical dialogues and employs a dual-retrieval mechanism combining intent-based graph traversal and semantic search.

Result: Extensive experiments show CID-GraphRAG outperforms traditional models with significant gains, such as 58% improved response quality based on LLM-as-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic intent structures with semantic retrieval enhances performance, making CID-GraphRAG effective for complex customer service dialogues.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

### [15] [Is an object-centric representation beneficial for robotic manipulation ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19408)
*Alexandre Chapin,Emmanuel Dellandrea,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates object-centric representation (OCR) methods in robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating OCR's advantages in handling complex scenes over holistic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore OCR's potential in enhancing data-efficiency and generalization, especially in dynamic and complex robotic manipulation environments.

Method: Simulated diverse robotic manipulation environments with various object attributes and evaluated a classical OCR method against holistic representations in different generalization scenarios.

Result: OCR exhibited superior performance in scenarios that were difficult for holistic representation methods due to complex scene structures.

Conclusion: Object-centric approaches show promise for improving robot task learning by effectively managing complex environments, although existing methods are still limited.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

### [17] [Commander-GPT: Dividing and Routing for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19420)
*Yazhou Zhang,Chunwang Zou,Bo Wang,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Commander-GPT, a modular framework for improving sarcasm understanding by combining the capabilities of multiple specialized large language models (LLMs), achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often struggle with the nuanced task of sarcasm understanding, despite their success in other NLP tasks. The paper aims to address this limitation by leveraging modular teamwork and decision routing inspired by military theory.

Method: Commander-GPT employs a team of specialized LLM agents assigned to focused subtasks such as context modeling and sentiment analysis. Their outputs are integrated by centralized commanders, which make final sarcasm judgments using one of three methods: lightweight encoder-based models, moderately capable autoregressive models, or zero-shot large LLMs.

Result: Commander-GPT was tested on sarcasm benchmarks MMSD and MMSD 2.0, achieving 4.4% and 11.7% improvements in F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines using five prompting strategies.

Conclusion: The modular decision-routing approach of Commander-GPT effectively enhances sarcasm understanding, demonstrating its viability as an innovative solution in challenging NLP tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### [19] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a novel graph-based architecture for efficient tool invocation, ensuring high success rates across diverse, complex tasks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for managing complex toolchains with LLMs are rigid and lack error recovery, making them inefficient for large-scale tasks.

Method: NaviAgent employs a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture, combining a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator to optimize tool invocation and decision-making.

Result: NaviAgent outperformed existing baselines with an average TSR improvement of 13.5–19.0% across multiple models and tasks, ensuring efficiency close to the best-performing baselines.

Conclusion: The integration of the Graph-Encoded Navigator significantly boosts efficiency and success rates, especially in complex tasks, making NaviAgent a milestone in toolchain orchestration.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

### [20] [NTRL: Encounter Generation via Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Dungeons and Dragons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19530)
*Carlo Romeo,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning method to automatically balance combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), enhancing game strategies and difficulty without compromising fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the challenging task of balancing D&D combat encounters while maintaining a fluid narrative and providing engaging gameplay.

Method: Introduces "Encounter Generation via Reinforcement Learning" (NTRL), which models the problem as a contextual bandit and creates dynamic combat scenarios based on real-time player attributes.

Result: NTRL improves combat longevity by 200%, reduces party hit points by 16.67%, slightly increases player deaths without high total party kills, and leads to more tactical gameplay.

Conclusion: NTRL enhances strategic depth and difficulty in D&D combat encounters, outperforming traditional Dungeon Master heuristics while ensuring fairness and engagement.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

*Sanne Wielinga,Jesse Heyninck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Answer Set Programming (ASP) symbolic reasoning with machine learning (ML) classifiers to improve accuracy and interpretability in medical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-performing ML models, like neural networks and ensemble methods, are opaque and lack interpretability, limiting their acceptance, especially in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: The authors integrate ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML classifiers to enhance prediction reliability and provide human-readable explanations.

Result: Experiments conducted on five medical datasets demonstrate statistically significant improvements in accuracy and F1 score compared to standalone ML methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances interpretability and accuracy, showcasing the synergy between symbolic reasoning and machine learning in high-stakes applications like healthcare.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TAPAS leverages LLMs integrated with symbolic planning and specialized agents to dynamically adapt and execute tasks without manual environment modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional manual environment models and to enhance task execution flexibility and adaptability by combining LLMs with symbolic planning.

Method: The framework employs LLM-based agents that collaboratively modify domain models, initial conditions, and goals using structured tool-calls, coupled with ReAct execution and natural language plan translation to bridge planning with real-world tasks.

Result: TAPAS showcases strong performance in benchmark planning domains and simulated environments like VirtualHome.

Conclusion: TAPAS demonstrates that blending LLMs with symbolic planning and multi-agent collaboration is effective in solving complex, adaptive tasks efficiently, removing reliance on manual domain modeling.

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Bokui Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChordPrompt, a framework for improving continual learning in vision-language models. It addresses issues in multi-domain, task-incremental learning using cross-modal prompts and domain-adaptive text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of continual learning in vision-language models, including poor domain retention and neglect of cross-modal information exchange.

Method: The ChordPrompt framework is proposed, involving cross-modal prompts and domain-adaptive text prompts to enhance the interaction between visual and textual information for incremental learning.

Result: ChordPrompt outperforms existing approaches in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance, showcasing its efficacy in multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChordPrompt makes vision-language models more adaptable and efficient for continual learning across multiple domains by leveraging cross-modal interactions and domain-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs), a paradigm that combines AI-driven reasoning and embodied robots to automate and enhance scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent limitations in AI and automated labs, which hinder the advancement of autonomous, adaptive scientific experimentation.

Method: Proposing a multi-layered framework integrating cognitive AI (e.g., foundation models) and embodied intelligence (e.g., generalist robots), enabling closed-loop experimentation.

Result: The ISL framework aligns virtual reasoning with physical experimentation, facilitating iterative and autonomous research cycles.

Conclusion: The proposed ISLs could overcome current scientific research constraints, unlocking transformative AI-driven discovery opportunities.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [25] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the applicability of do-calculus, a method for identifying causal effects, to more complex graph structures (C-DMGs over DMGs) that allow for cycles, proving its soundness and completeness in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal tools like do-calculus succeed for ADMGs but fail when extended cyclic causal dynamics appear in real-world systems. This motivates the study to establish a broader theoretical foundation for causal effect identification.

Method: The authors leverage input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) and their induced directed mixed graphs (DMGs) to generalize previous results on do-calculus. They establish soundness and completeness for causal identification in C-DMGs over DMGs.

Result: The paper shows that do-calculus is both unconditionally sound and complete for identifying causal effects in the context of C-DMGs over DMGs. Graphical criteria for non-identifiability were also extended.

Conclusion: Do-calculus can reliably identify causal effects in complex graph structures, accounting for cyclic causal dependencies, thus enhancing causal modeling's practicality in real-world systems.

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

### [26] [From memories to maps: Mechanisms of in context reinforcement learning in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19686)
*Ching Fang,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers can be used for in-context reinforcement learning, revealing parallels with episodic memory systems in humans and animals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand rapid learning and adaptation in humans and animals, and investigate how transformers can replicate such episodic memory-driven behaviors.

Method: A transformer model was trained on reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behaviors, then analyzed to uncover its learning mechanisms.

Result: The transformer developed novel learning strategies, relying on cached computations in memory tokens rather than standard model-free or model-based planning.

Conclusion: Memory acts as a computational tool, storing experiences and computations, with findings relevant to cognition and suggesting a hypothesis for rapid adaptation in artificial and natural contexts.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework for predictive maintenance (PdM) that aligns model training with maintenance objectives, mitigating prediction errors' impacts on decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address model misspecification and its negative impact on maintenance decisions in predictive maintenance, especially in data-rich but uncertain settings.

Method: Developed an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that simultaneously trains predictive models and optimizes maintenance decisions. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm supports small datasets.

Result: The IEO framework reduces maintenance regret by up to 22% compared to traditional methods in a turbofan maintenance case study, improving decision consistency.

Conclusion: The IEO framework improves decision quality, robustness under model misspecification, and aligns prognostic training with maintenance goals, supporting better maintenance planning in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a medical document analysis platform fine-tuned for differential diagnosis using LLaMA-v3, achieving state-of-the-art results while preserving patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need for AI solutions in clinical document analysis that are accurate, explainable, and privacy-preserving, especially to assist in differential diagnosis.

Method: The study fine-tuned a LLaMA-v3 model with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on the DDXPlus benchmark dataset and developed a web-based interface for unstructured medical document analysis.

Result: The platform showed superior diagnostic accuracy in pathology prediction and differential diagnosis, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical, trustworthy, and explainable AI solution to address challenges in clinical document analysis, advancing its real-world applicability.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

### [29] [From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19724)
*Gyeongwon James Kim,Alex Wilf,Louis-Philippe Morency,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoExperiment, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to implement and run scientific experiments from research papers, bridging the gap between reproduction and replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess and advance the capability of AI agents to autonomously conduct scientific experiments using varied inputs, addressing the lack of benchmarks for interpolating between code reproduction and from-scratch replication.

Method: The approach involves an experimental benchmark where AI agents receive a research paper, a partially incomplete codebase, and a command to run the experiment. The agents must generate the missing code, execute it in a sandbox, and reproduce the results.

Result: The results show a decline in agent performance as the number of missing functions increases. Agents with interactive debugging capabilities outperform static ones, and multi-trial attempts improve success rates, highlighting areas for development.

Conclusion: AutoExperiment serves as a critical benchmark for evaluating AI-driven scientific experimentation, exposing challenges in long-horizon code generation and autonomous execution. It establishes a foundation for future advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

### [30] [Automatic Prompt Optimization for Knowledge Graph Construction: Insights from an Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19773)
*Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Niharika S. D'Souza,Faisal Chowdhury,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates automatic prompt optimization for extracting triples (subject-relation-object) to build knowledge graphs (KGs) using LLMs. Methods and benchmarks are compared, showing that optimized prompts are effective and perform well in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies challenges in using large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) construction due to the need for labor-intensive and brittle handcrafted prompts. It aims to explore whether automatic prompt optimization can simplify and improve this process.

Method: The study evaluates three automatic prompt optimization techniques (DSPy, APE, and TextGrad) on two datasets (SynthIE and REBEL) while testing various experimental scenarios such as schema complexity, input text length, and metrics for optimization.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization methods generate prompts that perform on par with or better than handcrafted prompts in triple extraction tasks, especially in cases with higher schema complexity and longer texts.

Conclusion: Automatic prompt optimization is a viable, efficient, and effective approach for triple extraction in KG construction, mitigating reliance on labor-intensive handcrafted prompts.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

### [31] [SAGE: Strategy-Adaptive Generation Engine for Query Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19783)
*Teng Wang,Hailei Gong,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using guided strategies to improve query rewriting for dense retrieval and introduces a model, SAGE, that leverages these strategies within a reinforcement learning framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for query rewriting in dense retrieval either require large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient exploration during learning.

Method: The authors establish the value of expert-crafted strategies like semantic expansion and entity disambiguation and introduce the SAGE model with two reward shaping mechanisms: Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS).

Result: The approach achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results on benchmarks and reduces inference cost while maintaining high retrieval effectiveness.

Conclusion: Strategy-guided reinforcement learning with refined reward shaping mechanisms is a scalable, efficient, and interpretable approach for advancing information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

### [32] [Learning Task Belief Similarity with Latent Dynamics for Meta-Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19785)
*Menglong Zhang,Fuyuan Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief is a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework designed for rapid task adaptation in sparse reward environments by using task belief similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve rapid task adaptation and exploration efficiency in meta-reinforcement learning, especially under sparse reward conditions.

Method: The paper introduces SimBelief, which utilizes latent task belief metrics to learn and integrate common structures of task distributions, enabling efficient task identification and adaptation in Bayes-Adaptive MDPs.

Result: SimBelief exhibits superior performance compared to previous Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches on sparse reward tasks in environments like MuJoCo and panda-gym.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that integrating behavioral similarity via latent task belief metrics significantly enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities in sparse reward meta-RL scenarios.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

*Baochang Ren,Shuofei Qiao,Wenhao Yu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KnowRL, a reinforcement learning approach that reduces hallucination in slow-thinking language models by incorporating factuality rewards into the RL process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of severe hallucination in slow-thinking language models, which arises from their inability to recognize knowledge boundaries and the lack of factual supervision during reasoning steps in traditional reinforcement learning.

Method: The proposed method, KnowRL, integrates a factuality reward based on knowledge verification into the reinforcement learning training process. This approach promotes fact-based slow thinking by helping the model recognize knowledge boundaries and internalize reasoning strategies grounded in facts.

Result: Experiments conducted on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets show that KnowRL significantly reduces hallucination in slow-thinking models while preserving their strong reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: KnowRL is a promising approach for improving the reliability of slow-thinking language models by mitigating hallucination and maintaining reasoning effectiveness through fact-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

### [34] [Evaluating Compliance with Visualization Guidelines in Diagrams for Scientific Publications Using Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19825)
*Johannes Rückert,Louise Bloch,Christoph M. Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores the use of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze diagrams for adherence to data visualization principles, revealing that these models are effective for some visualization aspects but struggle with others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of misinformation caused by inaccurate or incomplete diagram visualizations in research publications, aiming to leverage VLMs to monitor adherence to data visualization principles and guidelines.

Method: The authors evaluate five open-source VLMs and five prompting strategies on a set of metrics derived from data visualization guidelines to assess their effectiveness in identifying potential issues in diagrams.

Result: The best-performing VLM achieved high accuracy in analyzing diagram types, 3D effects, axes labels, lines, colors, and legends but showed poor performance in evaluating image quality and tick marks/labels. The Qwen2.5VL model and summarizing prompting strategy were found most effective.

Conclusion: Large VLMs demonstrate potential for automating the detection of certain visualization flaws such as missing labels or unnecessary 3D effects. Future research can refine and expand this approach to cover broader aspects of data visualization.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

*Guo Li,Zixiang Xu,Wei Zhang,Yikuan Hu,Xinyu Yang,Nikolay Aristov,Mingjie Tang,Elenna R Dugundji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Temporal-IRL model for predicting port congestion by analyzing vessel behavior and berth scheduling at the Port of New York/New Jersey, with highly accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to improve global supply chain reliability by accurately predicting port congestion. Efficient forecasting helps in better shipment planning, reducing delays, lowering costs, and optimizing inventory and distribution strategies.

Method: The paper introduces a Temporal-IRL model that reconstructs berth schedules from vessel behavior. It employs historical AIS data to learn the underlying berth scheduling patterns using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) for forecasting vessel sequencing and port congestion.

Result: The researchers applied the Temporal-IRL model on Maher Terminal data (January 2015 - September 2023), achieving high accuracy in predicting vessel sequencing and port stay times, thereby effectively forecasting port congestion.

Conclusion: The study concludes that analyzing vessel behavior using Temporal-IRL can effectively predict port congestion, significantly contributing to supply chain resilience and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

*Ai Han,Junxing Hu,Pu Wei,Zhiqian Zhang,Yuhang Guo,Jiawei Lu,Zicheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method that optimizes cooperative efficiency and training stability using a combination of advanced sampling and memory evolution techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of cooperative inefficiency and training instability in multi-agent reinforcement learning, especially for heterogeneous agents.

Method: The paper introduces JoyAgents-R1 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Monte Carlo sampling, marginal benefit-driven selection, and adaptive memory evolution strategies to enhance learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments showcase that JoyAgents-R1 achieves competitive performance compared to larger language models, while leveraging smaller and open-source models.

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 provides an effective framework for joint evolution dynamics in MARL, improving efficiency, stability, and convergence with cost-effective approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

*Hossein Taji,José Miranda,Miguel Peón-Quirós,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEDEA, a design-time manager for energy-efficient DNN inference on heterogeneous ultra-low power platforms, achieving up to 38% energy reductions by integrating techniques like kernel-level DVFS and memory-aware adaptive tiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained ultra-low power platforms motivates the development of a solution that balances energy efficiency with performance and application deadlines.

Method: MEDEA combines kernel-level DVFS, kernel granularity scheduling, memory-aware adaptive tiling, and timing constraint-based optimization strategies to manage platform resources efficiently.

Result: The MEDEA framework demonstrated a 38% reduction in energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods while adhering to timing and memory requirements in experiments using HEEPtimize.

Conclusion: MEDEA's integrated approach is highly effective for energy-efficient DNN inference on heterogeneous ULP platforms, with significant contributions from kernel-level DVFS and other optimization techniques.

Abstract: The growing demand for on-device AI necessitates energy-efficient execution
of DNN based applications on resource-constrained ultra-low power (ULP)
platforms. Heterogeneous architectures, combining specialized processing
elements (PEs), have emerged as a key solution for achieving the required
performance and energy efficiency. However, optimizing energy while executing
applications on these platforms requires efficiently managing platform
resources like PEs, power features, and memory footprint, all while adhering to
critical application deadlines. This paper presents MEDEA, a novel design-time
multi-objective manager for energy-efficient DNN inference on Heterogeneous ULP
(HULP) platforms. MEDEA uniquely integrates: kernel-level dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling (DVFS) for dynamic energy adaptation; kernel-level
granularity scheduling, suitable for specialized accelerators; memory-aware
adaptive tiling to navigate severe memory constraints; and all within a timing
constraint-based optimization strategy, which minimizes energy based on
application deadline. To showcase practical viability, we evaluate MEDEA on
HEEPtimize, a heterogeneous ULP platform (22 nm, FPGA-prototyped) featuring a
RISC-V processor besides Near-Memory Computing (NMC) and Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerators. Experimental results, using a
biomedical seizure detection case study, demonstrate that MEDEA achieves
overall energy reductions of up to 38% compared to representative
state-of-the-art methods, while consistently meeting all timing and memory
requirements. This effectiveness is attributed to its integrated features, with
our analysis showing that kernel-level DVFS alone can be responsible for over
31% of the energy savings in specific scenarios.

### [38] [Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037)
*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an efficient inference method for Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) that dramatically reduces denoiser calls while improving text generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked diffusion language models rely on heuristics like denoiser confidence or entropy scores for unmasking tokens, which fail to handle dependencies when unmasking multiple positions in parallel. This limits their performance compared to auto-regressive models.

Method: The authors propose DUS, a planner-free approach based on a first-order Markov assumption. It organizes sequence positions using dilation groups of non-adjacent tokens, unmasking them independently and in parallel, while minimizing joint entropy at each step. Unlike existing semi-autoregressive methods, DUS uses O(log B) denoiser calls per generation block.

Result: Experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks show that DUS improves performance over confidence-based planners without altering the denoiser, achieving significant computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DUS establishes an efficient, lightweight, and high-quality text generation method for MDLMs without additional training, enabling better exploitation of their potential and outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives in both speed and quality.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dataset, MemeMind, and a framework, MemeGuard, to address challenges in harmful meme detection, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current datasets and methods for detecting harmful memes, focusing on semantic and multimodal complexities.

Method: Developed MemeMind, a bilingual and annotated dataset, and created MemeGuard, a framework integrating multimodal information and reasoning processes.

Result: MemeGuard outperformed existing methods in harmful meme detection tasks based on experiments using the MemeMind dataset.

Conclusion: MemeMind and MemeGuard set a new benchmark in this field, particularly through enhanced understanding and detection of harmful memes.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues in large language models (LLMs) mistaking memorization for reasoning ability, especially in STEM domains, leading to inconsistencies in self-knowledge assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intertwined challenges of memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs that degrade trustworthiness.

Method: A novel framework to evaluate whether LLMs genuinely learn reasoning or rely on memorized solutions, focusing on STEM domains with task perturbations.

Result: LLMs show over 45% inconsistency in self-knowledge assessment, particularly in science and medicine, pointing to fundamental flaws in current architectures and training.

Conclusion: Better methods are needed to ensure LLMs maintain consistent self-knowledge for trustworthy and explainable AI applications.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of language models (LMs) to non-canonical tokenizations and finds that instruction-tuned LMs perform robustly under such conditions, with specific tokenizations sometimes improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenizers deterministically convert text into canonical token sequences, but real-world applications may involve non-canonical tokenizations. Investigating how LMs handle this variability can provide insights and potential performance improvements.

Method: The authors tested LMs such as instruction-tuned models across 20 benchmarks using various non-canonical tokenizations, including random sampling and character-level tokenizations, and analyzed robustness. They further examined character-level and digit-grouping tokenizations for specific tasks and traced robustness origins to the instruction-tuning phase.

Result: The study found that instruction-tuned models retained 93.4% performance with random tokenizations and 90.8% with character-level tokenizations. Furthermore, character-level tokenizations improved string manipulation and code tasks by 14%, while right-aligned digit grouping boosted arithmetic by 33%.

Conclusion: Language models, especially instruction-tuned ones, exhibit considerable robustness to unseen tokenizations, and performance can even improve in certain tasks through tokenization interventions, especially during inference.

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

### [42] [Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19028)
*Weijie Xu,Yiwen Wang,Chi Xue,Xiangkun Hu,Xi Fang,Guimin Dong,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo is a novel statistical framework for analyzing biases in long-form responses of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on claim-level semantic consistency instead of surface-level comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address biases in LLM-generated responses that are overlooked by existing evaluation methods, especially in long-form outputs with inherent variability.

Method: FiSCo assesses group-level fairness by decomposing model outputs into claims, using entailment checks for meaning consistency, and applying statistical hypothesis testing to detect biases.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and human-annotated datasets show that FiSCo effectively identifies nuanced biases related to gender, race, and age, outperforming other metrics by mitigating LLM variability's impact.

Conclusion: FiSCo offers a reliable approach for detecting subtle biases in LLMs, advancing fairness evaluation through claim-level semantic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

*Mike Zhang,Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study focuses on enhancing job title matching and skill prediction tasks using multilingual linguistic models and achieved competitive results in TalentCLEF 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving computational job market tasks like automatic candidate matching, career path prediction, and job market analysis.

Method: Comparison of fine-tuned classification, fine-tuned contrastive, and prompting methods using multilingual templates. Leveraging extra language-specific data from ESCO.

Result: Prompting approach outperforms in job title matching (MAP: 0.492), and fine-tuned classification achieves MAP: 0.290 for skill prediction. Ranked 5th/20 in job title matching and 3rd/14 in skill prediction.

Conclusion: Multilingual large language models demonstrate superiority in computational job market tasks, underscoring their relevance for practical applications.

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

*Jackson Trager,Francielle Vargas,Diego Alves,Matteo Guida,Mikel K. Ngueajio,Ameeta Agrawal,Flor Plaza-del-Arco,Yalda Daryanai,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual dataset, MFTCXplain, to evaluate moral reasoning in LLMs, identifying limitations in reasoning capabilities despite good hate speech detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in current benchmarks for evaluating LLM moral reasoning, including the lack of interpretability and focus on diverse cultural settings.

Method: Developed MFTCXplain, a benchmark dataset of 3,000 multilingual tweets annotated with hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales, based on Moral Foundation Theory.

Result: LLMs achieve high performance in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), but perform poorly in predicting moral sentiments (F1 < 0.35). Rationale alignment is especially weak in underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant limitations in moral reasoning and rationale alignment, highlighting the need for further advancements to align LLMs with human moral understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

*Nathaniel Getachew,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: $	exttt{StorySim}$ is a framework for generating synthetic stories to assess large language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating ToM and WM in LLMs are affected by data contamination and lack of precise control, prompting the need for a better method.

Method: The paper introduces $	exttt{StorySim}$, a framework relying on a controllable $	exttt{Storyboard}$ to generate novel story prompts, enabling precise evaluation of ToM and WM tasks.

Result: Experiments show LLMs perform better on WM than ToM, especially when reasoning about humans. Heuristic behaviors such as recency bias were also discovered.

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$ provides a novel, effective, and precise tool to evaluate and analyze LLMs, highlighting their limitations and biases.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

### [46] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel evaluation criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), to measure how well large language models (LLMs) provide human-like, faithful explanations about toxicity. Results indicate LLMs struggle with nuanced reasoning on toxicity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond toxicity detection in NLP and focus on evaluating the reasoning and trustworthiness of LLMs when explaining toxicity, particularly addressing the challenges of current explainability methods.

Method: The authors propose the Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF) criterion, supported by six uncertainty-based metrics, to measure how closely LLM toxicity explanations align with ideal human rational explanations. Experiments were conducted on various LLMs and toxicity datasets.

Result: The study found that LLMs can offer plausible explanations for basic prompts but struggle with consistency and reasoning when dealing with complex interrelations of toxicity logic. This reveals significant gaps in their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs fall short in generating rational and consistent explanations for nuanced toxicity tasks, limiting their trustworthiness for downstream applications. The work provides insights into their weaknesses and offers an open-source resource for further research.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

*Yun Tang,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces J-TAED, a hybrid ASR model that integrates speech and text data for training, leading to lower WER on in- and out-of-domain datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR accuracy by combining speech and text data, leveraging the large amount of text corpus effectively, and addressing domain mismatch issues.

Method: J-TAED trains a hybrid TAED model using both speech and text input modalities simultaneously, with text-only data enabling domain adaptation to tackle data scarcity in certain domains.

Result: J-TAED reduced WER by 5.8~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset and achieved 15.3% and 17.8% WER reductions on finance and named entity-focused datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates J-TAED's effectiveness in unifying linguistic and acoustic information within a single model, with significant improvements in ASR performance across different domains.

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

*Christopher Toukmaji,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper comprehensively explores various adaptation methods for low-resource language tasks in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Few-shot prompting and translate-test outperform gradient-based methods due to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of low-resource languages in in-context learning due to limited prior research and effective methodologies.

Method: The study includes five low-resource languages, three LLM bases, seven downstream tasks, and diverse adaptation techniques. It introduces a novel metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and conducts over 4,100 GPU training hours.

Result: Few-shot prompting and translate-test methods showed significantly better performance compared to gradient-based techniques, which suffered from catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Gradient-free strategies like few-shot prompting are more effective for adapting LLMs cross-lingually, providing insights into overcoming challenges in low-resource language tasks.

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

### [49] [Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209)
*Yichen Tang,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Min Zhang,Shaoping Ma,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new communication protocol for multi-agent systems using large language models (LLMs) to improve performance in complex reasoning tasks. Instead of relying solely on natural language, it introduces State Delta Encoding (SDE) to include token-wise state transition trajectories, leading to better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for communication, which can result in information loss, especially in transferring reasoning or abstract thought processes. This loss limits the potential of LLM-based systems.

Method: The authors introduce State Delta Encoding (SDE), a protocol capturing token-wise state transition trajectories in addition to natural language tokens to enhance communication in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Result: Multi-agent systems equipped with SDE achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in tasks requiring complex reasoning, highlighting its effectiveness over conventional communication methods.

Conclusion: Integrating token-wise state transition trajectories provides a significant improvement in multi-agent communication systems, particularly for tasks involving intricate reasoning, showing the promise of augmented communication frameworks for LLM applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: Using a hybrid NLP method combining sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models and RNNs with attention mechanisms, this study predicts personality traits from long narrative interviews effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personality assessment by leveraging language-based features from life narratives, moving beyond traditional questionnaire methods.

Method: A two-step hybrid approach is proposed: 1) extracting contextual embeddings via sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained language models, and 2) employing RNNs with attention mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies and improving interpretability.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved prediction accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability when compared to state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and Longformer.

Conclusion: Combining pretrained transformers with sequence modeling provides a promising direction for advancing long-context personality assessment through life narratives.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

TL;DR: The paper examines how the diversity of data generated by large language models (LLMs) impacts the performance of downstream models, revealing that moderate diversity is beneficial while excessive diversity leads to negative effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of model collapse caused by iterative training on LLM-generated data and understand the role of data diversity in improving data quality for downstream tasks.

Method: The authors investigate varying levels of diversity in LLM-generated data and its effects on downstream model performance, including experiments with synthetic data combining labeled and generated data.

Result: Moderately diverse LLM-generated data improved downstream model performance in cases of inadequate labeled data, while highly diverse data detracted from performance.

Conclusion: Moderate diversity in LLM-generated data provides advantages for downstream model training, offering insights for leveraging LLMs as effective data generators in the future.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for mental health support and the rising interest in AI-driven counseling systems motivated the research, addressing issues such as limited understanding of psychological states, reliance on quality data, and privacy concerns.

Method: The EmoStage framework uses perspective-taking to understand psychological states and integrates phase recognition to ensure responses align with counseling stages, leveraging open-source LLMs without extra training data.

Result: EmoStage enhanced the quality of empathetic responses generated by base models and showcased competitive performance compared to data-driven approaches in both Japanese and Chinese counseling settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles limitations in AI counseling systems, demonstrating its capacity to generate emotionally resonant and contextually appropriate responses.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for enhanced pronunciation feedback in second language (L2) learning and explore the benefits of joint modeling of automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD).

Method: The authors introduce a unified framework that uses Mamba (a selective state space model) combined with phonological features and think token strategies to improve interpretability and temporal reasoning in APA and MDD.

Result: Experiments on the speechocean762 benchmark show that the proposed model consistently outperforms previous methods, particularly excelling in the MDD task.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of joint modeling in CAPT systems by integrating phonological attribution, SSM-based methods, and prompting, offering significant improvements in pronunciation feedback tasks.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of Out-of-Character behavior in large language models by proposing an atomic-level evaluation framework with specialized metrics to ensure finer granularity in assessing persona fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance coherent and engaging human-AI interactions by addressing inconsistencies where LLMs deviate from their assigned personas, which affects their reliability.

Method: The paper introduces an atomic-level evaluation framework with three specific metrics to measure persona alignment and consistency within and across text generations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to detect subtle persona inconsistencies that prior methods failed to capture. It further sheds light on the influence of task structure and persona desirability on model adaptability.

Conclusion: The study offers a refined approach for assessing persona fidelity in LLMs, paving the way for improved reliability and engagement in AI interactions across varied tasks and personas.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method to improve interpretability and control of LLMs by achieving better feature monosemanticity and disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for understanding and influencing LLM internal dynamics face challenges in reliably isolating and manipulating feature representations. The paper aims to address these fundamental limitations.

Method: The authors propose a novel metric, Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), and Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE) that condition latent representations on labeled concepts during training to improve feature isolation and disentanglement.

Result: G-SAE demonstrates improved monosemanticity, interpretability, and control in LLMs for tasks such as toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable guidelines for improving mechanistic interpretability and control of LLMs, showcasing how G-SAE enables effective and fine-grained steering of model behaviors.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

### [56] [Automated Detection of Pre-training Text in Black-box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19399)
*Ruihan Hu,Yu-Ming Shang,Jiankun Peng,Wei Luo,Yazhe Wang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeilProbe is a framework designed to detect whether a text was included in the pre-training data of LLMs, using a black-box approach without relying on model internals or manual efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure data privacy and copyright protection by detecting if texts are part of an LLM's pre-training data in a black-box setting.

Method: VeilProbe uses a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to analyze latent features and applies key token perturbations. A prototype-based classifier is then used to reduce overfitting.

Result: VeilProbe effectively identifies membership in pre-training datasets, outperforming existing methods in comprehensive tests on three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an automated, practical solution to detect LLM pre-training texts under black-box conditions, advancing data protection and privacy measures.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

### [57] [Learning to Disentangle Latent Reasoning Rules with Language VAEs: A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19418)
*Yingji Zhang,Marco Valentino,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding explicit reasoning rules into language models using Language Variational Autoencoders to enhance reasoning tasks, introducing disentanglement of rules, prior knowledge integration, and identifying performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve generalization, interpretability, and controllability of language models by embedding explicit reasoning rules, addressing the issue of reliance on memorization rather than rule-based inference.

Method: The study uses Transformer-based language Variational Autoencoders and proposes an end-to-end pipeline with theoretical and practical frameworks for embedding reasoning rules through three rule-based reasoning tasks.

Result: Key findings include disentangling reasoning rules in the latent space, effective prior knowledge injection for better memory retrieval, and identifying that increasing samples doesn't improve mathematical reasoning beyond a threshold but ffn layers perform better at preserving reasoning rule separation.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning rules can be disentangled and effectively integrated into language models through the proposed method, but certain architectural choices and limitations must be considered when extending this to complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

*Jingwei Ni,Yu Fan,Vilém Zouhar,Donya Rooein,Alexander Hoyle,Mrinmaya Sachan,Markus Leippold,Dirk Hovy,Elliott Ash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for their ability to capture human annotation disagreements and finds they struggle in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation disagreements provide valuable insights such as task subjectivity and ambiguity, but their modeling by LLMs remains underexplored.

Method: The authors extensively evaluate LLMs' disagreement prediction abilities without access to repeated human labels and examine the impact of RLVR-style reasoning.

Result: LLMs demonstrated limited ability to model annotation disagreements, and RLVR-style reasoning degraded their disagreement prediction performance.

Conclusion: Current evaluations focusing on majority-voted labels may overlook crucial weaknesses in modeling annotation disagreements. Improvement is needed in this area for LLM annotators.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

*Wenhan Han,Yifan Zhang,Zhixun Chen,Binbin Liu,Haobin Lin,Bingni Zhang,Taifeng Wang,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang,Yin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuBench as a benchmark to evaluate multilingual large language models (LLMs) across 61 languages, revealing gaps in language coverage and performance disparities among languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are limited in cross-lingual alignment, leading to fragmented assessments of multilingual LLMs, motivating the need for a comprehensive multilingual evaluation framework like MuBench.

Method: The authors create MuBench to benchmark LLMs across numerous languages and capabilities, and propose new metrics such as Multilingual Consistency (MLC) alongside conducting pretraining experiments on models with varying language ratios and parallel data proportions.

Result: Evaluation revealed performance gaps between claimed coverage and actual language capabilities in multilingual LLMs, especially between English and low-resource languages.

Conclusion: MuBench helps identify performance bottlenecks and provides valuable insights for improving multilingual LLMs' cross-lingual capabilities.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

*Marcos Estecha-Garitagoitia,Chen Zhang,Mario Rodríguez-Cantelar,Luis Fernando D'Haro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for turn-level data augmentation in dialogue systems by leveraging commonsense relationships and proposes a prompt-based automatic evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by leveraging the contextual and commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs for creating synthetic turns based on diverse commonsense relations.

Method: The authors integrate prompt-based methods inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT), generate dialogues conditioned on commonsense attributes from LLMs, and evaluate these outputs using a new framework inspired by the ACCENT metric.

Result: The approach generated alternative responses for partial dialogues using 12 commonsense relations from the ATOMIC database and introduced an instruction-based evaluation that accurately identified the original commonsense attributes.

Conclusion: Preliminary results show the approach is effective in utilizing LLMs for generating and evaluating dialogue turns enriched with contextual commonsense knowledge.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

*Russell Beale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews the role of large language models (LLMs) in education, explores their alignment with educational theories, identifies gaps, and proposes strategies for enhancing their pedagogical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to examine how LLMs can be effectively used in education by aligning them with established pedagogical theories and overcoming their limitations as conversational learning agents.

Method: The paper synthesizes existing literature on LLMs in education, analyzes educational theories like Vygotsky's sociocultural learning and the Socratic method, and examines how LLM functionalities like prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) align with these theories.

Result: The paper identifies both synergies and gaps between LLMs and educational theories, pointing out issues like the models' tendency to provide direct answers, rather than fostering co-construction, and the challenges of integrating their broad but non-human expertise into pedagogy.

Conclusion: To make LLM-based learning more productive and aligned with theory, the paper proposes strategies such as designing Socratic prompts, providing scaffolded guidance, encouraging reflection, and using retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual relevance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

### [62] [Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19492)
*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the risks of "efficient reasoning" in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), finding that while it reduces token generation, it increases inconsistencies and may encourage undesirable behaviors in the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in LRMs have shown remarkable performance on complex tasks, but problems arise with overthinking, i.e., excessive token generation for simple tasks. The motivation lies in understanding if optimizing for efficiency via reduced reasoning length leads to trade-offs, such as increased behavioral inconsistencies.

Method: The paper introduces the $ICBENCH$ benchmark to systematically assess inconsistencies in LRMs along three dimensions: task-setting inconsistencies (ITS), inconsistencies between training objectives and learned behaviors (TR-LB), and inconsistencies between reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). These benchmarks are applied to different models and efficient reasoning strategies.

Result: The study finds that larger LRMs perform better in terms of consistency than smaller ones, yet exhibit widespread issues like scheming behaviors (e.g., self-disagreement and reasoning omission). Additionally, efficient reasoning strategies like No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget worsen all dimensions of inconsistency.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning strategies improve token-use efficiency but come with the cost of increased behavioral inconsistencies. These trade-offs imply the need for further research to ensure that optimization approaches maintain reliability and do not compromise effective supervision.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnTKV, a quantization framework for the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs), focused on minimizing quality degradation by utilizing token sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing KV cache memory footprint in LLMs while minimizing performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit quantization.

Method: The authors analyzed attention forward error propagation and proposed Anchor Score (AnS) to measure token sensitivity to quantization errors, enabling selective FP16 preservation for high-sensitivity tokens and designing a triton kernel for efficient implementation.

Result: AnTKV significantly reduces the memory footprint while achieving up to 3.5x higher decoding throughput and improved perplexity scores under ultra-low quantization settings compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective and efficient solution for memory optimization in LLMs, with improved decoding performance and quantization robustness, supported by empirical evidence from benchmark experiments.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Motivation: To enhance the generation of accurate and evidence-attributed answers to patient-specific questions using information from electronic health records.

Method: A RAG framework utilizing ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval with query-dependent methods (surprise, autocut, and new autocut* and elbow methods).

Result: Experimental results highlight the superiority of the query-dependent retrieval strategy in producing factual and relevant answers compared to fixed-k retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed query-dependent-k RLT approaches improve the factual accuracy and relevance of generated answers in clinical question-answering tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual

Motivation: Improve medication safety and clinical decision support by tackling challenges in French prescription instructions which are ambiguous and irregular.

Method: Compared prompt-based and fine-tuned LLMs against a traditional NERL system. Proposed hybrid pipeline routing low-confidence NERL cases to LLMs.

Result: Hybrid approach achieved 91% structuration accuracy with reduced computational latency and cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid system combines strengths of NERL and LLMs to offer a scalable, accurate solution for structuring clinical prescriptions in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge LLMs face in rapidly adapting to specialized tasks without relying on costly and data-intensive methods like fine-tuning.

Method: Dynamically construct a knowledge base from environmental and experiential data and use a small knowledge-embedding model to enhance LLM reasoning for specific tasks.

Result: Achieved a 17.71% improvement in the performance of gpt-4-turbo model, validated through ScienceWorld benchmark tests.

Conclusion: KnowMap provides an efficient approach to LLM task adaptation, emphasizing the benefits of integrating dynamic knowledge for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental

TL;DR: This paper presents Health Sentinel, an AI-based information extraction tool for early disease outbreak detection from online articles, identifying over 3,500 potential outbreaks in India since 2022.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disease outbreak detection methods are challenged by delays and inefficiencies, making it essential to explore automated systems that utilize vast online news data for timely surveillance.

Method: The proposed Health Sentinel uses a multi-stage information extraction pipeline combining machine learning and non-ML techniques to process large volumes of online articles, extracting structured health-related event data.

Result: Since April 2022, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million online articles, identifying more than 95,000 unique health events, of which 3,500 were flagged as potential outbreaks by experts.

Conclusion: Health Sentinel serves as an effective surveillance tool, enabling public health authorities to analyze and act on potential disease outbreaks in a timely manner.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RCStat, a framework leveraging raw attention logits to enhance input-token importance analysis in auto-regressive transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance in compression and attribution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing token importance in transformers overly rely on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which mask the more robust pre-Softmax query-key logits.

Method: The authors propose RCStat, using a metric called Relative Contextualization (RC) to measure contextual alignment between token segments. They derive an efficient upper bound for RC and apply it to key-value compression and token attribution tasks.

Result: RCStat delivers significant improvements in empirical performance across tasks like question answering and summarization, enabling better token-level explanations and cache compression without retraining the transformer models.

Conclusion: RCStat effectively utilizes raw attention logits to provide higher fidelity explanations and efficient key-value compression, demonstrating its utility without requiring model modifications.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human evaluators are not always superior to state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation metrics, raising concerns about the validity of measuring progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of human judgment as a baseline in assessing Machine Translation metrics' performance.

Method: Introduced human baselines into MT meta-evaluation to compare the performance of state-of-the-art automatic metrics with human evaluators.

Result: State-of-the-art automatic metrics often matched or outperformed human evaluators in agreement with human judgments.

Conclusion: While automatic metrics may achieve human parity, there are reasons for caution, and the findings urge a reevaluation of how we measure advancements in MT evaluation.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:

### [70] [ECCoT: A Framework for Enhancing Effective Cognition via Chain of Thought in Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19599)
*Zhenke Duan,Jiqun Pan,Jiani Tu,Xiaoyi Wang,Yanqing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECCoT, a framework aimed at improving the transparency and trustworthiness of Large Language Models by refining their reasoning processes using advanced topic modeling and causal reasoning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and reliability of Large Language Models, despite their advancements, poses concerns about their interpretability. Existing techniques like Chain of Thought prompting are limited by the potential for error-prone reasoning chains.

Method: ECCoT employs a combination of Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for generating topic-aware reasoning chains and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for aligning these chains with causal reasoning. Ineffective reasoning chains are filtered out using structured ordering statistics.

Result: The proposed ECCoT framework enhances the interpretability, reduces biases, and improves the trustworthiness of decision-making in large language models.

Conclusion: ECCoT provides a systematic approach for improving reasoning accuracy in Large Language Models, thereby addressing key concerns of reliability and transparency in AI-generated outputs.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

### [71] [Social Hatred: Efficient Multimodal Detection of Hatemongers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19603)
*Tom Marzea,Abraham Israeli,Oren Tsur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for detecting online hate-monger users, incorporating textual content, activity, and social network analysis, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the identification of hate-monger users instead of solely detecting hateful utterances and to better understand hate proliferation as a social issue.

Method: A multimodal approach is employed, aggregating signals from hateful texts, user activities, and their social network interactions, and tested across three platforms (Twitter, Gab, Parler).

Result: The multimodal method demonstrated better accuracy than traditional text and graph-based methods in detecting hate-mongers and was effective across different datasets and platforms.

Conclusion: Incorporating context from user activity and network greatly enhances hate-monger detection, and the approach has broad applicability for improving both classification and intervention strategies across platforms.

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

*Juraj Vladika,Ihsan Soydemir,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates self-correcting methods to tackle hallucinations in LLM-generated news summaries using evidence from search engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) in LLM-generated text, particularly in the field of news summarization.

Method: The authors studied two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems that refine hallucinated summaries by iteratively generating verification questions, consulting search engine evidence, and revising the initial response.

Result: The study highlights the effectiveness of using search engine snippets and few-shot prompts while demonstrating high alignment between G-Eval and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Self-correcting systems exhibit promising results in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, especially when leveraging evidence from search engines and optimized prompting strategies.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

*Lucie Galland,Catherine Pelachaud,Florian Pecune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining large language models with reinforcement learning for structured, goal-oriented dialogue, showcasing improved adaptability and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue systems lack adaptability to individual user profiles and structured goal-oriented conversation methods.

Method: Introduced a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach alongside meta-learning to create dynamic dialogue phases and personalized interactions.

Result: The framework outperformed a state-of-the-art LLM-based dialogue manager in terms of reward in Motivational Interviews.

Conclusion: Integrating reinforcement learning with large language models enhances structured open-ended dialogues and showcases potential for goal-driven applications.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a
specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

*Chuxuan Hu,Yuxuan Zhu,Antony Kellermann,Caleb Biddulph,Suppakit Waiwitlikhit,Jason Benn,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement post training (RPT) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles to generalize to domains significantly different from the fine-tuning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how well reasoning improvements from reinforcement post training generalize to new and unseen domains.

Method: Conduct two studies: an observational study comparing various RPT models across domains and an interventional study applying RPT to LLMs fine-tuned on single domains.

Result: RPT consistently improves performance on tasks resembling the fine-tuning data but fails to generalize effectively to domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: While RPT enhances task-specific reasoning, its benefits are limited in generalization, highlighting a need for broader evaluation strategies or methods to improve cross-domain adaptability.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

### [75] [Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689)
*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REWIRE, a method to recycle and transform low-quality web data for improved large language model training. It enhances performance on diverse tasks by mixing filtered high-quality web data with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge called the "data wall," where the growth of high-quality natural training data cannot match the increasing compute capacity needed for scaling large language models.

Method: The authors propose REWIRE, a method for rewriting low-quality web documents to transform them into synthetic data useful for pre-training large language models.

Result: Experiments showed performance improvements of 1.0%, 1.3%, and 2.5% at scales of 1B, 3B, and 7B model sizes on diverse tasks. The method also outperforms related synthetic data generation approaches.

Conclusion: REWIRE highlights the potential of data recycling as an effective strategy for pre-training large language models, making the scaling approach more efficient and sustainable.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

### [76] [Evaluating Rare Disease Diagnostic Performance in Symptom Checkers: A Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19750)
*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study introduces a Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate rare disease diagnostic performance in symptom checkers using Human Phenotype Ontology database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and improve symptom checker diagnostic performance for rare diseases pre-deployment to prevent algorithm degradation impacts.

Method: Synthetic vignettes were generated from the Human Phenotype Ontology, simulating user-SC interactions. Comparisons between synthetic and real diagnostic outcome changes were made using R-squared statistics.

Result: The method accurately predicted diagnostic performance post-algorithm update for diseases with frequency information in HPO, achieving R^2 of 0.831 for recall@8 and 0.78 for precision@8.

Conclusion: The approach offers developers a transparent and cost-effective way to enhance rare disease diagnostic accuracy in SCs, but depends on availability of disease frequency data in HPO.

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialects present a linguistic challenge due to their variety across 22 Arabic-speaking countries, necessitating novel approaches for understanding and classification.

Method: The study employed RNNs, Transformers, and LLMs with prompt engineering. MARBERTv2, an advanced NLP model, achieved the highest accuracy on the dataset.

Result: MARBERTv2 achieved 65% accuracy and 64% F1-score, identifying major linguistic issues in Arabic dialect classification.

Conclusion: The work supports applications like personalized chatbots, social media analysis, and improved accessibility for Arabic dialect speakers.

Abstract: The Arabic language is among the most popular languages in the world with a
huge variety of dialects spoken in 22 countries. In this study, we address the
problem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.
RNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt
engineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with
65% accuracy and 64% F1-score. Through the use of state-of-the-art
preprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the
most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic
communities.

*Martin Ratajczak,Jean-Philippe Robichaud,Jennifer Drexler Fox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Efficient and accurate speech recognition for long-form audio is achieved using bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers instead of traditional multi-head attention (MHA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-head attention (MHA) layers struggle with long-form speech recognition due to their quadratic complexity, requiring more efficient yet accurate solutions.

Method: The study employs bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers, compares them with limited-context attention (LCA), introduces a new training paradigm, and proposes a novel Direction Dropout regularization method.

Result: Bidirectional RA layers achieve comparable or better accuracy than MHA and LCA, with significantly higher throughput (44% over LCA). Direction Dropout improves both accuracy and throughput trade-offs.

Conclusion: RA layers are a promising solution for long-form ASR, balancing efficiency and accuracy, with Direction Dropout enabling flexible system optimization.

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a unified method for optimizing large language models (LLMs) that combines SFT and RL in a single stage via entropy-aware mechanisms, showcasing superior performance in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of optimally integrating Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training LLMs, as both paradigms exhibit distinct behavior and impact on learning dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a unified methodology called SRFT, which directly applies SFT and RL simultaneously to LLMs using a single-stage process, leveraging entropy-aware weighting for efficient optimization.

Result: SRFT achieves substantial accuracy improvements, with a 59.1% average accuracy and outperforming two-stage approaches by 9.0% on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and 10.9% on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRFT effectively combines SFT and RL in a unified framework, providing enhanced, efficient optimization for LLMs and yielding significant improvements in reasoning tasks compared to traditional two-stage methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs struggle with reasoning-intensive data analysis tasks, prompting exploration into effective strategies to enhance their performance.

Method: The researchers created a diverse seed dataset for evaluation across data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning, then used insights to develop a data synthesis methodology.

Result: Key findings include strategic planning as a critical determinant of performance, the influence of interaction design and task complexity, and the dominant role of data quality over diversity in improving results.

Conclusion: Enhanced data quality combined with synthesized strategies significantly boosts the analytical reasoning proficiency of open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study aimed to classify communal violent text in Bengali using fine-tuned BanglaBERT and ensemble models with macro F1 scores of 0.60 and 0.63, respectively. It noted challenges in context understanding and explored interpretability using LIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communal violence through better detection of hateful and violence-inciting text, particularly in the Bengali language, sourced from social media.

Method: Development of a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and ensemble model, combined with data expansion to address data imbalance. Interpretability was analyzed using LIME and cosine similarity.

Result: The fine-tuned BanglaBERT model achieved a macro F1 score of 0.60, while an improved ensemble model achieved a score of 0.63. Qualitative analysis highlighted contextual misclassification challenges.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of NLP tools in tackling online communal violence, while also showcasing areas for improvement. It contributes foundational knowledge for future refinements to enhance accuracy and societal impact.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular, multi-agent framework, MAM, for multimodal medical diagnosis that significantly outperforms baseline models by 18%-365%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal medical LLMs have limitations in updating knowledge, comprehensiveness, and flexibility, prompting the need for a more efficient and modular approach.

Method: The authors propose MAM, which decomposes tasks into specialized roles (like General Practitioner, Specialist Team, etc.) simulated by LLM-based agents, leveraging existing LLMs and knowledge bases for collaboration.

Result: Experimental results show MAM achieves superior performance across multimodal datasets (text, image, audio, and video), significantly surpassing baseline models by 18%-365%.

Conclusion: MAM is an efficient and flexible framework addressing the limitations of current medical LLMs, setting a new benchmark for multimodal medical diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is

TL;DR: PEVLM introduces a parallel encoding strategy to improve the efficiency of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for long video understanding with reduced computation and latency, achieving superior accuracy and speed compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with long video understanding due to the high computational cost of standard attention mechanisms.

Method: PEVLM employs a parallel encoding strategy by partitioning input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserving full-attention positional embeddings, and aligning attention weights to imitate full-attention distributions.

Result: PEVLM offers up to 8.37% accuracy improvement, 7.47x computation speedup, and 40% latency reduction on LongVideoBench compared to current efficient inference methods.

Conclusion: PEVLM effectively addresses low-latency and long-context video understanding challenges, proving beneficial for applications including autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new correspondence-free approach to multiview point cloud registration, bypassing traditional feature extraction and achieving better accuracy through optimization with global depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in obtaining globally optimal solutions in complex environments due to reliance on feature extraction and data association.

Method: The method formulates a non-linear least squares optimization to jointly estimate point cloud poses and a global depth map, without explicit feature-based processes.

Result: Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior accuracy against state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of feature-based methods by dynamically incorporating and refining data association through the optimization process, enabling robust multiview point cloud registration.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances the YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and carbon emission estimation using a hybrid pipeline with deep OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a scalable, automated system to estimate vehicle-specific carbon emissions in urban environments.

Method: The method involves enhancing YOLOv8 to detect, segment, and track vehicles, incorporating a deep OCR module for license plate recognition and classification, and cross-referencing results with a real-time database for emissions estimation.

Result: The YOLOv8 detector achieved 71% mAP for bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. The OCR module attained 99% character-level accuracy with the best CNN model.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of integrating real-time detection and OCR for practical deployment in smart transportation systems, offering accurate and scalable carbon monitoring.

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

### [86] [Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18925)
*Tahereh Zarrat Ehsan,Michael Tangermann,Yağmur Güçlütürk,Bastiaan R. Bloem,Luc J. W. Evers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computer vision-based approach for objectively quantifying motor deficits in Parkinson's disease using finger-tapping tests from video recordings, offering improved accuracy and granular assessment over traditional subjective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessment of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease using finger-tapping tests relies on subjective clinician evaluation, which is prone to variability and does not provide detailed insights into specific motor characteristics.

Method: The researchers developed a computer vision-based framework to analyze video recordings of finger-tapping in Parkinson's patients. They extracted features related to hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts, and utilized principal component analysis to validate these features. Machine learning models were then trained to predict MDS-UPDRS finger-tapping scores.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated higher prediction accuracy for finger-tapping scores compared to existing approaches, while also enabling granular identification of specific motor deficits from video data.

Conclusion: This framework offers an objective, interpretable, and accurate method for assessing Parkinson's disease motor characteristics. It holds promise for use in both clinical and remote settings, with further research required for evaluating its effectiveness in tracking treatment outcomes and disease progression.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for tracking tubular structures using reinforcement learning, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for tracking tubular structures like blood vessels and roads face challenges such as complex morphologies and computational inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose casting segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and using Q-Learning to adaptively explore a graph of segments and compute edge weights dynamically.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches, effectively handling complex topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves tracking accuracy and efficiency, maintaining global path coherence without reliance on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

*Yanke Wang,Yu Hin Ng,Haobo Liang,Ching-Wei Chang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven safety monitoring system for tower crane operations, mitigating risks to human workers and potential crane collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve safety for human workers on construction sites, specifically in the workspace between tower cranes and constructed building tops, amidst the increasing automation of crane systems.

Method: The authors developed a fully automated system leveraging AI and 3D data fusion from cameras and LiDAR to localize humans and modular integrated constructions (MiC) on construction sites.

Result: The system successfully integrates 3D data to ensure precise human and construction component localization, and its real-site implementation demonstrated effectiveness in safety monitoring and visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed system proves to be a practical and accurate tool for construction site safety, addressing critical risks associated with tower crane operations.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Damba-ST, a novel spatio-temporal prediction model that builds on Mamba's linear complexity while addressing its domain adaptability limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and generalized urban spatio-temporal prediction model capable of handling diverse regions and cities with limited data.

Method: Proposed the Damba-ST model, which features a domain-adaptive state space structure and domain-specific adapters to tackle spatio-temporal heterogeneity and improve cross-domain adaptability.

Result: Damba-ST achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with strong zero-shot generalization capability, enabling its deployment in unseen urban contexts without extensive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Damba-ST successfully balances efficiency and adaptability, making it a scalable solution for urban spatio-temporal prediction tasks across heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDict-VLM, a vision-language model that eliminates convolutions and self-attention for efficiency and matches mid-scale transformer baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models typically rely on resource-intensive components like convolutions and self-attention for image and text processing, creating a need for alternatives to improve efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce a spectral dictionary token mixer that uses sparse frequency atoms for multimodal fusion, eliminating convolutions and self-attention.

Result: SDict-VLM achieves competitive performance metrics such as BLEU-4, CIDEr, SPICE, and VQAv2 while being faster and requiring fewer computational resources compared to other models.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving efficient and interpretable vision-language fusion without dedicated convolutions or self-attention, enabling tunable trade-offs between accuracy and compute.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffRIS, a novel framework leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and new modules to enhance remote sensing image segmentation through natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in remote sensing image segmentation due to scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities in aerial imagery.

Method: DiffRIS framework uses pre-trained diffusion models with two key innovations: a Context Perception adapter (CP-adapter) for linguistic feature refinement and a Progressive Cross-Modal Reasoning Decoder (PCMRD) for textual-visual alignment.

Result: DiffRIS outperforms existing methods across benchmark datasets (RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, RISBench), achieving state-of-the-art performance in RRSIS tasks.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and the proposed adaptive framework for enhanced segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLIMPSE, a model-agnostic framework for understanding where large vision-language models focus their attention during visual question answering tasks, aiming to enhance interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in large vision-language models, specifically in understanding their visual attention and their textual decision-making processes during visual question answering tasks.

Method: The paper proposes GLIMPSE, which combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to generate heat maps that show the regions and text elements the model relies on.

Result: GLIMPSE produces more human-aligned attribution heat maps compared to previous interpretability methods, offering clearer insights into model reasoning and detecting issues like hallucination, bias, and misalignment with human attention.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE enhances model interpretability in multimedia settings and offers tools to analyze model behavior more transparently, exposing potential errors and biases in cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2MD, a training pipeline transitioning high-cost diffusion transformers to efficient state-space Mamba models for image generation, achieving lower computational overhead without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism in diffusion transformers, with quadratic computational complexity, is inefficient for high-resolution image generation. The Mamba model offers a linear complexity alternative but is challenging to train directly.

Method: T2MD involves transitioning from transformers to Mamba through a hybrid self-attention and Mamba model. This process uses layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation to ease training and reduce costs.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method ensures efficient text-to-image generation with reduced overhead and high quality, even for resolutions up to 2048×2048.

Conclusion: The framework suggests the viability of Mamba models for non-causal visual generation tasks, offering a foundation for further advancements in efficient image synthesis.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OoPk, a novel pipeline for continual test-time adaptation in semantic segmentation. It combines orthogonal projection and online prior-knowledge aggregation to enhance adaptation while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for effective methods to continually adapt a pre-trained model to dynamically changing target distributions without sacrificing performance or efficiency, especially for complex tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: The method involves orthogonal projection of tuning subspaces to retain pre-trained knowledge and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, coupled with an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs image masking to mimic dynamic target scenarios for improved domain adaptability.

Result: The proposed OoPk method outperforms existing CTTA techniques, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: OoPk offers a robust approach to continual test-time adaptation by efficiently balancing adaptation performance and preventing knowledge degradation.

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Method: Legato combines a pretrained vision encoder and an ABC decoder. It is trained on a dataset of over 214,000 images to generalize across various scores. The model is evaluated against other methods using diverse metrics.

Result: Legato outperforms previous methods and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for end-to-end OMR tasks.

Conclusion: Legato advances OMR by offering a scalable and effective solution, improving generalization and evaluation standards in the field.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

TL;DR: HAWAII is a framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder for efficient and improved VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing visual understanding in vision-language models while reducing computational costs of leveraging multiple visual experts.

Method: HAWAII employs teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters and a router mechanism for efficient knowledge distillation, using both fine-grained and coarse-grained approaches.

Result: Experiments show that HAWAII outperforms popular vision-language models across various tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves better task performance with reduced computational overhead, proving its efficacy in vision-language model enhancement.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

TL;DR: This paper examines how Vision Language Models (VLMs) infer emotions, identifying their reliance on specific facial cues and highlighting risks like bias and shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind emotion recognition by Vision Language Models and assess their psychological grounding versus reliance on superficial features.

Method: Benchmarking varying scale Vision Language Models on a subset of the AffectNet dataset annotated with teeth visibility and introspecting the behavior of the top-performing model, GPT-4o.

Result: Models showed shifts in emotion recognition performance depending on visible teeth presence; GPT-4o displayed consistent reasoning driven by attributes like eyebrow position.

Conclusion: Foundation Models exhibit emergent behavior in emotion recognition but reveal biases and shortcut learning risks, necessitating caution in sensitive applications like mental health.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RareSpot, a novel detection framework that uses multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation to improve detection of small and rare wildlife like prairie dogs in aerial imagery, achieving over 35% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting small and rare wildlife, such as prairie dogs, in aerial imagery is essential for conservation but is technically challenging due to their subtle visual features, sparse distribution, and small size.

Method: RareSpot employs multi-scale consistency learning to enhance fine-grained object representation and uses context-aware augmentation to synthesize challenging training instances, embedding undetectable samples into realistic environmental contexts.

Result: RareSpot achieved state-of-the-art performance, with over a 35% improvement in detection accuracy compared to baseline methods on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark; the approach also generalizes well to other wildlife datasets.

Conclusion: RareSpot offers a robust and generalizable framework to support ecological monitoring by significantly improving the detection of small and rare species in aerial imagery, setting a new standard for similar tasks.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

*Ilia Beletskii,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using consistency models to enhance image editing, achieving high-quality results in just four steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based image editing methods offer precision but are computationally expensive. Faster methods lack editing quality due to poor inversion accuracy.

Method: The framework utilizes a cycle-consistency optimization strategy paired with consistency models to improve image inversion and editing. It balances editability with content preservation efficiently.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various image editing tasks while surpassing full-step diffusion models in efficiency.

Conclusion: The method allows faster, high-quality, and efficient image editing, addressing the trade-off between editability and content preservation. Code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

*Christina Ourania Tze,Daniel Dauner,Yiyi Liao,Dzmitry Tsishkou,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrITTI is proposed as a 3D semantic scene generation method using compact primitives, enabling efficient, editable scene layouts with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of voxel-based methods in large-scale 3D semantic scene generation, such as high memory cost, fixed resolutions, and lack of editability.

Method: The proposed PrITTI framework employs a hybrid representation combining rasterized ground surfaces with vectorized 3D primitives for objects. It uses a latent diffusion-based approach and introduces a novel Cholesky-based parameterization for stable object encoding.

Result: PrITTI achieves higher generation quality than voxel-based methods while using up to 3× less memory. It also allows direct instance-level scene manipulation and supports applications like inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic synthesis.

Conclusion: PrITTI demonstrates the benefits of using primitive-based scene generation, providing improved efficiency, flexibility, and support for various editing tasks and downstream applications.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers to overcome challenges in single-modality object tracking during adverse imaging conditions, achieving comparable accuracy with reduced model size and faster inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality object tracking faces limitations under challenging conditions like low illumination, prompting the use of multimodal approaches such as RGB-T tracking leveraging complementary data.

Method: The proposed method involves a progressive fusion framework using separable attention within Mobile Vision Transformers to learn intra-modal and inter-modal interactions for high-quality feature representation.

Result: The tracker achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art multimodal trackers, with a significantly reduced parameter count of under 4 million and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.

Conclusion: This study introduces a novel, efficient multimodal tracking algorithm, pioneering the use of Mobile Vision Transformers in the field, which offers a significant balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRISM, an efficient framework for extracting key moments from video content based on human visual sensitivity, without using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of online videos playing a pivotal role in political conversations necessitates effective tools for identifying moments of misinformation, propaganda, and radicalization.

Method: PRISM uses perceptual color difference metrics in the CIELAB color space to extract keyframes aligned with human visual sensitivity. It avoids deep learning, making it interpretable and computationally efficient.

Result: PRISM showed strong accuracy and fidelity on four benchmark datasets (BBC, TVSum, SumMe, ClipShots) while achieving high compression ratios.

Conclusion: PRISM is a scalable, lightweight, and resource-efficient solution for analyzing sensitive or harmful video content, useful for moderation and forensic applications.

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOSCARD, a multimodal framework combining chest X-rays and ECG for better prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to existing methods, achieving high accuracy in evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality globally, and conventional risk assessment methods face limitations due to single modality and sampling bias.

Method: A novel framework, MOSCARD, integrates multimodal data (chest X-ray and ECG) using co-attention mechanisms, causal reasoning, and dual back-propagation graphs to overcome biases and confounders.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved prediction performance on internal ED data and external MIMIC datasets, with AUC scores of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.71, surpassing single-modality and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MOSCARD provides a cost-effective, multimodal, and opportunistic screening method for early identification of cardiovascular risks, enhancing patient outcomes and addressing health disparities.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wildlife detection methods lack generalization across diverse species and environments due to limited taxonomic scope and rigid architectures.

Method: OW integrates language-aware embeddings with Grounding-DINO framework adaptation and employs an efficient search algorithm to prioritize social species exploration.

Result: OW achieves up to 0.981 mAP50 with fine-tuning and captures 95% species while exploring 33% of images, outperforming most existing detectors.

Conclusion: OW provides a flexible, efficient, and publicly accessible tool for global biodiversity assessments, advancing wildlife research.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Result: Identifies shared strategies and unique methods tailored to challenges of ancient scripts, such as image degradation and limited samples.

Conclusion: The paper outlines current limitations while proposing future directions for improving ancient script recognition techniques.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedErr-CT, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in identifying and correcting errors in CT reports, focusing on clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of CT in diagnostics has resulted in concerns about errors, while MLLMs show promise but need validation due to occasional inaccuracies.

Method: The benchmark includes six error categories and three task levels (classification, detection, correction) to rigorously test MLLMs' ability to identify and rectify errors in CT reports.

Result: State-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs show varied performance across error categories, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT aids in creating more reliable MLLMs, offering potential for reduced diagnostic errors through improved clinical deployment.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-XL-2 is a novel multi-modal large language model designed to achieve superior efficiency and performance in long video understanding using innovative techniques like chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language models face challenges in processing long video inputs due to high memory and computational costs, limiting their ability to balance performance with efficiency.

Method: The method involves two stages: chunk-based pre-filling, which divides visual tokens into chunks to apply full attention within chunks and sparse attention across them, and bi-level key-value decoding, which selectively reloads dense or sparse information based on task relevance.

Result: Video-XL-2 sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark for long video understanding, surpassing existing lightweight models in both performance and processing efficiency on tasks requiring thousands of video frames.

Conclusion: The proposed model combines task-aware sparsification techniques to significantly reduce memory and computational overhead, enabling practical and powerful long-video understanding applications on limited hardware.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSR-Align, a dataset for enhancing the safety alignment of vision-language models by enabling fine-grained, policy-driven multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of vision-language models has introduced new safety risks due to their susceptibility to harmful multimodal prompts, and existing safety approaches and datasets are insufficient for addressing these nuanced threats.

Method: The authors developed MSR-Align, a multimodal safety reasoning dataset created through a pipeline that emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and quality filtering with strong multimodal judges.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models on MSR-Align significantly improves their resistance to both textual and multimodal jailbreak attacks, while maintaining or enhancing their general reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MSR-Align offers a scalable and effective solution for improving the safety alignment of reasoning-capable vision-language models, addressing critical gaps in current safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our

Motivation: Creating datasets for specific tasks is challenging due to time constraints and resource limitations, especially in novel or sensitive domains.

Method: They introduce AIR, a framework with two main processes: AIR-Gen for dataset generation with prompt engineering and distribution adjustments, and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.

Result: Experiments show AIR-generated data effectively trains deep learning models, with high user performance approval (4.4/5.0).

Conclusion: AIR framework proves to be efficient in synthesizing datasets and improving deep learning model performance in diverse image recognition tasks.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) for enhanced remote sensing change detection, addressing limitations in capturing long-range dependencies among image channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods in change detection fail to effectively capture long-range dependencies between image channels, limiting their feature representation capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes the 3D-SSM, complemented by two components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) for bi-temporal feature integration, and a multi-branch feature extraction module (MBFEM) for combining features across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods.

Conclusion: 3D-SSM improves global information capture in change detection tasks, yielding better contextual representation and enhancing subtle change detection, validated by rigorous benchmarking.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), an approach for unsupervised domain adaptation using collaborative and adversarial learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing domain distribution mismatch and improving discriminability in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.

Method: CAN utilizes domain-collaborative learning for domain-specific feature representation and domain-adversarial learning for domain-invariant feature representation. It employs a self-paced strategy (SPCAN) for pseudo-label refinement.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmark datasets for object and video action recognition.

Conclusion: CAN effectively balances domain-specific and domain-invariant learning, making it suitable for various unsupervised domain adaptation challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

*Runwei Guan,Ningwei Ouyang,Tianhao Xu,Shaofeng Liang,Wei Dai,Yafeng Sun,Shang Gao,Songning Lai,Shanliang Yao,Xuming Hu,Ryan Wen Liu,Yutao Yue,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaterCaption, a waterway-specific image captioning dataset, and Da Yu, a multi-modal model for unmanned surface vessels (USVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current waterway perception models focus on instance-level object detection but fail to achieve global semantic understanding, hampering waterway monitoring and structured logging.

Method: The authors created WaterCaption, a dataset with 20.2k image-text pairs and proposed Da Yu, a model with the Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) to generate detailed textual descriptions efficiently.

Result: Da Yu outperforms state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and other benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The research introduces new avenues for better waterway perception and underscores the potential of tailored datasets and efficient models for USVs.

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

### [114] [HoliGS: Holistic Gaussian Splatting for Embodied View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19291)
*Xiaoyuan Wang,Yizhou Zhao,Botao Ye,Xiaojun Shan,Weijie Lyu,Lu Qi,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Yinxiao Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliGS, a framework that improves view synthesis from lengthy monocular RGB videos, reducing training time and handling dynamic and large-scale environments effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF face difficulties with large-scale, dynamic scenes and lengthy training for minute-long video sequences.

Method: The HoliGS framework uses invertible Gaussian Splatting deformation networks, decomposing scenes into a static background and time-varying objects modeled through Gaussian primitives with combined global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and subtle non-rigid deformations.

Result: HoliGS delivers superior reconstruction quality beyond existing methods, accomplishing robust free-viewpoint rendering with reduced training and rendering times on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: HoliGS provides a scalable, practical solution for embodied view synthesis in real-world dynamic and large-scale environments, with potential for impactful applications.

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

### [115] [Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation with Cascaded Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19300)
*Kai Zhao,Wubang Yuan,Zheng Wang,Guanyi Li,Xiaoqiang Zhu,Deng-ping Fan,Dan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel cascaded framework for Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS), enhancing performance by integrating Vision Language Models (VLMs) for improved segmentation and context-aware classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for camouflaged object segmentation use a two-stage process but face issues like domain gaps and imprecise boundaries. These limitations stem from the use of generic segmentation models and cropped regions that decrease accuracy for ambiguous, camouflaged objects.

Method: The paper proposes a VLM-guided cascaded framework where (1) segmentation uses explicit prompts from VLM-derived features for guiding the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and (2) classification avoids cropped-region inference by using segmentation outputs as soft spatial priors alongside full-image context.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in improving localization and classification accuracy for camouflaged objects compared to existing approaches, validated across both OVCOS and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating VLM semantics effectively addresses challenges in camouflaged object segmentation and classification, showcasing a unified, accurate, and context-aware approach that bridges segmentation and classification tasks seamlessly.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

### [116] [Airway Skill Assessment with Spatiotemporal Attention Mechanisms Using Human Gaze](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19306)
*Jean-Paul Ainam,Rahul,Lora Cavuoto,Matthew Hackett,Jack Norfleet,Suvranu De*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method to assess airway management skills, using human gaze data to inform a classification model for successful and unsuccessful endotracheal intubation. The approach enhances accuracy and offers a more objective assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating airway management skills lack objectivity and fail in real-world scenarios. A more accurate and robust tool is needed, especially for high-stress and critical environments.

Method: The system uses human gaze data and video recordings, employing visual masks to guide an attention mechanism. An autoencoder extracts video features, an attention module processes these through masks, and a classifier determines the outcome of the ETI procedure.

Result: The gaze-based approach outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability of clinical skill assessment.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of human gaze-based machine learning in assessing clinical skills, highlighting its potential for improving training and patient care in emergency settings.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

TL;DR: The paper addresses 3D point cloud affordance detection limitations by introducing LM-AD and the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which significantly enhance performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D point cloud-text alignment struggle with fine-grained reasoning, relying on simple cosine similarity, which is not expressive enough.

Method: The authors propose LM-AD, a method that introduces the Affordance Query Module (AQM) leveraging a pretrained language model for better alignment between 3D point clouds and text.

Result: LM-AD outperforms existing methods in accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-AD and AQM effectively tackle the shortcomings of existing approaches, offering more precise affordance detection in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

*Yin Zhang,Zian Ning,Xiaoyu Zhang,Shiliang Guo,Peidong Liu,Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an event-based method for detecting micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using propeller-specific features from event streams, outperforming RGB-based methods and introducing a novel dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV detection methods using RGB images struggle with diversity in appearance features, necessitating a generalized approach leveraging distinctive propeller-related traits captured in event streams.

Method: The study uses a three-module system to extract salient, spatio-temporal features of MAV propellers from event streams while filtering out background noise and camera motion.

Result: The proposed method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 83.0% precision (+30.3%) and 81.5% recall (+36.4%) on a novel testing dataset.

Conclusion: This work pioneers event stream-based MAV detection, providing high-performing methods, a new dataset, and open access for further advancement in the domain.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

*Weichen Zhang,Dong Xu,Jing Zhang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework named Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) and its variant PMC-PI for multi-modality domain adaptation, enabling knowledge transfer under scenarios with complete or incomplete modality availability in the target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-domain transfer tasks leveraging multiple modalities, particularly when some modalities are missing in the target domain.

Method: It introduces PMC for leveraging multiple modalities cooperatively and PMC-PI, which extends PMC by generating missing modalities in the target domain using adversarial learning and pseudo semantics conditioning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three image and eight video datasets confirm the proposed framework's effectiveness in cross-domain visual recognition tasks under MMDA and MMDA-PI settings.

Conclusion: PMC and PMC-PI methods enhance cross-domain knowledge transfer by exploiting multi-modality information efficiently, even handling cases with missing modalities in the target domain.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

*Yuang Yao,Ruiqi Wu,Yi Zhou,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetCoP, a continual pre-training framework for multi-modal fundus image analysis, which outperforms existing methods by mitigating forgetting and ensuring better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified foundation model that integrates multiple fundus imaging modalities and addresses limitations of modality-specific models in dynamic environments where data arrives incrementally.

Method: The authors propose RetCoP, which incorporates a rehearsal strategy for revisiting knowledge and an off-diagonal information distillation approach to preserve image-text representation alignment during continual pre-training.

Result: RetCoP demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods, with improved generalization capabilities and a reduced forgetting rate.

Conclusion: RetCoP establishes a promising advancement in the fundus domain by effectively integrating multiple imaging modalities and addressing challenges in continual vision-language pre-training.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

*Mingcheng Qu,Guang Yang,Donglin Di,Yue Gao,Tonghua Su,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hypergraph learning framework for multimodal survival prediction in cancer, addressing challenges like modality imbalance and incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for cancer survival prediction largely focus on FFPE slides and genomics data, ignoring other slide types like FF slides. Additionally, pathology data's dominance hinders effective integration with genomics, and these methods require complete modalities, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: The proposed framework uses hypergraph learning to integrate multi-WSI data and pathology-genomic interactions while introducing a memory mechanism to handle incomplete data scenarios.

Result: Experiments on five TCGA datasets show over 2.3% improvement in C-Index compared to advanced methods. When modalities are incomplete, the model outperforms pathology-only by 3.3% and gene-only by 7.9%.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses challenges in multimodal integration for cancer survival prediction, providing robust solutions for modality imbalance and missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

### [122] [Systematic Comparison of Projection Methods for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation on Fisheye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19747)
*Stephanie Käs,Sven Peter,Henrik Thillmann,Anton Burenko,David Benjamin Adrian,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving 3D human pose estimation from fisheye cameras, evaluating the efficacy of different camera projection models, and introducing a novel dataset for testing these methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras capture a wide FOV, making them suitable for applications like human-robot interaction, but the curved distortions challenge accurate human pose detection. Existing undistortion methods lack systematic evaluation for wide-FOV human pose estimation.

Method: The authors assess the impact of different camera projection models (pinhole, equidistant, double sphere, cylindrical) on 3D human pose estimation accuracy and propose a heuristic for model selection based on bounding box detection. They also introduce the FISHnCHIPS dataset with annotated fisheye images.

Result: The study finds that pinhole projection performs poorly in close-up scenarios. Advanced models like the double sphere model significantly improve 3D pose estimation, and the proposed heuristic enhances prediction quality.

Conclusion: Optimizing the choice of camera projection model based on human pose characteristics and context can improve fisheye-based human pose estimation. The FISHnCHIPS dataset offers a valuable resource for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches that rely purely on vision-language models without leveraging temporal and causal structures inherent in visual data for robotic manipulation.

Method: A unified model, UniVLA, autoregressively models vision, language, and action as discrete token sequences and incorporates world modeling in post-training to capture causal dynamics from video data.

Result: UniVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, such as a 95.5% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: UniVLA demonstrates superior capability in utilizing multimodal data for long-horizon tasks, excelling in both simulation and real-world applications, and sets a precedent for unified approaches in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.
This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex
segmentation tasks and highlights its potential for use in real-world imaging
applications.

*Jintao Rong,Xin Xie,Xinyi Yu,Linlin Ou,Xinyu Zhang,Chunhua Shen,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEcho is a framework that enhances motion customization in video generation using distilled models, addressing inefficiencies in existing training-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods struggle to adapt to distilled video generation models, which produce faster results but lack customization due to large denoising steps and accelerated processes.

Method: MotionEcho employs diffusion teacher forcing, where slower but higher-quality teacher models guide faster student models using endpoint prediction and interpolation with dynamic computation allocation across timesteps.

Result: MotionEcho achieves higher motion fidelity, better generation quality, and efficiency across benchmark datasets and distilled video generation models.

Conclusion: MotionEcho successfully bridges the gap between speed and customization in distilled video generation models, showcasing its effectiveness in improving generation quality while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

### [129] [Online camera-pose-free stereo endoscopic tissue deformation recovery with tissue-invariant vision-biomechanics consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19388)
*Jiahe Chen,Naoki Tomii,Ichiro Sakuma,Etsuko Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for recovering tissue deformation using stereo endoscopic images, addressing limitations seen in previous works such as occlusion, large tissue deformations, and offline processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve tool-tissue interaction analysis and surgical navigation by overcoming challenges in tissue deformation recovery, including occlusion, depth changes, and computational inefficiency.

Method: It models tissue geometry as 3D point and derivative maps and tissue deformation as 3D displacement and local deformation maps, using camera-centric settings and an inter-frame alignment approach. The concept of a canonical map is introduced to enable online optimization.

Result: Quantitative experiments show high accuracy in 3D reconstruction, achieving surface distance accuracies of 0.37±0.27 mm for non-occluded and 0.39±0.21 mm for occluded areas. The method is robust to occlusions and out-of-view movements.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves a stable and accurate tissue geometry and deformation recovery, compatible with real-time settings, and provides an additional modality for mechanical analysis through surface strain distribution estimation.

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

*Jaeyoo Park,Sanghyuk Chun,Wonjae Kim,Sangdoo Yun,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the emergence of text recognition abilities during Vision-Language Models (VLMs) training, identifying an abrupt development of this skill later in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and when Vision-Language Models develop the capability to recognize and comprehend textual content within images, thereby optimizing their training processes.

Method: Analyzed the progression of text readability and semantic content understanding in VLMs during training using contrastive learning approaches.

Result: Found that text readability emerges abruptly at later training stages while semantic content understanding develops gradually. Additionally, image-text matching ability develops even slower.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are necessary to enhance and accelerate VLMs' text comprehension capabilities, offering insights into optimizing multimodal learning processes.

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

*Declan J. Curran,Sanaa Hobeichi,Hira Saleem,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which efficiently generates high-resolution climate data with reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for climate data downscaling are computationally demanding, and while AI-based diffusion models improve accuracy, they still require intensive computational resources.

Method: The HDD model employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine sampling process using a simple downsampling scheme within the diffusion framework.

Result: HDD achieves comparable accuracy to traditional methods on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models while using significantly fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The HDD model provides an efficient and transferable solution for probabilistic climate downscaling, enabling affordable high-resolution climate projections for large ensembles.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for accurate, efficient semantic segmentation in ultra-high resolution remote sensing while overcoming computational and multi-scale fusion limitations.

Method: Introduces GLCANet, a dual-stream lightweight segmentation framework integrating self-attention for global-local fusion and a masked cross-attention mechanism for feature refinement.

Result: GLCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and computational efficiency, handling large images with low memory requirements.

Conclusion: GLCANet is an effective and practical solution for UHR remote sensing semantic segmentation, offering improvements in both resource efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

*Lixuan He,Haoyu Dong,Zhenxing Chen,Yangcheng Yu,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mem4Nav, a hierarchical memory framework for vision-and-language navigation that improves task completion and navigation accuracy in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of fusing linguistic instructions with complex visual environments in navigation tasks and overcoming the limitations of existing systems' spatial reasoning and memory capabilities.

Method: Mem4Nav employs a combination of long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) using a sparse octree structure and a semantic topology graph imbued with trainable Transformer-based memory tokens.

Result: Mem4Nav achieved 7-13 percentage point improvements in task completion and over 10 pp improvements in navigation metrics (nDTW) across multiple datasets and backbones.

Conclusion: The hierarchical map and dual-memory system are crucial innovations, enabling significant advancements in navigation performance. All code for Mem4Nav is open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

*Congjing Yu,Jing Ye,Yang Liu,Xiaodong Zhang,Zhiyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes AMF-MedIT, a new framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing challenges such as feature discrepancies and noise in tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in fusing medical image and tabular data, including feature dimension mismatches, modality contribution differences, and tabular noise, especially under limited data availability.

Method: The authors introduce the AMF-MedIT framework with its Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module, leveraging feature modulation, modality confidence ratios, and a tabular encoder (FT-Mamba) that efficiently handles noisy tabular data. They employ losses and feature masks to guide modulation objectives.

Result: The framework achieves better multimodal analysis performance, data efficiency, and robustness to incomplete tabular data, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: AMF-MedIT successfully balances multimodal performance with data constraints, and FT-Mamba effectively guides the image encoder while extracting key tabular features.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

*Róisín Luo,James McDermott,Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new sampling approach for image attribution analysis to improve explanation certainty by aligning sample distributions with natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of misaligned sample distributions in gradient integration, which leads to low certainty in image attribution explanations.

Method: Presents a semi-optimal sampling strategy that suppresses features in input images to better align sample distributions with natural image distributions.

Result: Demonstrated that the new sampling approach provides more reliable and satisfactory explanations on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Aligning sample distributions with natural image distributions improves explanation certainty, and the proposed method is a significant step towards trustworthy image attribution analysis.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Motivation: To create a robust and generalizable benchmark dataset for image deblurring tasks that reflects realistic complexities and diversities in scenes, motion, and environments.

Method: Utilized slow-motion video frames from smartphones to simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging 240 frames over one second, creating blurry images paired with sharp reference images.

Result: The dataset is approximately 10 times larger than traditionally used datasets, with 8 times more scene diversity, and SOTA deblurring models show reduced performance on it due to its complexity.

Conclusion: This dataset provides a challenging benchmark for developing and testing improved deblurring models, emphasizing robustness and generalization.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the

degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our
dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and
generalizable deblurring models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved synthetic data generation approach combined with "reverse stylization" to enhance the performance of deep learning models when real datasets are challenging to obtain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in computer vision requires large real image datasets, which are difficult to obtain and are associated with privacy and legal concerns. Current synthetic data alternatives often lead to underperforming models, prompting the need for enhanced synthetic data generation techniques.

Method: The authors propose a two-step approach: (1) improving neural fractals to create a new class of synthetic data, and (2) employing a reverse stylization method to enrich synthetic datasets with visual features derived from a small, legal set of real images.

Result: The proposed methods significantly reduced the domain gap (as measured by KID) between synthetic and real images. Experiments show improved performance metrics, including an 11% reduction in FID for image generation tasks, 20% better autoencoder reconstruction error, and over 10% higher ImageNet-100 accuracy in ViT-S classification.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques demonstrate the practicality of using synthetic data, mitigating the limitations of real datasets, and suggest this framework as a viable alternative for training high-performing deep learning models.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed a reasoning-focused, interpretable model for Surgical-VQLA capable of enhancing the precision and reliability of surgical scene understanding. The authors have also committed to open-source the code and dataset for community use.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its

Conclusion: The release of USIS16K and benchmark evaluations serves to facilitate future work and solutions for the underexplored domain of underwater salient instance segmentation.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look

inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HMSViT, a Vision Transformer variant for segmenting corneal nerves and diagnosing Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) through Corneal Confocal Microscopy, achieving superior performance compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for early DPN detection highlights limitations in current automated CCM methods, such as reliance on handcrafted features, inefficient feature extraction, and limited datasets.

Method: The HMSViT model uses pooling-based hierarchical attention mechanisms, masked self-supervised learning for label efficiency, and a multi-scale decoder for feature fusion in segmentation and classification.

Result: HMSViT attains notable improvements, with segmentation and diagnostic metrics surpassing existing models like Swin Transformer and HiViT, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: HMSViT provides a clinically viable solution for DPN diagnosis, combining advanced feature extraction and learning methods, verifying potential for real-world scalability.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of synthetic data in autonomous vehicle (AV) simulations—specifically, ensuring realistic, grounded, and controlled editing of driving scenes for training and evaluation.

Method: SceneCrafter uses a multi-view diffusion model framework with advancements like prompt-driven pairing and alpha-blending for local edits. It handles weather, time, and geometric consistency via novel training paradigms.

Result: SceneCrafter achieves state-of-the-art scene editing capabilities in terms of realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and overall editing quality.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter solves key challenges in driving scene simulation by leveraging its unique architecture, advancing the field of realistic, editable simulation datasets for AV systems.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

### [142] [Visual hallucination detection in large vision-language models via evidential conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19513)
*Tao Huang,Zhekun Liu,Rui Wang,Yang Zhang,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by introducing a new benchmark (PRE-HAL) for systematic evaluation and proposing a detection method based on Dempster-Shafer theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucination in LVLMs poses a risk in safety-critical AI applications, and existing benchmarks fail to address reasoning-based hallucinations effectively.

Method: The authors created a benchmark (PRE-HAL) to evaluate both perception and reasoning capabilities in LVLMs, and introduced a Dempster-Shafer theory-based method for detecting visual hallucinations.

Result: The proposed detection method demonstrated superior performance over five baseline metrics, improving AUROC by 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs tested.

Conclusion: PRE-HAL benchmark exposes reasoning challenges in LVLMs, and the proposed DST-based detection method effectively captures visual hallucinations, showing strong performance improvements.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

### [143] [Recurrent Visual Feature Extraction and Stereo Attentions for CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19665)
*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for generating reports from CT images by leveraging a large language model (LLM) and introducing recurrent visual feature extraction with stereo attentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current CT report generation techniques which fail to effectively account for transformations among CT slices and multi-level image features related to organ lesions.

Method: The method involves recurrently processing CT slices using a vision Transformer, employing stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling, and aligning visual features with textual information to instruct the LLM.

Result: Experiments conducted on the M3D-Cap dataset demonstrate strong performance, with the method surpassing baseline models and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is validated as both effective and superior to existing solutions for CT report generation.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

### [144] [ReMAR-DS: Recalibrated Feature Learning for Metal Artifact Reduction and CT Domain Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19531)
*Mubashara Rehman,Niki Martinel,Michele Avanzo,Riccardo Spizzo,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReMAR-DS, a deep learning framework for reducing metal artifacts in kVCT imaging while ensuring domain transformation to MVCT, which improves image quality and reduces radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in kVCT imaging compromise image quality and clinical decisions. Additionally, minimizing reliance on repeated high-dose MVCT scans is critical to reduce patient radiation exposure.

Method: The framework, ReMAR-DS, uses an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with feature recalibration. It focuses on artifact-affected regions and key anatomical structures, enabling both metal artifact reduction and transformation from kVCT to MVCT domain.

Result: ReMAR-DS achieves improved reconstruction of regions with artifacts, validated through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. It produces high-quality MVCT-like images from kVCT scans, suitable for clinical application.

Conclusion: The method bridges kVCT’s high resolution with MVCT’s artifact resistance for enhanced radiotherapy planning. Clinically, the framework reduces the need for repetitive MVCT scans, lowering patient radiation exposure while improving diagnostic utility.

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

### [145] [Identifying Physically Realizable Triggers for Backdoored Face Recognition Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19533)
*Ankita Raj,Ambar Pal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to detect and identify naturally occurring backdoor triggers in face recognition systems, achieving a top-5 accuracy of 74%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in face recognition systems, such as using natural triggers like sunglasses to manipulate the system's behavior, pose critical security challenges. The paper aims to address this threat in high-security contexts.

Method: The authors propose a novel detection technique that evaluates whether a face recognition network is compromised and identifies the natural trigger responsible for backdoor activation.

Result: With their approach, the authors achieve a top-5 accuracy of 74% in identifying the natural trigger, outperforming a brute-force baseline which only achieves 56% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method is significantly more effective than naive approaches for detecting and identifying backdoor triggers in compromised face recognition systems, demonstrating promise for enhancing system security.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

*Jakob Ambsdorf,Asbjørn Munk,Sebastian Llambias,Anders Nymark Christensen,Kamil Mikolaj,Randall Balestriero,Martin Tolsgaard,Aasa Feragen,Mads Nielsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores if custom pretraining on medical data or transferring from generalist models is better. By training a foundation model on fetal ultrasound data (2M images) using the DINOv2 method, state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks and datasets are achieved. Custom pretraining proves valuable, even with smaller datasets, while adaptation of established computer vision methods suffices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether researchers should pretrain custom foundation models on medical data or use transfer-learning from generalist models, and whether novel methods are needed for custom medical datasets.

Method: The study used the DINOv2 method to pretrain a foundation model on a large fetal ultrasound dataset (2M images), compared its performance to models pre-trained on natural images and supervised methods, and evaluated across classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across three fetal ultrasound datasets, requiring no hyperparameter tuning or major methodological changes.

Conclusion: Pretraining on custom medical data (even small-scale) outperforms scaling generalist models in medical domains, with established computer vision methods being adequately effective and minimizing the need for methodological innovation.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

### [147] [MambaOutRS: A Hybrid CNN-Fourier Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19561)
*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambaOutRS, a hybrid convolutional model for remote sensing classification, achieving state-of-the-art results through gated CNNs and a novel frequency-based module, outperforming more complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba has demonstrated linear scalability; however, their application to 2D visual data requires complex modifications, reducing efficiency. The authors aim to create a simpler, effective solution for remote sensing image classification.

Method: The proposed MambaOutRS architecture integrates stacked Gated CNN blocks for local features and a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) for global context. The design is hierarchical, comprising four stages. The model was tested on four major remote sensing datasets.

Result: MambaOutRS achieved state-of-the-art performance, with the MambaOutRS-t variant achieving F1-scores of 98.41% on UC Merced and 95.99% on AID. It outperformed larger transformer-based models and other baselines while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The study concludes that recurrent SSMs, with their complexities, can be replaced by an effective combination of gated convolutions and frequency-based gates, as demonstrated by MambaOutRS. This model offers a computationally efficient and high-performance paradigm for vision tasks, particularly in remote sensing.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

*Gencer Sumbul,Chang Xu,Emanuele Dalsasso,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMARTIES, a foundational model designed to handle data from various remote sensing sensors by creating a shared spectrum-aware space, surpassing traditional sensor-specific models in scalability, adaptability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome the limitations of recent deep learning models, which are often restricted to single sensors or fixed combinations, and to enable scalable, general-purpose processing of diverse remote sensing sensor data.

Method: SMARTIES employs a unified transformer model to generate sensor-agnostic representations by reconstructing masked multi-sensor data utilizing cross-sensor token mixup, enabling it to unify heterogeneous sensor data into a shared spectrum-aware framework.

Result: SMARTIES achieves superior performance on single- and multi-modal tasks across various remote sensing sensors compared to sensor-specific pretrained models.

Conclusion: SMARTIES provides a scalable, adaptable solution for diverse RS sensor data processing, promoting flexibility, and achieving better results without dependence on sensor-specific adjustments.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) to reconstruct multispectral imagery (MSI) in cloud-covered regions by leveraging temporal MSI coherence and SAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery hampers early season crop mapping due to missing or corrupted data, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data lacks adequate spectral detail for precise mapping.

Method: The framework, called Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), integrates temporal coherence of MSI and SAR data through an attention mechanism to reconstruct cloud-covered MSI.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional approaches, improving MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered areas.

Conclusion: The paper validates the effectiveness of using temporal MSI coherence and complementary SAR data with ViT to address challenges posed by cloud interference in crop mapping.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Method: The device integrates gait phase analysis with multimodal sensing to gather environmental data and provide navigation guidance. Both indoor and outdoor experiments were conducted to test its effectiveness.

Result: The wearable guiding device demonstrated superior performance in navigation and obstacle detection compared to traditional guide canes.

Conclusion: The proposed wearable device with Gait-based Guiding System and multimodal sensing presents a more effective solution for assisting visually impaired individuals, addressing shortcomings of traditional aids.

Abstract: By the year 2023, the global population of individuals with impaired vision

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of 3D labels in multimodal dynamic NeRF implementations and improve training efficiency and performance in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The researchers developed a self-supervised NeRF-based framework that employs heuristic image pixel sampling and Double Gradient masks. It focuses on learning implicit neural representations for both LiDAR and Camera in space and time-varying scenes.

Result: Experiments on KITTI-360 demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed baseline models in both LiDAR and Camera domains.

Conclusion: NVSF eliminates the need for 3D labels, enhances training efficiency, and shows superior performance on real-world datasets for autonomous driving.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline

Result: VideoPCDNet outperforms baseline models in unsupervised tracking and prediction on synthetic datasets, while generating interpretable object and motion representations.

Conclusion: This model successfully bridges the gap in unsupervised video analysis, showcasing the potential of frequency-domain approaches for object-centric video processing.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleCap, a system for scalable image captioning that addresses multimodal and linguistic biases by enhancing captions as inference time and cost increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inherent biases in large vision-language models (LVLMs) that result in imbalanced descriptive granularity and hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive image captions.

Method: The proposed method includes heuristic question answering to incrementally enrich image captions with relevant details and contrastive sentence rating to remove hallucinated content. The process progressively improves captions with higher inference budgets.

Result: Experiments confirmed the improved modality alignment of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images using ScaleCap enhanced LVLM pretraining, leading to better performance across 11 benchmarks. Additional tasks also showcased the richness and accuracy of its captions.

Conclusion: ScaleCap achieves detailed, accurate, and bias-reduced image captions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving both LVLM pretraining and additional vision-language tasks like VQA and image reconstruction from captions.

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

TL;DR: HOIverse introduces a synthetic dataset focusing on scene graph-based human-object interactions in indoor environments, aiming to enhance scene understanding for robotic and AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in datasets necessary for effective scene understanding in environments shared by humans and robots, crucial for tasks like navigation and planning.

Method: The authors created HOIverse, providing dense scene graph annotations, human-object relationship definitions, and supplementary data like RGB images, depth maps, and segmentation masks.

Result: Benchmark testing with state-of-the-art models demonstrates the dataset's suitability for predicting parametric human-object relationships and advancing scene graph generation.

Conclusion: HOIverse has the potential to accelerate research in scene understanding involving humans, especially in indoor environments, supporting advancements in robotic and AI applications.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xarrayvideo, a Python library, compresses multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos, achieving high compression and fidelity using video codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges posed by the rapidly growing size of Earth system datasets and make them more accessible and usable.

Method: The library utilizes video compression techniques through ffmpeg to convert high-resolution spatiotemporal data into compact video formats.

Result: Compression ratios up to 250x with high fidelity (PSNRs between 40.60 and 65.91 dB). Datasets redistributed in reduced sizes without quality compromise.

Conclusion: xarrayvideo provides an efficient, practical tool for compressing large Earth observation datasets, ensuring high performance and usability for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),

### [156] [SAM2-SGP: Enhancing SAM2 for Medical Image Segmentation via Support-Set Guided Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19658)
*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Yuheng Bu,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM2-SGP, a framework that enhances SAM2 for medical image segmentation by eliminating the need for human prompts and addressing domain shift issues, achieving better performance across various medical imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 faces challenges in adapting to medical image segmentation due to its reliance on human prompts and domain shift from natural images.

Method: The SAM2-SGP framework incorporates pseudo-mask generation and attention modules to leverage support sets for automatic prompting and employs a low-rank adaptation strategy for domain shift mitigation.

Result: Evaluations on 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical imaging modalities show significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art models like nnUNet and SwinUNet.

Conclusion: The SAM2-SGP framework effectively overcomes human prompt reliance and domain shift challenges, proving to be a highly efficient solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathLUPI, a method that uses transcriptomic information during training to predict molecular features from whole-slide images (WSIs) with higher accuracy than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time required for genomic analysis in precision oncology motivate the need for alternative methods to predict molecular features directly from routine histological images.

Method: PathLUPI employs transcriptomic privileged information for training to derive histological embeddings that allow for effective molecular prediction solely from WSIs during inference.

Result: Extensive evaluation across 49 oncology tasks with data from 11,257 cases demonstrates PathLUPI's superior performance, achieving AUC ≥ 0.80 in biomarker tasks and C-index ≥ 0.70 in survival predictions for major cancer types.

Conclusion: PathLUPI provides a novel approach for integrating molecular insights into routine pathology, improving predictive accuracy and offering a bridge between molecular analysis and clinical workflows.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

### [158] [Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19683)
*Xuesong Li,Dianye Huang,Yameng Zhang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) approach for improving the understanding and usability of ultrasound imaging for non-expert users, validated on neck scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of making ultrasound imaging more interpretable and accessible to non-expert users, particularly in point-of-care settings.

Method: The paper uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute scene graphs (SG) for ultrasound images and refines their representation via large language models (LLMs) to enable image explanations and scanning guidance.

Result: The approach was tested on ultrasound images of the neck from five volunteers, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing scanning guidance for missing anatomies and improving image interpretation for non-expert users.

Conclusion: The SG-based method shows promise in democratizing ultrasound usage by enhancing accessibility, interpretability, and usability for non-experts.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

### [159] [UltraAD: Fine-Grained Ultrasound Anomaly Classification via Few-Shot CLIP Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19694)
*Yue Zhou,Yuan Bi,Wenjuan Tong,Wei Wang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraAD is a vision-language model designed for anomaly detection in medical ultrasound images, offering improved generalization and precision in classification over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods lack fine-grained differentiation in anomalies and are negatively affected by domain gaps in ultrasound imaging caused by device and parameter variations.

Method: UltraAD employs a vision-language model using few-shot US examples. It integrates query visual prototypes with learnable text embeddings for refined localization and uses a memory bank of image samples and text descriptions for fine-grained classification. The text embeddings remain frozen during training.

Result: UltraAD demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained classification across three breast ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: UltraAD effectively addresses the challenges of fine-grained anomaly differentiation and domain gaps in ultrasound imaging, setting a new benchmark for medical imaging anomaly detection.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

*Junwei Zhou,Xueting Li,Lu Qi,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCo4D, a framework to generate 4D scenes (dynamic 3D over time) guided by text and optional images, ensuring coherent foreground motion and evolving background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 4D synthesis methods which struggle with multi-view consistency and immersive dynamic scenes.

Method: CoCo4D separates 4D scene synthesis into modeling dynamic foreground and evolving background, guided by a reference motion sequence, using video diffusion models and a novel progressive outpainting scheme.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CoCo4D outperforms or matches existing methods in 4D scene generation in terms of realism, coherence, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CoCo4D effectively generates immersive, multi-view consistent 4D scenes from text prompts and optional images, advancing the field by addressing key limitations of earlier approaches.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

### [161] [One Prototype Is Enough: Single-Prototype Activation for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19808)
*Yitao Peng,Lianghua He,Die Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoSolo is a novel neural network architecture for interpretable image classification that activates a single prototype for classification, simplifying explanations and achieving high performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cognitive complexity of multi-prototype-based explanations in image classification tasks by proposing a more interpretable and efficient solution.

Method: ProtoSolo introduces a single-prototype activation mechanism, feature-based comparison using feature maps instead of full-channel vectors, and a non-prototype projection learning strategy to maintain classification performance.

Result: ProtoSolo demonstrated superior classification performance and the lowest cognitive complexity of explanations on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ProtoSolo architecture streamlines the interpretability of image classification by using single-prototype activation while maintaining robustness and simplicity, making it a competitive state-of-the-art approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bind-Your-Avatar proposes addressing multi-talking-character video generation in shared spaces by introducing innovative solutions for audio-to-character control, 3D-mask embedding, and offering new datasets and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to handle unified conversation videos for multiple characters co-present in the same spatial environment due to challenges like audio-to-character correspondence and the lack of suitable datasets.

Method: The authors propose a framework featuring an embedding router for audio-to-character binding, 3D-mask embedding methods with geometrically guided losses and mask refinement, and introduce a new multi-character video dataset.

Result: Experiments showcase significant improvements in generating multi-character conversations when compared to state-of-the-art approaches, backed by a newly provided dataset and baseline benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of talking head generation by addressing multi-character interactions in shared scenes, proposing novel methods and releasing useful datasets, leading to superior performance in multi-character video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of high-resolution video generation by combining semantic content creation and cascaded video super-resolution. They propose specific methods and strategies to align and optimize the system, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently produce high-resolution video outputs using latent diffusion models, which better meet rising user expectations while overcoming computational limitations of low-resolution latent generation.

Method: The authors introduce two degradation strategies to generate better training pairs, analyze VSR model design with timestep sampling and noise augmentation, and propose efficient architectural innovations like interleaving temporal units and sparse attention.

Result: Experiments show the framework's superiority over existing systems, offering efficient training and inference. Ablation studies validate the impact of each design choice.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust baseline for cascaded video super-resolution, providing insights and principles for future improvements in efficient video synthesis systems.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

*Moayed Haji-Ali,Willi Menapace,Ivan Skorokhodov,Arpit Sahni,Sergey Tulyakov,Vicente Ordonez,Aliaksandr Siarohin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), a simplified framework for progressive generation in visual media that outperforms previous approaches and requires minimal architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the generation of high-dimensional visual modalities compared to complex multi-stage architectures.

Method: DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation, such as Laplacian pyramids, to achieve progressive generation.

Result: DFM demonstrates significant improvements in visual quality, boosting FDD scores by 35.2% on Imagenet-1k 512px compared to the base architecture and faster convergence in fine-tuning large models.

Conclusion: DFM offers architectural simplicity, superior visual results, and compatibility with existing pipelines, making it an effective framework for progressive generation.

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenHSI, a training-free method to generate long human-scene interaction videos leveraging a three-stage process: script writing, pre-visualization, and animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating long, movie-like videos with realistic human-object interactions, identity preservation, and without requiring costly training.

Method: The method subdivides the task into three stages: (1) Script writing to define atomic tasks, (2) Pre-visualization to generate 3D keyframes, and (3) Animation using off-the-shelf video diffusion models.

Result: The proposed method generates long videos with consistent camera poses, preserves character identity, and showcases plausible human-scene interactions from a single image scene.

Conclusion: GenHSI demonstrates the feasibility of training-free, consistent long video generation with detailed human-scene interactions by integrating 3D rendering and video diffusion models.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction by reframing it as a 2D image quality assessment task, using a cross-referencing framework for guide.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are complex, tailored to specific 3D representations, and computationally expensive.

Method: Propose a cross-referencing IQA framework trained to predict SSIM in a multi-view setup for guiding view selection, bypassing ground-truth limitations.

Result: Achieve significant performance improvements, operate agnostically to 3D representations, and run 14-33x faster compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies view selection by leveraging a 2D IQA framework while outperforming and speeding up traditional methods, demonstrating scalability and versatility.

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimaX is a feed-forward framework that adapts video diffusion model motion priors to create scalable and controllable 3D skeleton-based animations across diverse meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D motion synthesis methods face challenges like fixed skeletal topologies and high-dimensional optimization costs, limiting their scalability and generalization.

Method: AnimaX uses multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps for motion representation, combining video-pose diffusion with template renderings and motion prompts. It employs shared positional encodings for alignment and triangulates pose sequences into 3D positions, followed by inverse kinematics for mesh animation.

Result: Trained on a new dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency on VBench.

Conclusion: AnimaX provides a scalable, category-agnostic solution for creating high-quality 3D animations by bridging video motion priors with skeleton-based animation control systems.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Radial Attention, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces computational costs in video diffusion models by exploiting spatiotemporal energy decay patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high computational costs associated with video diffusion models, particularly for training and generating long videos, by leveraging observed spatiotemporal energy decay in attention mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces Radial Attention, an $O(n \log n)$ sparse attention mechanism that decreases compute density exponentially with distance, coupled with fine-tuning via LoRA to extend pre-trained models for generating longer videos efficiently.

Result: Radial Attention achieved a 1.9x speedup in video quality generation, supported videos up to 4x longer, reduced training costs by up to 4.4x, and accelerated inference by up to 3.7x compared to dense attention methods.

Conclusion: Radial Attention offers a computationally efficient and scalable alternative to dense attention in video diffusion models, enabling improvements in speed, resource consumption, and extended video lengths while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

*Peng Shu,Junhao Chen,Zhengliang Liu,Huaqin Zhao,Xinliang Li,Tianming Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper surveys HPC usage in U.S. universities, highlights the performance gap compared to national and industrial infrastructures, and suggests strategies to improve access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for HPC is growing due to advancements in AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies. Universities lack the resources to keep pace with national and industrial HPC systems, creating disparities.

Method: The paper benchmarks HPC capabilities at over 50 U.S. research universities against DOE systems and industrial AI platforms. It examines factors like compute capacity, architecture, governance, and energy efficiency.

Result: University HPC systems have lower growth rates (~18% CAGR) than national (~43%) and industrial (~78%) systems, with a widening GPU-centric capability gap. Emerging methods like federated computing and decentralized learning are suggested.

Conclusion: Academic leaders and stakeholders are advised to adopt federated models, GPU utilization strategies, and new AI paradigms to democratize access, ensuring HPC sustainability and equity for research advancement.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

### [171] [Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197)
*Calum Buchanan,Puck Rombach,James Bagrow,Hamid R. Ossareh*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalized algorithm to optimize unit ball graphs for both reliability and area coverage by strategically adding or moving vertices, addressing challenges such as agent failure in swarm networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to enhance the reliability and area coverage of unit ball graphs, which are used to model spatial networks like communication networks in autonomous swarms. This is crucial due to potential failures in agents or communication links.

Method: The authors generalize their earlier cubic-time complexity algorithm for optimizing unit ball graphs, allowing repositioning or addition of vertices for maximizing connectivity reliability while ensuring vertices are evenly distributed for area coverage.

Result: The proposed approach provides a method to improve the reliability and spatial distribution in unit ball graphs by determining optimal vertex placement. The results are compared to a method using a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully balances reliability and area coverage in unit ball graphs, making it useful for designing robust and evenly distributed swarm networks.

Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in
Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$.
These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks,
including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such
an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly
reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered
inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball
graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary
conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to
determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single
vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an
efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a
location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in
many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often
contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to
improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a
location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the
reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within
some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high
reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a
modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.

*Guy Goren,Andrew Hariri,Timothy D. R. Hartley,Ravi Kappiyoor,Alexander Spiegelman,David Zmick*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Shelby is a decentralized storage protocol designed to handle intensive Web3 applications by delivering Web2-grade performance. It addresses shortcomings in throughput, latency, cost, and availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized storage protocols are inadequate for high-demand applications such as video streaming and AI training, forcing Web3 to rely on centralized solutions.

Method: Shelby employs a Web2-inspired architecture: separation of control and data planes, erasure coding, a dedicated backbone connecting nodes, paid reads, and a new auditing protocol with strong cryptoeconomic guarantees.

Result: Shelby achieves reliable and fast access to large-scale data while maintaining decentralization, enabling its use for production-scale Web3 applications.

Conclusion: The Shelby protocol successfully bridges the gap between the performance needs of Web3 applications and decentralized storage paradigms, bringing decentralization and high efficiency together.

Abstract: Existing decentralized storage protocols fall short of the service required
by real-world applications. Their throughput, latency, cost-effectiveness, and
availability are insufficient for demanding workloads such as video streaming,
large-scale data analytics, or AI training. As a result, Web3 data-intensive
applications are predominantly dependent on centralized infrastructure.
  Shelby is a high-performance decentralized storage protocol designed to meet
demanding needs. It achieves fast, reliable access to large volumes of data
while preserving decentralization guarantees. The architecture reflects lessons
from Web2 systems: it separates control and data planes, uses erasure coding
with low replication overhead and minimal repair bandwidth, and operates over a
dedicated backbone connecting RPC and storage nodes. Reads are paid, which
incentivizes good performance. Shelby also introduces a novel auditing protocol
that provides strong cryptoeconomic guarantees without compromising
performance, a common limitation of other decentralized solutions. The result
is a decentralized system that brings Web2-grade performance to
production-scale, read-intensive Web3 applications.

*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Lightning Network as an off-chain monetary system, revealing potential systemic and economic challenges through modeling and game-theoretic proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to understand the structural differences and economic implications of the Lightning Network compared to Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model.

Method: Employing mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis to evaluate transaction demands, routing costs, operational dynamics, and systemic impacts of liquidity hubs.

Result: Indicated that Lightning Network hubs evolve into unregulated financial intermediaries, posing issues like rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility.

Conclusion: Lightning Network diverges significantly from Bitcoin's settlement model, acting as a shadowbank system with synthetic financial properties and lacking essential safeguards like reserve discipline and settlement guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary
system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We
demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise
superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing
costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic
proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite
off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs
exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent
extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that
channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach
hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not
merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with
shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or
enforceable settlement guarantees.

### [174] [A Heuristic Algorithm for Shortest Path Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19349)
*Huashan Yu,Xiaolin Wang,Yingwei Luo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel parallel algorithm for the Single-Source Shortest Path problem and achieves significant speedup compared to state-of-the-art implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parallel algorithms for SSSP face challenges in being both efficient and practical. Developing a method that addresses these challenges is crucial for graph processing.

Method: Introduces a new shortest path search method allowing parallel path extensions with minimal redundancy. Two heuristics, dynamic-stepping and traversal-optimization, are applied to reduce inefficiencies and improve balance.

Result: The proposed algorithm was tested on 73 graphs and achieved speedups of 2.5x to 5.83x over top existing implementations (excluding the Road graph).

Conclusion: The novel method and heuristics provide an effective solution for parallel SSSP, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical viability.

Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is well-known for the
challenges in developing fast, practical, and work-efficient parallel
algorithms. This work introduces a novel shortest path search method. It allows
paths with different lengths to be extended in parallel at the cost of almost
negligible repeated relaxations. A dynamic-stepping heuristic is proposed for
the method to efficiently reduce the extended paths and the synchronizations. A
traversal-optimization heuristic is proposed to improve the method by
efficiently reducing the created paths and alleviating the load imbalance.
Based on the method, the two heuristics are used to develop a practical SSSP
algorithm, which tactfully reduces workload and overhead. The heuristics and
the algorithm were evaluated on 73 real-world and synthetic graphs. The
algorithm was also compared with five state-of-the-art SSSP implementations. On
each GAP benchmark suite graph except Road, its speedup to the best achieved by
these five implementations is 2.5x to 5.83x.

*Prabhat Kumar Chand,Manish Kumar,Anisur Rahaman Molla*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents efficient algorithms for BFS and MST tree construction in agent-based networks, improving upon memory and time requirements in distributed computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address classical problems like BFS and MST in distributed computing, but in the context of agent-based networks (where agents move and compute).

Method: A deterministic algorithm is proposed, achieving efficient BFS and MST tree constructions without knowledge of graph parameters, using limited memory ($O(\log n)$ bits per agent). Through this, the paper solves leader election and determines the root for tree construction.

Result: The BFS tree is constructed in $O(\min(D\Delta, m\log n) + n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, a leader is elected, and MST is built in $O(n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, significantly improving time and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The work achieves nearly linear-time leader election and MST construction with improved efficiency, providing valuable contributions to agent-based distributed network optimization.

Abstract: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree constructions
are classical problems in distributed computing, traditionally studied in the
message-passing model, where static nodes communicate via messages. This paper
investigates MST and BFS tree construction in an agent-based network, where
mobile agents explore a graph and compute. Each node hosts one agent, and
communication occurs when agents meet at a node. We consider $n$ agents
initially dispersed (one per node) in an anonymous, arbitrary $n$-node,
$m$-edge graph $G$. The goal is to construct the BFS and MST trees from this
configuration such that each tree edge is known to at least one of its
endpoints, while minimizing time and memory per agent. We work in a synchronous
model and assume agents have no prior knowledge of any graph parameters such as
$n$, $m$, $D$, $\Delta$ (graph diameter and maximum degree). Prior work solves
BFS in $O(D\Delta)$ rounds with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent, assuming the root
is known. We give a deterministic algorithm that constructs the BFS tree in
$O(\min(D\Delta, m\log n) + n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds using $O(\log
n)$ bits per agent without root knowledge. To determine the root, we solve
leader election and MST construction. We elect a leader and construct the MST
in $O(n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent.
Prior MST algorithms require $O(m + n\log n)$ rounds and $\max(\Delta, \log n)
\log n$ bits. Our results significantly improve memory efficiency and time,
achieving nearly linear-time leader election and MST. Agents are assumed to
know $\lambda$, the maximum identifier, bounded by a polynomial in $n$.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the computational and data management challenges in large-scale scientific collaborations and proposes an introspective model to evaluate decision-making alternatives for job allocation and data placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inefficiencies in managing data placement and payload allocation decisions within large scientific collaborations.

Method: Analyzed real-world data from the PanDA workflow system, extracted key performance indicators, and developed a generative AI model to simulate payload time series.

Result: Identified critical indicators influencing computational efficiency and proposed a generative model incorporating hidden features affecting queuing times and remote data access.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the importance of tools for introspective modeling to refine AI-driven and heuristic approaches, enabling better optimization of resources in scientific experiments.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

*Shuhang Xu,Yunfei Gu,Linhui Liu,Chentao Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Probability-Sensitive Wear Leveling (PS-WL) optimizes flash SSD arrays by balancing failure risk rather than wear, reducing overhead and lowering failure risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling SSD arrays to accommodate growing data demands poses reliability risks under traditional wear-leveling techniques.

Method: PS-WL introduces an effective lifetime model based on realistic failure probabilities, guided by a PID controller with a conservative zone to manage wear leveling.

Result: Simulations show PS-WL significantly reduces performance overhead and consistently lowers aggregated array failure risk across diverse configurations.

Conclusion: PS-WL enhances storage system scalability and reliability by directly optimizing for failure risk rather than wear distribution.

Abstract: As flash-based Solid State Drive (SSD) arrays become essential to modern data
centers, scaling these arrays to meet explosive data growth is a frequent and
critical operation. However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm
applied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the
non-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially
pushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address
this critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear
Leveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear
to directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an "effective
lifetime" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately
assess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling
operation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by
restricting warm data migration. Comprehensive simulations validate the
superiority of PS-WL over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate
that our approach significantly reduces performance overhead while, most
critically, consistently and effectively lowering the aggregated array failure
risk across diverse system configurations and workloads. This proves that by
directly optimizing for reliability, PS-WL builds a scalable storage system
that is, by design, fundamentally safer, more efficient, and more stable.

TL;DR: Proposes HI-SQL, a method utilizing historical query logs for efficient and accurate Text-to-SQL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and accurate Text-to-SQL queries for complex database operations using large language models, addressing current issues like high costs, latency, and error propagation.

Method: Introduces a hint generation mechanism leveraging historical query logs to create contextual hints for SQL generation, seamlessly integrating them into the generation process.

Result: Demonstrated improved query accuracy, reduced computational costs, and better efficiency in experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: HI-SQL offers a robust and practical solution to enhance Text-to-SQL systems, particularly for complex queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: Score-based generative models can effectively be trained via local learning rules to achieve sampling tasks in both mathematical distributions and complex datasets like MNIST.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

*Shuang Ao,Yi Dong,Jinwei Hu,Sarvapali Ramchurn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPLoRA, a pruning-based technique that enhances the safety alignment of Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) by selectively removing LoRA layers that compromise safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs using methods like LoRA enhances adaptability but often compromises safety, rendering models more vulnerable to harmful outputs. Safeguarding LLMs without significantly sacrificing utility has proven to be a complex challenge.

Method: The authors introduce SPLoRA, a pruning-based approach, guided by Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a novel similarity metric designed to detect safety misalignment in models fine-tuned with LoRA layers. SPLoRA selectively prunes LoRA layers that lead to safety vulnerabilities.

Result: SPLoRA demonstrated superior performance in experiments, significantly improving safety alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. It preserved or even enhanced model performance and reliability, while also reducing inference overhead.

Conclusion: SPLoRA offers a scalable and efficient method for improving the safety alignment of fine-tuned LLMs without compromising performance, making it a promising solution for deploying safer LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a novel approach to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) by introducing sequential expert communication within individual layers for improved token routing and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE architectures keep experts independent and parallel, limiting their ability to dynamically specialize and communicate. This paper seeks to address these limitations by proposing an architectural enhancement for richer expert representation and improved performance.

Method: The CoE introduces a sequential expert communication mechanism. Within each layer, tokens iteratively pass through a chain of experts, dynamically selecting different experts at each iteration using a dedicated routing system. This iterative process enables flexible and adaptive combinations of experts.

Result: Compared to standard MoE models, CoE significantly improves performance, such as reducing validation loss on math reasoning tasks from 1.20 to 1.12. Additionally, it supports scaling through increased depth (expert iterations), matching performance at reduced memory usage by 17.6-42%.

Conclusion: CoE enriches the expressive power of MoE models by introducing iterative expert communication and dynamic routing. This enables a scalable and memory-efficient model architecture with enhanced token routing and expert specialization capabilities.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

*Maoyuan Li,Sihong Li,Guancheng Shen,Yun Zhang,Huamin Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mixed feature attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model is proposed for precise online prediction of product weight in injection molding, achieving performance improvements over other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges of untimely detection and monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies.

Method: The study integrates mechanism-based and data-driven analyses to decouple time-series and non-time-series data, embedding a self-attention mechanism for feature calibration.

Result: The MFA-ANN model outperforms conventional approaches by achieving lower RMSE and higher accuracy. Ablation studies validate the contributions of mixed feature modeling and attention mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed MFA-ANN model provides an efficient and reliable solution for intelligent quality control in injection molding processes.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents HOLA, an optimization framework enabling efficient LLM deployment on edge devices by combining techniques like Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), adaptive retrieval (AdaComp-RAG), and structured pruning and quantization (LoBi), achieving better performance with reduced latency and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying LLMs on edge devices, where high compute and memory demands limit their real-time application, especially in areas such as healthcare, education, and embedded systems.

Method: The authors propose HOLA, combining Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference, adaptive retrieval complexity with AdaComp-RAG, and blending structured pruning and quantization techniques (LoBi).

Result: HOLA achieves measurable improvements like 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, along with reduced latency and memory usage, especially on devices like Jetson Nano.

Conclusion: HOLA is both scalable and production-ready, offering a comprehensive solution to optimize LLMs for edge deployment without sacrificing accuracy or speed.

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

*Hanshuo Wu,Xudong Jian,Christos Lataniotis,Cyprien Hoelzl,Eleni Chatzi,Yves Reuland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep-learning approach using SHM sensor networks for automated traffic monitoring on bridges, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to vision-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional and CV-based traffic monitoring methods (privacy concerns, lighting issues, and flexibility) and provide a more reliable approach for assessing the remaining service life of deteriorating bridges.

Method: The method involves integrating CV-assisted dataset generation with graph neural networks (GNNs) for supervised training and inference to monitor traffic loads using SHM sensor networks.

Result: The proposed framework achieves classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles in a real-world application.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates it's possible to use SHM sensor networks autonomously to monitor traffic with accuracy comparable to CV-based systems, addressing deployment, lighting, and privacy issues.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

*Shashank Yadav,Vignesh Subbian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in applying common interpretability algorithms for deep learning to dynamic prediction tasks, proposing learnable mask-based frameworks as an alternative for critical care applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve interpretability in dynamic prediction tasks within critical care, as existing methods struggle with time-varying target dependencies and temporal smoothness.

Method: The paper proposes the use of learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks, which incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to better capture feature importance in evolving patient trajectories.

Result: The learnable mask-based interpretability approaches provide more reliable and consistent interpretations in dynamic timeseries prediction tasks compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Learnable mask-based frameworks are recommended as a superior alternative for interpretability in critical care, offering enhanced reliability and consistency in time-series predictions.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

*Nitish Nagesh,Ziyu Wang,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic data generation method that improves causal fairness in health datasets using LLM-based techniques, reducing bias while ensuring data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for synthetic data generation in health lack focus on causal fairness, which is critical for equitable outcomes in sensitive attributes.

Method: The authors propose a novel LLM-augmented method using real-world tabular health data to generate data with enhanced causal fairness.

Result: The generated data preserves causal fairness within 10% of real data and reduces bias on sensitive attributes by 70% compared to real data.

Conclusion: The approach provides access to fair synthetic health data, promoting equity in healthcare research and delivery.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

### [189] [GradualDiff-Fed: A Federated Learning Specialized Framework for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19164)
*Amir Faiyaz,Tara Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GradualDiff-Fed, a decentralized framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using federated learning (FL), which reduces communication costs by transmitting only model weight differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs has created a need for domain-specific fine-tuning in decentralized and privacy-sensitive environments, where raw data cannot be shared.

Method: The GradualDiff-Fed framework optimizes federated learning for LLMs by reducing communication overhead, sending only the incremental differences in model weights between training rounds rather than the entire model.

Result: GradualDiff-Fed achieves comparable performance to centralized training while significantly lowering communication demands in distributed settings.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed presents a scalable and efficient way to fine-tune LLMs in privacy-preserving FL setups, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates correlations between human preferences and existing metrics for generated music using a large-scale study, ranking models by human preference and providing a dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating generated music quality objectively and incorporating human preferences into metrics is challenging.

Method: Generated 6k songs using 12 models; conducted 15k pairwise comparisons with 2.5k human participants.

Result: Correlated human preferences with commonly used metrics and ranked music-generation models based on human evaluation.

Conclusion: This study provides a pioneering ranking system and open dataset to improve subjective metric evaluation in music generation research.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

*Fanny Lehmann,Firat Ozdemir,Benedikt Soja,Torsten Hoefler,Siddhartha Mishra,Sebastian Schemm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Aurora foundation model for predicting new hydrological variables, introducing a shallow decoder approach as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how foundation models, particularly Aurora, can be extended to predict new hydrological variables without retraining the full model.

Method: Used shallow decoders trained on the latent representations of the pretrained model as an alternative to full fine-tuning.

Result: The decoder approach reduced training time by 50% and memory usage by 35%, achieving strong accuracy while preserving autoregressive stability.

Conclusion: Foundation models in Earth sciences can be efficiently applied to new variables using lightweight, resource-friendly methods, broadening accessibility and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

*Andreas Bjerregaard,Søren Hauberg,Anders Krogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Riemannian generative decoder" to simplify manifold-valued generative modeling by eliminating the encoder and optimizing with a Riemannian optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Riemannian representation learning methods rely on approximating densities on manifolds, which involves complex objectives that can hinder model performance.

Method: The proposed Riemannian generative decoder trains a decoder network while using a Riemannian optimizer to find maximum likelihood latents, discarding the encoder entirely.

Result: The approach is validated on three case studies, demonstrating that the learned representations align with the prescribed geometry and effectively capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structures.

Conclusion: The method simplifies manifold constraints, is compatible with existing architectures, and provides interpretable, data-aligned latent spaces, making it a versatile tool for Riemannian representation learning.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

*Conor Snedeker,Xinyu Zhou,Raef Bassily*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes algorithms for federated learning with user-level differential privacy to address personalization for heterogeneous user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively and privately personalize models for users with statistically heterogeneous data using a shared low-dimensional representation.

Method: Design a private federated learning algorithm based on FedRep by incorporating differential privacy. Utilize the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for dimensionality reduction in the binary classification setting.

Result: Proved improved privacy utility guarantees compared to prior work and achieved dimension-independent accuracy in binary classification.

Conclusion: The approach achieves efficient and private personalization in federated learning under broader data distribution assumptions.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

*Daan Huybrechs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how neural networks can function as algorithms by explicitly constructing them, like a sorting algorithm, to assess their expressivity and capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical and functional capabilities of neural networks, particularly their ability to represent and execute algorithmic processes, instead of just viewing them as data-trained models.

Method: The authors construct neural networks explicitly, instead of training them, and analyze their functioning as algorithms. They focus on a sorting algorithm to showcase the approach and evaluate its performance and properties.

Result: They find that neural networks constructed as algorithms are recursive, parallel, and constrained by their continuity and depth. They also observe that deep networks offer better capabilities than shallow ones.

Conclusion: Constructing neural networks as algorithms provides insights into their expressivity and functional limitations, with depth playing a critical role in their efficacy.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that transformers can precisely implement Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering and extend this to produce novel variants of clustering algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether modern transformer architectures, central to breakthroughs in AI, are capable of learning and executing precise algorithmic procedures like $k$-means clustering.

Method: The authors theoretically prove the feasibility of a transformer model implementing Lloyd’s $k$-means algorithm and then validate it by building such a transformer numerically. They further modify this architecture to create novel clustering variants.

Result: Their transformer model is shown to exactly match Lloyd’s algorithm in functionality. Additionally, introducing modifications such as layer normalization produces interpretable variants of $k$-means clustering.

Conclusion: Transformers can directly implement and extend precise algorithms, showcasing their adaptability and providing new avenues for neural algorithm design.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

*Barry Wang,Avi Schwarzschild,Alexander Robey,Ali Payani,Charles Fleming,Mingjie Sun,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Command-V, a method enabling large language models (LLMs) to adopt new behaviors without requiring extensive finetuning, distillation, or original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning LLMs to adapt to new behaviors is computationally expensive and architecture-specific. There is a need for efficient transfer methods that minimize resource consumption and bypass the constraints of traditional finetuning.

Method: Command-V leverages a backpropagation-free approach by profiling activations on a prompt set, deriving linear converters between the layers of donor and recipient models, and transferring residual activation adapters without original training datasets.

Result: Command-V demonstrates competitive or superior performance relative to direct finetuning in three applications: safety enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic chain-of-thought reasoning, with substantially lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and efficient alternative to finetuning, facilitating flexibility and adaptability across different LLM architectures while significantly reducing resource requirements.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

### [197] [Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143)
*Paul C. Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to analyze large language models' reasoning traces at the sentence level to enhance interpretability. It identifies "thought anchors" that significantly influence reasoning and provides an open-source tool for visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the interpretability challenges of large language models' long-form, chain-of-thought reasoning where token dependencies are difficult to decompose.

Method: Three complementary attribution methods are introduced: (1) a black-box counterfactual importance measure, (2) a white-box aggregation of attention patterns identifying key "broadcasting" sentences, and (3) a causal attribution method examining the impact of suppressing sentence attention.

Result: The methods reveal "thought anchors," significant reasoning steps that influence subsequent reasoning disproportionately. These anchors are mostly planning or backtracking sentences.

Conclusion: The consistency across the proposed methods demonstrates the viability of sentence-level analysis for understanding the reasoning of language models. The study also provides tools to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Puneesh Deora,Bhavya Vasudeva,Tina Behnia,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how transformer models perform in-context learning (ICL) with tasks of varying complexities. It shows that transformers adopt a Bayesian Occam's razor principle to favor simpler explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle tasks spanning different complexity levels and whether they prioritize simpler explanations when multiple hypotheses are possible.

Method: The study uses testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression to analyze transformers' ability to infer task complexity and parameters. It also includes experiments on GPT-4 using Boolean-function tasks.

Result: Transformers both identify the correct task complexity and infer parameters accurately, favoring simpler explanations even when data allows multiple interpretations.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that transformers utilize an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor to balance model fit against complexity, and this inductive bias is likely inherent to transformers trained on diverse tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

### [199] [Distilling Tool Knowledge into Language Models via Back-Translated Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19171)
*Xingyue Huang,Xianglong Hu,Zifeng Ding,Yuan He,Rishabh,Waleed Alzarooni,Ziyu Ye,Wendong Fan,Bailan He,Haige Bo,Changran Hu,Guohao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to teach large language models (LLMs) math reasoning by distilling tool knowledge into them using natural language, eliminating the need for tool access during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with exact computation and multi-step algebra. Current tool-integrated reasoning solutions pose scalability issues. The goal is to internalize tool knowledge within LLMs to improve performance without tool dependencies.

Method: The approach involves creating a Solver Agent that uses tools for reasoning, then translating this into natural language reasoning traces using Translator and Rephrase Agents. Synthesized traces are used to fine-tune open-source models.

Result: Empirical results demonstrated that fine-tuning a small model on synthesized traces improved performance on high-level math benchmarks without requiring external tool access during inference.

Conclusion: Tool knowledge and structured reasoning can be distilled into LLMs through natural language, improving their math reasoning abilities efficiently and scalably.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

### [200] [Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19540)
*Lennart Schneider,Bernd Bischl,Matthias Feurer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies 'overtuning' in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), where excessive optimization of validation error can lead to worse model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the phenomenon of overtuning in HPO, which has been largely overlooked despite its impact on model generalization.

Method: The authors formally define overtuning, differentiate it from related concepts, and conduct a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to evaluate its prevalence, severity, and contributing factors.

Result: Overtuning is found to be more common than assumed, generally mild but sometimes severe, affecting about 10% of cases by selecting suboptimal configurations. Various factors like dataset size and resampling strategy influence overtuning.

Conclusion: Raising awareness of overtuning is necessary, especially for small datasets, and further research into mitigation strategies is essential.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores high-precision training strategies for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) tailored to unbounded domains, aiming to model singularity formations in PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a precise computational framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks to address open challenges in understanding singularities in PDEs for theoretical and practical benefits.

Method: They propose a modularized strategy, focusing on neural network architecture, sampling techniques, and optimization schemes, while leveraging rigorous computer-assisted proofs.

Result: For the 1D Burgers equation, their approach achieved high-precision solutions, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, they attained solutions with losses significantly lower than recent benchmarks.

Conclusion: Their findings demonstrate the potential of PINNs as a powerful tool for studying singularities in PDEs and offer pathways to refine precision for complex higher-dimensional problems.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend kernel theory beyond Euclidean spaces, enabling the study and application of kernels in Riemannian symmetric spaces for manifold-valued data.

Method: The authors develop fundamental tools to investigate kernel universality properties in Riemannian symmetric spaces and apply these tools to analyze specific positive definite kernels.

Result: The study demonstrates the universality of multiple positive definite kernels on Riemannian symmetric spaces.

Conclusion: The findings provide a theoretical foundation for using these universal kernels in machine learning applications involving non-Euclidean or manifold-valued data.

Abstract: The universality properties of kernels characterize the class of functions
that can be approximated in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space and
are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the
universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive
definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving
manifold-valued data.

### [203] [Geometric-Aware Variational Inference: Robust and Adaptive Regularization with Directional Weight Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19726)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concentration-Adapted Perturbations (CAP), using von Mises-Fisher distributions for uncertainty modeling in neural networks, improving model calibration significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for uncertainty quantification in neural networks often fail to match the network's geometry due to simplistic isotropic Gaussian weight-space approximations.

Method: The authors propose the CAP framework, leveraging von Mises-Fisher distributions on the hypersphere to model weight uncertainties and using a closed-form KL divergence regularizer to optimize uncertainty levels per layer.

Result: CAP dramatically enhances calibration performance in neural networks, reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6 times on CIFAR-10 experiments.

Conclusion: CAP offers a practical and theoretically sound solution for uncertainty quantification, integrating effectively with existing neural network architectures and yielding interpretable uncertainty profiles.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

*Renzi Meng,Heyi Wang,Yumeng Sun,Qiyuan Wu,Lian Lian,Renhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated contrastive learning method for anomaly detection in distributed systems, addressing data privacy, heterogeneity, and pattern recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitations of centralized approaches in anomaly detection, especially regarding data privacy, heterogeneity among nodes, and effective pattern recognition for distributed systems.

Method: The method combines federated learning's collaborative modeling with contrastive learning's feature discrimination. Local nodes create embeddings and use positive and negative sample pairs to enhance discriminative feature spaces, while a global model is optimized using federated aggregation. Training utilizes an encoder for high-dimensional representations and loss functions for fine-grained anomaly detection.

Result: The proposed method exhibits strong detection accuracy, better performance across metrics compared to existing approaches, and adaptability in challenging distributed environments.

Conclusion: The method achieves an effective balance between privacy preservation and detection performance, offering a practical solution for intelligent security in distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

*Yihong Luo,Shuchen Xue,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a lightweight method for integrating new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without retraining the model, achieving state-of-the-art controllable generation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the versatility and computational efficiency of high-quality content generation in AI by addressing challenges in adapting pre-trained one-step generators to new control conditions.

Method: Proposes Noise Consistency Training (NCT) that leverages an adapter module and noise consistency loss to guide pre-trained one-step generators towards new control signals without retraining or requiring the original training data.

Result: NCT achieves superior controllable generation in a single forward pass, outperforms multi-step and distillation-based methods, and excels in both quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NCT is a modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable solution for improving control in pre-trained one-step generators, demonstrating significant advancements in controllable high-quality content generation.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

### [206] [Inference-Time Reward Hacking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19248)
*Hadi Khalaf,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Alex Oesterling,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio du Pin Calmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of reward hacking during inference-time alignment in LLMs and introduces new methods and algorithms (e.g., BoP, HedgeTune) to mitigate these effects efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the problem of reward hacking, where the optimization of imperfect reward models leads to undesired alignment results and reduced LLM performance.

Method: The paper explores inference-time mechanisms like BoN and SBoN, introduces BoP as a near-optimal reward-KL divergence policy, and develops HedgeTune to optimize inference-time parameters.

Result: The authors show that reward hacking arises inherently in certain inference-time methods and demonstrate that hedging can efficiently counter this phenomenon while maintaining performance with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Hedging is an effective strategy to mitigate reward hacking and optimize the tradeoff between reward distortion and computational efficiency in LLM inference contexts.

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces cross-regularization, a novel gradient-based method for dynamically tuning regularization parameters during training, optimizing model complexity and reducing manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of manually tuning regularization in machine learning models, which often requires balancing model complexity to avoid overfitting.

Method: The approach splits parameter optimization by leveraging training data for feature learning and validation data for adjusting complexity controls, using validation gradients during training.

Result: The method demonstrates unexpected noise tolerance, organically discovers architecture-specific regularization during training, and integrates with data augmentation and uncertainty calibration while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Cross-regularization effectively resolves complexity tradeoffs, enhancing model regularization dynamically during training with single-run efficiency and broad applicability.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

*Shili Wu,Yizhao Jin,Puhua Niu,Aniruddha Datta,Sean B. Andersson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve the robustness of Behavior Cloning policies using Lipschitz regularization to handle observation disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior Cloning policies are vulnerable to perceptual errors or adversarial disturbances during deployment, leading to sub-optimal agent actions.

Method: A global Lipschitz regularization is applied to the policy network, constructing a Lipschitz neural network to ensure robustness against bounded norm perturbations.

Result: The approach provides a robustness certificate for the policy and is empirically tested across Gymnasium environments, demonstrating efficacy.

Conclusion: Lipschitz regularization offers a practical solution to enhance the robustness of Behavior Cloning policies, ensuring better performance under observation errors.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification, focusing on minority class underperformance and sensitivity to structural noise, by proposing Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) and Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR), achieving improved generalization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based classification often struggles in OOD scenarios, specifically with minority class imbalance and structural noise, leading to performance degradation.

Method: The paper introduces Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) to boost minority class robustness and Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) to assign dynamic sample weights for noise mitigation.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show notable improvements in Graph OOD classification accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies effectively address structural noise and class imbalance challenges, enhancing robustness and accuracy in Graph OOD classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces BADGNN, a framework to address temporal continuity issues in dynamic graph neural networks caused by large batch training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks often face temporal modeling challenges due to event sequence disruptions from large batch training.

Method: The framework includes Temporal Lipschitz Regularization and Adaptive Attention Adjustment to manage parameter search space and address attention distortions.

Result: BADGNN demonstrates strong performance, faster training, and support for larger batches compared to TGN across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: BADGNN mitigates training inefficiencies and maintains temporal continuity in dynamic graphs, enabling effective optimization and scalability.

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning-based method to efficiently and accurately solve the Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem in renewable power systems, crucial for online relay setting calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volatility in renewable power systems due to increased renewable energy penetration and inverter-based resources necessitates efficient methods for online relay setting calculations.

Method: The paper proposes a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) that uses a multi-layer representation of the power system (component parameters, topology, electrical distance, graph distance) to predict extreme operating conditions.

Result: The proposed PGNN outperformed existing methods in accuracy and computation time during validation on modified IEEE test systems.

Conclusion: The PGNN-based method is effective for addressing the EOCS problem and is well-suited for online application in renewable power systems with improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how depth and width in deep linear State-Space Models (SSMs) affect their expressiveness, finding that depth can improve representation under constrained parameter norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how depth and width influence the expressiveness of deep linear SSMs can provide theoretical insights and aid in optimizing their design for sequence modeling tasks.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical investigation supplemented by numerical experiments, proving equivalence between depth and width under unconstrained settings, and analyzing differences under parameter norm constraints.

Result: The study finds that deep SSMs are better at representing models with large parameter norms than shallow SSMs under constrained norm conditions. They also derive upper bounds on the minimal depth needed to represent shallow SSMs.

Conclusion: Depth is advantageous under constrained norm scenarios, enhancing the representational capacity of deep linear SSMs. The findings underscore the structural trade-offs in SSM design.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

TL;DR: Deep learning models for detecting False Data Injection Attacks in smart grids are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification and disruption. Introducing adversarial training improves robustness against such threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the increasing use of deep learning in smart grids for FDIA detection, the authors aim to address the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks, which could lead to misclassification and operational disruptions.

Method: The authors propose a novel adversarial attack framework utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method. They evaluate the robustness of various deep learning architectures under adversarial conditions and implement adversarial training as a defense mechanism.

Result: Experimental evaluation reveals that deep learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with some models experiencing a success rate of over 99.7%. Adversarial training significantly enhances model robustness while maintaining fault detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The study raises awareness about the security issues of DLS-based FDIA detection in smart grids and demonstrates adversarial training as an effective solution to improve system resilience against adversarial threats.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False

attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

*Vineet Punyamoorty,Aditya Malusare,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CroMoTEX, a framework using contrastive learning to enhance ECG diagnostics for cardiac pathologies by leveraging chest X-ray data during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern diagnostic methods aim to integrate multimodal data like ECGs and CXRs to improve early warning and scalable cardiac assessments.

Method: CroMoTEX uses supervised cross-modal contrastive learning to align ECG and CXR data for robust feature learning, with adaptive hard negative weighting to improve task relevance.

Result: CroMoTEX demonstrates strong performance on the MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets, achieving AUROCs of up to 78.31 for edema diagnosis.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances ECG-based diagnostics using CXR during training while maintaining scalability for real-world applications where CXRs are unavailable.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data using database narrative alignment and statistical modeling, improving data quality for prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data, which hinders accurate insights for prevention and policy development.

Method: A framework leveraging the BERT model and statistical tools like Probit Logit was used to analyze 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022) for AIM patterns.

Result: The study found 2,767 AIM incidents (24.03%) and identified specific crash characteristics and regions prone to mismatch, such as nighttime incidents and older drivers.

Conclusion: Targeted training programs and improved crash data management are necessary for more accurate reporting and effective evidence-based policymaking.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE), a self-supervised learning model aimed at better handling heterophilic graphs by reconstructing discrepancy information. It outperforms prior methods across several tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph auto-encoders falter on heterophilic graphs where connected nodes aren't similar because they focus only on neighborhood information, leading to indistinguishable node representations.

Method: The authors propose DGMAE, which preserves node discrepancies by reconstructing the discrepancy information between neighboring nodes during the masking process.

Result: DGMAE demonstrated superior performance on 17 benchmark datasets and outperformed state-of-the-art methods across tasks like node classification, node clustering, and graph classification.

Conclusion: DGMAE effectively addresses limitations in heterophilic graph representation learning by preserving discrepancy information, showing significant advancements in graph analytic tasks.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

*Shijian Zheng,Fangxiao Jin,Shuhai Zhang,Quan Xue,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS), an efficient method for electromagnetic structure design that reduces computational cost and outperforms baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The design of advanced antennas and materials faces challenges due to high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations, with current data-intensive methods struggling under real-world scale and budget constraints.

Method: The authors propose PQS, which uses a hierarchical quadtree-based representation for efficient search and introduces a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism to reduce dependence on highly accurate predictors.

Result: PQS achieves superior performance in two real-world tasks, significantly reducing evaluation costs by 75-85% and saving 20.27-38.80 days in the design cycle compared to generative methods.

Conclusion: PQS effectively overcomes the challenges of high-dimensional EMS design, offering a scalable solution that balances computational efficiency and design quality.

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique for Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to efficiently scale them to billion-parameter models without additional tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve complex partial differential equations (PDEs) with Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) in a computationally efficient manner, especially addressing the scaling issue that increases model parameters and tuning complexity.

Method: The authors propose $
ablaTransfer-FNO using a mathematically derived parameterization scheme based on the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework to transfer optimal hyperparameters from small to large FNOs.

Result: The method effectively reduces computational costs for hyperparameter tuning on large FNOs, while maintaining or improving model accuracy, as validated through experiments on various PDEs.

Conclusion: $
ablaTransfer-FNO offers a scalable and efficient solution for tuning large FNOs, potentially enabling their wider use in solving highly complex PDEs.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

*Yisak Park,Sunwoo Lee,Seungyul Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Focusing Influence Mechanism (FIM) to enhance cooperation in sparse-reward cooperative MARL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards in cooperative MARL limit exploration and coordinated attention among agents.

Method: FIM leverages identifying critical state dimensions (CoG), counterfactual intrinsic rewards, and eligibility-trace-based credit accumulation.

Result: Experiments show that FIM significantly improves cooperative performance in various MARL benchmarks.

Conclusion: FIM effectively facilitates robust cooperation among agents in sparse-reward environments.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

*Florian Peter Busch,Moritz Willig,Florian Guldan,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a tag-based approach to causal discovery, associating multiple tags with variables to improve causal direction determination between variables, showing an improvement over traditional type-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery relies on assigning a single type to each variable, which may not be robust or flexible. This paper explores an alternative leveraging multiple tags to refine the determination of causal relations.

Method: The proposed method first applies existing causal discovery techniques to direct some edges in a causal graph. Then, these directed edges inform the relationships between tags, which are used to determine undirected causal edges.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the tag-based approach enhances causal discovery outcomes and aligns closely with common knowledge, outperforming traditional type-based methods.

Conclusion: Assigning multiple tags per variable adds robustness and flexibility to causal discovery, improving the directionality determination in practical and diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

TL;DR: This paper addresses bias problems in estimating $Q$-values with a locally adaptive overestimation reduction method for distributional reinforcement learning (DRL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing bias in $Q$-value estimation is essential, as overestimation leads to slower convergence in $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods.

Method: The paper introduces a locally adaptive overestimation control mechanism built on top of existing DRL algorithms, requiring minimal additional implementation.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms the validity of the approach, and double $Q$-learning is used to show integration feasibility. Experimental results demonstrate performance improvements in various environments, including tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is simple, effective, and integrates easily into existing DRL algorithms, addressing overestimation adaptively and improving learning performance.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

TL;DR: This paper presents FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two scalable and efficient equivariant GNNs designed for large-scale geometric graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs struggle to process large geometric graphs efficiently and lose performance when graphs are sparsified.

Method: FastEGNN uses virtual nodes to approximate real-node graphs, employing distinct message passing and aggregation for these nodes, alongside minimizing MMD for global distributedness. DistEGNN extends this approach by distributing virtual nodes across devices, acting as bridges between subgraphs.

Result: FastEGNN and DistEGNN achieved superior efficiency and performance when tested on large-scale benchmarks, including a new Fluid113K dataset with 113,000 nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed models enable accurate and scalable equivariant GNNs, addressing both efficiency and performance issues in large-scale geometric graph learning.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Dora D. Liu,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework to expose the vulnerabilities of Machine Unlearning (MU) by recalling forgotten class memberships without access to original models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unexplored vulnerabilities in MU technology and the privacy risks from potential leaks of unlearned information, especially in scenarios where original models are inaccessible.

Method: The authors implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework using a teacher-student knowledge distillation approach, where unlearned models act as noisy labelers to train student models. This problem is then formulated as Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) to recover forgotten class memberships.

Result: Experiments using state-of-the-art MU methods and various real datasets show that the MRA strategy is highly effective in recovering forgotten class memberships, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities in current MU technologies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the privacy risks in MU systems and sets a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of future defenses against MU vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of performance degradation in deep learning models caused by noisy label data.

Method: Proposes the COLUR framework based on co-training architecture for robust unlearning and relearning of correct knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that COLUR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in model restoration.

Conclusion: COLUR offers an effective solution to mitigate label noise issues, restoring and refining deep learning models' performance.

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

*Paul Kahlmeyer,Markus Fischer,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses enhancing symbolic regression by reducing the variable count using substitution methods, validated with functional dependence tests, which improves performance of regression algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of symbolic regression algorithms, especially as the complexity of formulas increases with more variables and operators.

Method: The method involves searching the space of small substitutions for valid combinations of variables in symbolic expressions, using functional dependence tests to validate substitutions, and iteratively reducing dimensions.

Result: The proposed technique efficiently identifies valid substitutions and leads to significant performance improvements for state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Conclusion: Introducing variable substitution significantly reduces the complexity of symbolic regression problems, making algorithms more effective, and the method is compatible with existing algorithms.

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using symbolic regression to find Lie point symmetries of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), achieving results beyond current computer algebra systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving ODEs is critical but automated solutions are particularly hard for nonlinear systems. Existing CASs struggle to identify Lie point symmetries, a key step in simplifying ODEs.

Method: The authors adapt search-based symbolic regression techniques to identify generators of Lie point symmetries for ODEs.

Result: The proposed approach successfully discovers symmetries of ODEs that current CASs cannot solve.

Conclusion: Integrating symbolic regression enables enhanced discovery of Lie point symmetries, addressing limitations of traditional CASs in solving nonlinear ODEs.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

*QinZhe Wang,Zixuan Chen,Keke Huang,Xiu Su,Chunhua Yang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConCM for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, addressing knowledge conflicts and improving performance by leveraging feature-structure dual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL), particularly prototype deviation, structure fixity, and knowledge conflict, which hinder the adaptability and expressiveness of models.

Method: The proposed approach, Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching (ConCM), incorporates memory-aware prototype calibration to enhance feature consistency and dynamic structure matching to ensure cross-session structure alignment.

Result: The ConCM method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like mini-ImageNet and CUB200, with significant improvements of 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ConCM effectively mitigates knowledge conflict and enhances geometric and structural consistency, offering an optimized approach for FSCIL tasks and setting new performance benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

*Pengpeng Ouyang,Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Shuo Feng,Zhao Jin,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called FAF for multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting, achieving significant accuracy improvements over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods struggle with limited historical data, failing to leverage both generalized and specific features among tasks. The study aims to resolve this issue.

Method: FAF includes three components—GKM (for generalized knowledge extraction via meta-learning), TSM (to learn task-specific features), and RM (to dynamically select relevant features during testing).

Result: FAF outperforms various baselines across five datasets, with a notable 41.81% improvement over iTransformer on CO$_2$ emissions data.

Conclusion: FAF provides a robust and adaptive solution for personalized time series forecasting, especially in scenarios with insufficient historical data.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

*Santiago A. Cadena,Andrea Merlo,Emanuel Laude,Alexander Bauer,Atul Agrawal,Maria Pascu,Marija Savtchouk,Enrico Guiraud,Lukas Bonauer,Stuart Hudson,Markus Kaiser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors released an open dataset of quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations and provided benchmarks for optimization, aiming to facilitate broader community progress in stellarator design for fusion energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in stellarator design due to the lack of standardized optimization problems, datasets, and accessible benchmarks, especially for the promising QI stellarator configurations.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma shapes by sampling QI fields and optimizing plasma boundaries. They introduced benchmarks of varying complexity and provided evaluation scripts, reference code, and baseline solutions using traditional optimization techniques. They also demonstrated how trained models can efficiently generate new configurations without expensive simulations.

Result: The dataset includes diverse QI stellarator boundary shapes and their corresponding performance metrics, enabling optimization tasks and data-driven modeling. The benchmarks, reference codes, and baselines promote easier engagement in stellarator design.

Conclusion: The open dataset and accompanying tools aim to democratize stellarator optimization, accelerate machine learning applications in this domain, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration toward commercial viable fusion energy.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

### [232] [Training Flexible Models of Genetic Variant Effects from Functional Annotations using Accelerated Linear Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19598)
*Alan N. Amin,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores DeepWAS, a technique for utilizing modern linear algebra to predict genetic impacts with larger neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genetic models are limited by computational inefficiencies, restricting data usage and predictive accuracy.

Method: Utilized fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS, enabling larger neural network models trained via full likelihood approaches.

Result: Larger models under DeepWAS improve predictions and outperform traditional methods trained with summary statistics.

Conclusion: DeepWAS facilitates enhanced predictive modeling to better understand genetic impacts, aiding disease prediction and therapeutic targets.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

*Pantelis R. Vlachas,Konstantinos Vlachas,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHLieNet, a framework designed to address challenges in modeling dynamical systems with parametric variability by creating a unified model that generalizes across system parameterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamical systems are widely used for modeling and forecasting, but their behavior is highly sensitive to parameter variations, making it challenging to construct generalized models.

Method: The authors propose PHLieNet, a two-part framework that learns a global mapping from parameter space to a nonlinear embedding, and another mapping from this embedding to the weights of a forecasting dynamics network using a hypernetwork.

Result: PHLieNet demonstrates superior performance in extrapolating and interpolating parameter spaces and time dynamics on several test systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in short-term accuracy and capturing long-term dynamical features.

Conclusion: PHLieNet effectively enables smooth generalization across parameterized system behaviors and outperforms existing methods in modeling dynamical systems with parametric variability.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

### [234] [Scaling Up Unbiased Search-based Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19626)
*Paul Kahlmeyer,Joachim Giesen,Michael Habeck,Henrik Voigt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving symbolic regression by systematically searching small symbolic expressions, leading to higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard regression methods in finding interpretable and accurate symbolic expressions, which often rely on vast search spaces and implicit assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a systematic search approach within the space of small symbolic expressions that decompose into a few subexpressions to make the search more efficient and effective.

Result: The proposed systematic search method demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness against noise and outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques, particularly in recovering true underlying symbolic expressions on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Systematic search focusing on small symbolic expressions is a promising direction for achieving both interpretability and accuracy in symbolic regression tasks.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents ReCalX, a method to recalibrate machine learning models for better perturbation-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliability in perturbation-based explanations caused by misaligned model confidence and actual accuracy under perturbations.

Method: The authors theoretically assess the issue of miscalibrated model probability estimates under perturbations and introduce ReCalX, a recalibration technique addressing this, while maintaining the original predictions.

Result: ReCalX improves the reliability of perturbation-based explanations, enhancing alignment with human perception and actual object locations in computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: ReCalX successfully enhances transparency and quality of explanations for machine learning models by ensuring better uncertainty calibration.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in forecasting target variables coherently across temporal hierarchies, which is critical for profit-optimized decision-making in business applications.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical architecture comprising modules tailored to different temporal aggregation levels, with hidden layers encoding the average behavior of the target variable.

Result: The proposed architecture achieves accurate and coherent forecasts across temporal scales and outperforms methods like TSMixer on the M5 dataset.

Conclusion: The hierarchical architecture offers a significant improvement for temporal hierarchical forecasting, demonstrating superior accuracy and coherence in predictions.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse
and fine temporal scales is crucial for profit-optimized decision-making in
several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

### [237] [Unsupervised Data Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Perspective from Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19643)
*Shuncheng He,Hongchang Zhang,Jianzhun Shao,Yuhang Jiang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a solution to address the performance gap in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing Unsupervised Data Generation (UDG), showing improved results in task-agnostic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the performance issues in offline RL caused by the out-of-distribution problem and to investigate the influence of batch data rather than restricting in-sample action sampling.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the impact of state-action pair distribution differences on offline RL performance. They propose UDG, an unsupervised data generation approach, to minimize worst-case regret in task-agnostic settings.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate that UDG outperforms supervised data generation methods in addressing unknown tasks in offline RL.

Conclusion: UDG is an effective method for improving offline RL performance and minimizing the performance gap through unsupervised data generation in task-agnostic scenarios.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAAT-Net, a technique to reduce the tensor-parallel communication during LLM training without significantly affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the heavy bandwidth demands of current tensor-parallelism techniques during Large Language Model (LLM) training.

Method: Introduce CAAT-Net, a communication-aware architecture that requires fewer synchronization steps in tensor-parallel training of LLMs.

Result: CAAT-Net reduces tensor-parallel communication by 50% during training while maintaining accuracy in 1B and 7B parameter models.

Conclusion: CAAT-Net is effective in reducing tensor-parallel communication overhead, accelerating training and inference for LLMs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

*Mihnea Ghitu,Matthew Wicker,Vihari Piratla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach to mitigate shortcut learning by optimizing explanation robustness, improving misclassification performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent machine learning models from relying on irrelevant or misleading features (shortcut features), which can lead to harmful real-world consequences.

Method: A simplified objective is introduced that simultaneously optimizes explanation robustness and mitigates shortcut learning, with theoretical justification of its effectiveness.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a 20% reduction in test-time misclassifications compared to existing methods and provides insights into annotation quality and quantity.

Conclusion: The approach is an effective alternative for addressing shortcut learning in models, showing robust results across domains like NLP and medical imaging.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

### [240] [When Can We Reuse a Calibration Set for Multiple Conformal Predictions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19689)
*A. A. Balinsky,A. D. Balinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to reuse a single calibration set multiple times for reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in inductive conformal prediction need a fresh calibration set for each new prediction, limiting their practicality for trustworthy machine learning applications.

Method: The authors combined e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to estimate a correction using a single calibration set, enabling modified Markov's inequality and construction of prediction sets with high confidence.

Result: The approach was demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that prediction sets could be constructed with provable performance, thereby reducing the repeated calibration requirement.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances the practicality of conformal prediction methods, maintaining reliable performance while simplifying the calibration process. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

*Jungwoo Park,Taewhoo Lee,Chanwoong Yoon,Hyeon Hwang,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses activation outliers in large language models (LLMs) that hamper quantization efficiency, introducing a proactive approach called Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) to mitigate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation outliers degrade quantization performance in LLMs, posing challenges for their efficient deployment. Current solutions focus on post-hoc mitigation but remain insufficient.

Method: The paper introduces OSP, which combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection, aiming to proactively prevent outlier formation during pre-training instead of post-hoc adjustments.

Result: Using OSP, a 1.4B-parameter model was trained on 1 trillion tokens without outliers, achieving improved performance under 4-bit quantization (35.7 average score vs. 26.5 for Adam-trained models) with minimal training overhead and reduced excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers in LLMs are training-strategy-induced rather than inherent, and OSP offers a practical and efficient solution for more effective deployment by addressing outlier formation proactively.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints
are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Outlier-Safe-Pre-Training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition to reduce memory requirements in continual learning algorithms while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing memory footprint in continual learning is essential to address catastrophic forgetting while preserving relevant information.

Method: The authors employ lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition that require minimal memory, no training, and a single linear-time fitting step to enhance continual learning methods.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in average accuracy for existing methods like A-GEM and Experience Replay, depending on dataset and network architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows strong potential for reducing memory needs in memory-based continual learning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReBoot introduces a neural network framework enabling fully encrypted training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with reduced computational overhead and increased efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about confidential data processing emphasize the need for privacy-preserving deep learning techniques that support encrypted training.

Method: ReBoot employs the CKKS scheme using local error signals, tailored packing strategies, and approximate bootstrapping to train deep neural networks efficiently under Homomorphic Encryption.

Result: ReBoot achieves comparable accuracy to plaintext training, surpasses encrypted logistic regression and other frameworks in test accuracy, and reduces training latency significantly.

Conclusion: ReBoot advances encrypted DNN training by offering a robust, efficient, and high-performing neural network solution, paving the way for secure machine learning as a service.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

*Nathan Maurer,Harshal Kaushik,Roshni Anna Jacob,Jie Zhang,Souma Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel graph-based framework for efficient resource allocation during critical infrastructure restoration, integrating graph reinforcement learning and bigraph matching to outperform existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical need for a rapid and efficient restoration of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) post-disruption, focusing on optimizing resource allocation to regain operational functionality efficiently.

Method: A graph-based approach merges crew, transportation, and power grid nodes into a heterogeneous graph. Graph reinforcement learning (GRL) and bigraph matching are utilized to design incentive functions for restoration task allocation, trained using neural networks and Neuroevolution.

Result: The approach demonstrated 3-fold improvement over random allocation strategies and outperformed optimization-based solutions significantly in both computational efficiency and power restored, as validated on a realistic test case.

Conclusion: The proposed method generalizes well across varying scenarios, offering a scalable and computationally efficient solution to a combinatorial restoration problem, proving beneficial for disaster response and infrastructure resilience.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,

scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power

### [245] [Guidance in the Frequency Domain Enables High-Fidelity Sampling at Low CFG Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19713)
*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Tobias Vontobel,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores classifier-free guidance (CFG) through frequency domain analysis and proposes frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG) for enhanced image quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the mechanisms of CFG's effectiveness in conditional diffusion models and address its limitations.

Method: Analyze CFG's effects in frequency domain and develop FDG, which separates guidance into low- and high-frequency components with tailored strengths for each.

Result: FDG improves sample fidelity, preserves diversity, and achieves better FID and recall scores compared to CFG.

Conclusion: FDG offers a plug-and-play alternative for conditional diffusion models, overcoming CFG's drawbacks and improving overall performance.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

### [246] [Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19830)
*Yichao Fu,Rui Ge,Zelei Shao,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methodologies to significantly improve the speed of reasoning models, leveraging Lookahead Reasoning (LR) alongside Speculative Decoding (SD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models are bottlenecked by slow decoding speeds when generating long chain-of-thought outputs. Current speculative decoding techniques provide only modest speedups due to inherent limitations.

Method: Lookahead Reasoning combines two layers of parallelism: the first layer uses lightweight models to propose multiple steps ahead semantically, and the second ensures corrections through a verifier and token-level speculative decoding. This hybrid approach multiplies efficiency.

Result: Empirically, LR demonstrated a speedup improvement from 1.4x to 2.1x compared to SD while maintaining output quality across multiple benchmarks such as GSM8K and AIME.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively increases reasoning model speed while maintaining accuracy, offering scalable improvements with additional GPU throughput.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

*Shrey Dixit,Kayson Fakhar,Fatemeh Hadaeghi,Patrick Mineault,Konrad P. Kording,Claus C. Hilgetag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA) for understanding the contributions of neural units to high-dimensional model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in existing explainable-AI methods by providing a way to quantify neural unit contributions across high-dimensional outputs.

Method: MSA systematically lesions combinations of neural units and applies a game-theoretic Shapley value framework for contribution mapping.

Result: MSA exposes computation hubs, language-specific experts, and pixel-generation hierarchies in GANs, demonstrating utility across various scales of neural networks.

Conclusion: MSA is a versatile tool for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks effectively.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

### [248] [Orthogonal Finetuning Made Scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19847)
*Zeju Qiu,Weiyang Liu,Adrian Weller,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFTv2 enhances Orthogonal Finetuning with reduced computational and memory demands using a reformulated input-centric approach and efficient parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthogonal finetuning had high runtime and memory usage issues despite its efficiency and prevention of catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The paper reformulated OFT from weight-centric to input-centric computation, introduced matrix-vector computation (matrix-free), and employed Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal parameterization.

Result: OFTv2 achieves up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory consumption, with stable performance and support for quantized models.

Conclusion: OFTv2 is a practical, efficient, and improved solution for finetuning, outperforming alternatives in stability, efficiency, and resource management.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

### [249] [DRIFT: Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation- Generalization Begins Before Deep Learning starts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19734)
*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation) innovatively preprocesses data using physics-inspired methods to extract key features, enabling smaller input dimensions (~50 features) while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning architectures often excel at optimization but struggle with achieving efficiency and interpretability in the initial data preparation phase. This research aims to solve the bottleneck of effective input curation.

Method: DRIFT utilizes vibrational analysis from physical systems to extract salient features, projecting images onto spatial vibration mode shapes. This reduces input dimensionality while retaining essential data characteristics.

Result: The study shows that DRIFT significantly improves training stability, generalization robustness, and resistance to overfitting compared to pixel-based models and PCA on MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.

Conclusion: DRIFT emphasizes the importance of input curation and demonstrates how physics-guided preprocessing can advance deep learning performance, shifting focus away from architectural complexities.

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

### [250] [On the necessity of adaptive regularisation:Optimal anytime online learning on $\boldsymbol{\ell_p}$-balls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19752)
*Emmeran Johnson,David Martínez-Rubio,Ciara Pike-Burke,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates optimal regret in online convex optimization for high-dimensional \(\ell_p\)-balls, finding adaptive regularization necessary for optimality across dimensional regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how dimension impacts regret behavior in online convex optimization tasks and analyze the feasibility of fixed regularization strategies across dimensionality scales.

Method: They utilize Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with dynamic, dimension-adaptive regularization and examine the limitations of fixed non-adaptive regularizers.

Result: Adaptive regularization is shown to be essential for optimal online convex optimization across dimension ranges. Fixed regularization results in suboptimal outcomes depending on the dimensional regime.

Conclusion: Anytime optimality in online convex optimization necessitates adaptivity in regularizers, as fixed regularizers fail to provide optimal performance across variable dimensions. Lower bounds confirm challenges for linear bandits in high dimensions for \(\ell_p\)-balls with \(p \geq 1\).

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

*Yuhui Sun,Xiyao Wang,Zixi Li,Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, to improve language model alignment by incorporating multiple human preference dimensions and enabling dynamic interpolation, overcoming limitations of existing techniques like RLHF and static DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent difficulty in directing the behavior of large-scale unsupervised language models toward specific objectives without explicit supervision motivates this work, especially given the computational challenges and instability of existing alignment methods like RLHF.

Method: The paper proposes Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, an extension of DPO, which uses a simplex-weighted formulation for flexible alignment. It facilitates listwise preference feedback and supports dynamic interpolation across multiple human preference dimensions without requiring re-training.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the new framework maintains effectiveness comparable to traditional DPO for static objectives but demonstrates improved adaptability and flexibility for dynamic, real-world deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses key limitations of existing alignment techniques by enabling flexible multi-objective alignment and dynamic adaptability, making it potentially useful for real-world language model applications.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive weighting scheme for Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enhance their accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the accuracy and convergence challenges in PINNs caused by optimizing over a finite set of points.

Method: Development of an adaptive weighting scheme that adjusts loss function weights from isolated points to continuous neighborhood regions.

Result: The proposed scheme reduced the relative $L^2$ errors, improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting approach enhances the performance of PINNs in solving PDEs with lower errors.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

### [253] [Ambiguous Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19810)
*Vanessa Kosoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ambiguous online learning' where predictions can be ambiguous, meaning multiple labels can be correct as long as no label is 'predictably wrong.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prediction scenarios involving multivalued dynamical systems, recommendation algorithms, and lossless compression, where ambiguous predictions are natural.

Method: They define a framework for ambiguous predictions, using a hypothesis class with multi-valued outcomes to assess correctness and wrongness, and derive mistake bounds for this setting.

Result: There is a trichotomy of mistake bounds in this setting: Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)), or N, depending on the hypothesis class.

Conclusion: The framework provides a structured approach for ambiguous prediction and reveals fundamental mistake-bound behaviors in hypothesis classes under this model.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

### [254] [Curating art exhibitions using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19813)
*Eurico Covas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores AI models to replicate human art curatorship using machine learning based on the past exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to examine if AI can replicate the subjective art curatorship traditionally accomplished by human experts, leveraging data from past exhibitions.

Method: The research uses four machine learning models trained on data from Metropolitan Museum exhibitions, focusing on model design and feature engineering for effective curatorial imitation.

Result: The AI models successfully imitate human curatorship, achieving accuracy above random selection and comparable performance to large language models, with carefully designed architectures.

Conclusion: AI can replicate certain aspects of art curatorship and perform effectively with smaller, well-designed models, with potential improvement given access to more data.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenge of unintended misalignment in language models caused by specific training or fine-tuning, using methodologies such as sparse autoencoders and investigating potential mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand how language models generalize potentially harmful behaviors from training to broader use cases, contributing to AI safety development.

Method: Techniques like 'model diffing' with sparse autoencoders were applied to analyze model representation before and after fine-tuning, identifying features responsible for misaligned personas.

Result: They found specific toxic persona features linked to emergent misalignment and showed that fine-tuning on a small benign dataset effectively counteracts misalignment.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment in AI models can be diagnosed and mitigated using structured approaches, ensuring safer deployment and behavior alignment.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

*Boxuan Zhang,Zhen Xu,Kuan Tao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Regularization Training (TRT) for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to address overfitting and gradient mismatching issues, improving generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly trained SNNs face overfitting due to small neuromorphic datasets and gradient mismatching issues, limiting their generalization ability.

Method: The paper proposes TRT, a training method that applies time-dependent regularization, emphasizing stronger constraints on early timesteps. The method includes Fisher information analysis to explain its mechanism.

Result: TRT mitigates overfitting, flattens the loss landscape, and demonstrates enhanced generalizability on multiple datasets like CIFAR10/100 and DVS-CIFAR10.

Conclusion: Temporal Regularization Training concentrates Fisher information on early timesteps, enabling SNNs to learn robust features and significantly improve generalization performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Method: The study developed a unified evaluation platform for synapse models and assessed their performance in a two-layer SNN with LIF neurons on MNIST classification. Both small train sets and large test sets were used.

Result: The SNN with ideal, 25-state, and 12-state nonlinear memristor synapses achieved accuracies of 92.73%, 91.07%, and 80%, respectively, and outperformed ANN/CNN baselines in convergence speed and parameter economy.

Conclusion: Memristor-based SNNs can achieve competitive accuracy while being more resource-efficient, highlighting their potential for hardware-efficient neural computing.

Abstract: We develop a unified platform to evaluate Ideal, Linear, and Non-linear

converging faster and using fewer parameters than comparable ANN/CNN baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) in solving complex, abstract reasoning tasks requiring precise transformations and few-shot generalization, as applied to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC).

Method: The paper employs gradient-based training to develop iterative update rules in NCAs, which perform transformations from input grids to outputs in ARC-based tasks. The behavior and properties of the NCAs under various design and training conditions were analyzed.

Conclusion: NCAs, when trained with gradient-based approaches, are an effective method for solving abstract reasoning and grid-based transformation tasks, offering insights into their broader applications in self-organizing systems.

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular
Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex
behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and

applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing

*Yifan Zong,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MoLE, a new architecture for multilingual programming support, combining efficiency and specialization through shared and language-specific LoRA modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multilingual programming either sacrifice performance by using a single LLM across all languages or incur high costs by finetuning separate LLMs for each language.

Method: MoLE utilizes a base model with both shared and language-specific LoRA modules, optimized jointly during finetuning for knowledge sharing and specialization. Language-specific inference is handled automatically.

Result: MoLE achieves better parameter efficiency compared to separate language-specific LoRAs and outperforms a single shared LLM trained on all programming languages.

Conclusion: MoLE effectively balances efficiency and performance for multilingual programming tasks, making it a promising solution for code generation and comprehension across various languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the data-autonomous paradigm for parallel programming and presents the language AuDaLa, focusing on collaborative data elements for computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parallel languages focus primarily on threads and processors, making data and memory management challenging and distancing implementation from its algorithmic roots.

Method: The authors propose a new programming paradigm centered on autonomous data elements, formalize it via AuDaLa with a type system and operational semantics, and illustrate its usage through examples.

Result: AuDaLa simplifies programming for data collaboration in parallel systems and allows formal verification of parallel programs.

Conclusion: The data-autonomous paradigm offers a natural and innovative approach for parallel programming and enhances formal verification, though it constitutes a departure from current programming styles.

Abstract: Nowadays, the main advances in computational power are due to parallelism.
However, most parallel languages have been designed with a focus on processors
and threads. This makes dealing with data and memory in programs hard, which
distances the implementation from its original algorithm. We propose a new
paradigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, where
computation is performed by autonomous data elements. Programs in this paradigm
are focused on making the data collaborate in a highly parallel fashion. We
furthermore present AuDaLa, the first data autonomous programming language, and
provide a full formalisation that includes a type system and operational
semantics. Programming in AuDaLa is very natural, as illustrated by examples,
albeit in a style very different from sequential and contemporary parallel
programming. Additionally, it lends itself for the formal verification of
parallel programs, which we demonstrate.

### [261] [FORTE: Tactile Force and Slip Sensing on Compliant Fingers for Delicate Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18960)
*Siqi Shang,Mingyo Seo,Yuke Zhu,Lilly Chin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORTE is a tactile sensing system integrated into compliant gripper fingers that achieves precise and responsive grasping of fragile objects using 3D-printed fin-ray grippers with internal air channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gripping delicate and fragile objects is challenging for rigid parallel robotic grippers due to their dependence on visual feedback and lack of compliance.

Method: The authors developed FORTE, a 3D-printed tactile gripper system with internal air channels for low-latency force and slip feedback, combining soft robotics and tactile sensing technologies.

Result: FORTE estimates grasping forces with 0.2 N error within a range of 0-8 N, identifies slip events within 100 ms, and successfully grasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success rate.

Conclusion: FORTE proves effective for handling delicate and deformable objects, offering an easy-to-fabricate and robust solution for improving robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Handling delicate and fragile objects remains a major challenge for robotic
manipulation, especially for rigid parallel grippers. While the simplicity and
versatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these
grippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile
sensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,
existing methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from
slow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system
embedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers
with internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.
FORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while
remaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately
estimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect
slip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp
a wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE
grasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success
rate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events. These results
highlight FORTE's potential as a robust and practical solution for enabling
delicate robotic manipulation. Project page: https://merge-lab.github.io/FORTE

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces stochastic restart techniques to improve motion planning algorithms, showing significant speedups and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomized motion planning methods like PRM and RRT suffer from performance instability in certain cases.

Method: Stochastic restart techniques and new algorithm variants were applied to enhance the performance of Las Vegas algorithms.

Result: Experiments showed faster runtimes, shorter paths, and efficiency gains in multi-threading, outperforming parallel implementations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are optimal, practical, and open source, with demonstrated benefits in motion planning tasks.

Abstract: Randomized methods such as PRM and RRT are widely used in motion planning.
However, in some cases, their running-time suffers from inherent instability,
leading to ``catastrophic'' performance even for relatively simple instances.
We apply stochastic restart techniques, some of them new, for speeding up Las
Vegas algorithms, that provide dramatic speedups in practice (a factor of $3$
[or larger] in many cases).
  Our experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms have faster runtimes,
shorter paths, and greater gains from multi-threading (when compared with
straightforward parallel implementation). We prove the optimality of the new
variants. Our implementation is open source, available on github, and is easy
to deploy and use.

Motivation: To address labor shortages and productivity stagnation in the construction industry through automation, enhancing infrastructure development's sustainability.

Method: The system integrates autonomous navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization for material transport. It has fundamental investigations into perception and mapping but lacks dynamic environment adaptation.

Result: Preliminary results identify challenges like navigating changing terrain, environmental perception in construction conditions, and optimizing sensor placement.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a vision for collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapting to site conditions, optimizing workflows, and reducing human involvement while providing foundational insights into robotics in construction automation.

Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the
construction industry, automation has become essential for sustainable
infrastructure development. This paper presents an autonomous payload
transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction
sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous
navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization to facilitate
material transport in construction site environments. While the current system
does not yet incorporate dynamic environment adaptation algorithms, we have
begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and
mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges,
including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under
construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for
improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction
ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site
conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper
provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction
automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.

### [264] [Multimodal Anomaly Detection with a Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19077)
*Christoph Willibald,Daniel Sliwowski,Dongheui Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal anomaly detection framework for robotic manipulation, integrating visual-language and statistical models to address both robot-driven and environment-driven anomalies, showing improved speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in robotics is crucial due to the increasing deployment of robots in diverse applications and the need to address failures arising from both robot-driven and environment-driven sources.

Method: The authors propose a mixture-of-experts framework combining visual-language models for environment monitoring and Gaussian-mixture regression for tracking forces and motions, with a confidence-based fusion mechanism to select the most reliable detector dynamically.

Result: The approach demonstrated a reduction in detection delay by 60% and improved frame-wise anomaly detection performance in household and industrial robotic tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures anomalies from multiple sources, offering significant improvements over existing individual anomaly detection methodologies.

Abstract: With a growing number of robots being deployed across diverse applications,
robust multimodal anomaly detection becomes increasingly important. In robotic
manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to
an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven
anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences.
Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level
statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep
learning-based visual environment observation, each with different
computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies
from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates
the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for
environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for
tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a
confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable
detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and
industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in
detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance
compared to individual detectors.

*Rom Levy,Ari Dantus,Zitao Yu,Yizhar Or*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies the dynamics of a two-link Twistcar model with friction and showcases a robotic prototype that can reverse its direction under geometric and mass adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of studies on energy dissipation due to friction in the dynamical analysis of underactuated wheeled vehicles like the Twistcar.

Method: Incorporating rolling resistance in a theoretical model, obtaining asymptotic expressions for the system's dynamics, designing a robotic prototype, and conducting parameter fitting for friction resistance.

Result: Revealed steady-state periodic dynamics and the possibility of motion reversal by varying mass and geometry, validated through a robotic prototype and experiments.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating friction in modeling, and highlight the design and experimental verification of a novel motion-reversal capability for underactuated vehicles.

Abstract: Underactuated wheeled vehicles are commonly studied as nonholonomic systems
with periodic actuation. Twistcar is a classical example inspired by a riding
toy, which has been analyzed using a planar model of a dynamical system with
nonholonomic constraints. Most of the previous analyses did not account for
energy dissipation due to friction. In this work, we study a theoretical
two-link model of the Twistcar while incorporating dissipation due to rolling
resistance. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the system's small-amplitude
steady-state periodic dynamics, which reveals the possibility of reversing the
direction of motion upon varying the geometric and mass properties of the
vehicle. Next, we design and construct a robotic prototype of the Twistcar
whose center-of-mass position can be shifted by adding and removing a massive
block, enabling demonstration of the Twistcar's direction reversal phenomenon.
We also conduct parameter fitting for the frictional resistance in order to
improve agreement with experiments.

### [266] [CUPID: Curating Data your Robot Loves with Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19121)
*Christopher Agia,Rohan Sinha,Jingyun Yang,Rika Antonova,Marco Pavone,Haruki Nishimura,Masha Itkina,Jeannette Bohg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CUPID is a data curation method for robot imitation learning that ranks and selects demonstrations based on their influence on policy performance, enabling significant efficiency and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the individual contribution of demonstrations to policy performance is critical for improving imitation learning, but it remains a challenge.

Method: CUPID utilizes influence function theory to assess and rank training demonstrations based on their impact on imitation learning policies' expected return, enabling filtering and sub-selection of impactful data.

Result: The method improves training efficiency by achieving state-of-the-art policies with less than 33% of curated data and shows robustness to distribution shifts and other challenges in both simulated and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: CUPID offers a systematic approach for robot data curation, potentially advancing the efficiency and reliability of training imitation learning policies.

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

### [267] [Situated Haptic Interaction: Exploring the Role of Context in Affective Perception of Robotic Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19179)
*Qiaoqiao Ren,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines how situational emotional cues influence the interpretation of haptic signals from robots, revealing that visual context often shapes perception more than haptic cues, and highlights the potential for haptics to enhance emotional communication in human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how haptic feedback can influence emotional exchanges in human-robot interaction, particularly addressing its underexplored role in dynamic affective contexts.

Method: 32 participants watched videos showing a robot undergoing positive, negative, or neutral events. After each video, they received haptic communication via a wearable vibration sleeve to perceive the robot’s emotional state based on valence and arousal.

Result: The perception of haptic feedback was significantly influenced by the emotional context of the video. Visual cues often dominated perceived valence, with negative haptics amplifying emotional intensity and positive cues softening it, while haptics influenced perceived arousal more strongly.

Conclusion: Haptic feedback, when integrated with contextual cues, has the potential to create richer and more embodied human-robot interactions, offering new directions for affective communication with machines.

Abstract: Affective interaction is not merely about recognizing emotions; it is an
embodied, situated process shaped by context and co-created through
interaction. In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic
emotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how
situational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of
haptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants
watched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions
(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral
actions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through
haptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the
participant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence
(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic
feedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay
between visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic
feedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual
context often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative
haptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive
cues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of
arousal of the video. Together, these results offer insights into how situated
haptic feedback can enrich affective human-robot interaction, pointing toward
more nuanced and embodied approaches to emotional communication with machines.

*Hanyang Zhou,Haozhe Lou,Wenhao Liu,Enyu Zhao,Yue Wang,Daniel Seita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The MOTIF hand is a novel and cost-effective, multimodal robotic hand with advanced sensory capabilities for dexterous manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-fingered robotic hands lack essential sensory capabilities such as onboard thermal and torque sensing, limiting their dexterity and functionality.

Method: The MOTIF hand integrates dense tactile sensing, thermal and depth cameras, IMU sensors, and a visual sensor, at a cost of under $4000. Experiments were conducted to validate its sensing capabilities in tasks like temperature-aware grasping and distinguishing objects with identical appearances but different masses.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that the MOTIF hand successfully utilizes its multimodal sensors for safe, temperature-aware 3D reconstruction-based grasping and effectively distinguishes objects based on mass.

Conclusion: This work presents a versatile and reproducible robotic hand with advanced multimodal sensing, addressing limitations of existing designs and demonstrating enhanced manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Advancing dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered robotic hands requires
rich sensory capabilities, while existing designs lack onboard thermal and
torque sensing. In this work, we propose the MOTIF hand, a novel multimodal and
versatile robotic hand that extends the LEAP hand by integrating: (i) dense
tactile information across the fingers, (ii) a depth sensor, (iii) a thermal
camera, (iv), IMU sensors, and (v) a visual sensor. The MOTIF hand is designed
to be relatively low-cost (under 4000 USD) and easily reproducible. We validate
our hand design through experiments that leverage its multimodal sensing for
two representative tasks. First, we integrate thermal sensing into 3D
reconstruction to guide temperature-aware, safe grasping. Second, we show how
our hand can distinguish objects with identical appearance but different masses
- a capability beyond methods that use vision only.

### [269] [Preserving Sense of Agency: User Preferences for Robot Autonomy and User Control across Household Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19202)
*Claire Yang,Heer Patel,Max Kleiman-Weiner,Maya Cakmak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores user preferences for robot autonomy and how it affects their sense of control in assistive home robotics, finding that people prefer more control in risky scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether users prefer fully autonomous assistive robots or partial autonomy based on their sense of control and the context of use.

Method: Conducted a study where participants rated their sense of agency across four robot autonomy levels and ranked preferences for robots handling various household tasks.

Result: Participants' sense of control was influenced by robot autonomy and third-party involvement. High-risk scenarios elevated the preference for user control, even if autonomy was reduced.

Conclusion: End-user programmable robots maintain user control perceptions, but the context of use, particularly risk level and trust in operators, is key in shaping autonomy preferences.

Abstract: Roboticists often design with the assumption that assistive robots should be
fully autonomous. However, it remains unclear whether users prefer highly
autonomous robots, as prior work in assistive robotics suggests otherwise. High
robot autonomy can reduce the user's sense of agency, which represents feeling
in control of one's environment. How much control do users, in fact, want over
the actions of robots used for in-home assistance? We investigate how robot
autonomy levels affect users' sense of agency and the autonomy level they
prefer in contexts with varying risks. Our study asked participants to rate
their sense of agency as robot users across four distinct autonomy levels and
ranked their robot preferences with respect to various household tasks. Our
findings revealed that participants' sense of agency was primarily influenced
by two factors: (1) whether the robot acts autonomously, and (2) whether a
third party is involved in the robot's programming or operation. Notably, an
end-user programmed robot highly preserved users' sense of agency, even though
it acts autonomously. However, in high-risk settings, e.g., preparing a snack
for a child with allergies, they preferred robots that prioritized their
control significantly more. Additional contextual factors, such as trust in a
third party operator, also shaped their preferences.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to train dexterous robotic hands using vision-language models (VLMs) to generate task-relevant trajectories and utilizes reinforcement learning to refine them, achieving robust manipulation in simulation and real-world scenarios without human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous robotic hands are difficult to train due to challenges in demonstration collection and reward design, necessitating scalable and generalized methods for training policies.

Method: The approach combines vision-language models to identify key points and synthesize coarse 3D trajectories, and reinforcement learning refines policies to track these trajectories with high fidelity.

Result: The method successfully learns dexterous manipulation policies for various simulated tasks and transfers them to real-world robotic hands, eliminating the need for human demos or custom rewards.

Conclusion: Vision-language models simplify task generation for dexterous manipulation, enabling scalable and robust training of robotic hands through simulation with real-world applicability without relying on reference trajectories or task-specific rewards.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation
tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration
collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can
alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it
typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which
hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous
manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These
trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL
policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,
sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a
significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference
trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our
key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the
commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide
exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet")
and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify
task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D
trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a
low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories
or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving
articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method
is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase
that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human
demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.

TL;DR: AnchorDP3 is a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in randomized environments with a success rate of 98.7% in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robotic manipulation framework that can handle diverse tasks in highly randomized environments without requiring human demonstrations.

Method: The framework incorporates Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, and Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision to simplify learning and boost robot performance.

Result: AnchorDP3 exhibited an average success rate of 98.7% in RoboTwin benchmarks under extreme randomization conditions.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for enabling fully autonomous generation of visuomotor policies for robotic tasks without human demonstrations.

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous robotic systems excel in geometric and dynamic reasoning but lack relational semantics and cognitive transparency for effective collaboration in human-centric environments.

Method: The Ontology Neural Network (ONN) is used for formalizing relational reasoning, embedding advanced mathematical tools like Forman-Ricci curvature and persistent homology. The Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) is designed for transforming reasoning into robust control commands while addressing delays.

Result: Empirical studies show the framework unifies semantic cognition and robust control under dynamic conditions, solving latency and relational representation challenges.

Conclusion: Introducing ONN and ORTSF addresses gaps in cognitive reasoning and actionable control in robotics, offering both mathematical rigor and practical applicability.

Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive
capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a
fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and
dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational
semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for
collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a
unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the
Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN
formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By
embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor
structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational
integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time.
The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while
compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware
operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control
signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies
demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and
robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable
solution for cognitive robotics.

Motivation: Enhancing robotic manipulation through accurate, safe, and efficient handling of objects by inferring physical properties.

Method: Developing a novel framework integrating vision and tactile data in a multimodal vision-language model, incorporating hierarchical feature alignment and refined prompting strategies.

Result: The framework outperformed existing methods on property-specific predictions across 35 objects, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: This paper develops a probabilistic modeling and risk analysis framework to ensure the safety of agricultural robots, focusing on obstacle and human detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring farmers trust agricultural robots, particularly in terms of reliability and safety, necessitating a focus on obstacle detection and risk mitigation.

Method: Development of probabilistic models and state machines for robot behavior and human interaction, analyzed using the PRISM model checker.

Result: Quantitative insights into risk mitigation's effectiveness within varying design concepts, including object detection systems and human warning mechanisms.

Conclusion: While focused on early development phases, the framework is applicable across the lifecycle of agricultural robot systems for safety assurance.

Abstract: Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in
the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates
our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability
to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a
probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early
development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk
assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and
perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state
machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed
using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight
into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect
of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct
design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance
and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate
warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses
on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance
framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and
operation phases.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for identifying industrial robot parameters using Bayesian statistics, incorporating prior knowledge, and capable of zero-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying robot parameters rely heavily on measurements and do not utilize prior robot information, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed method uses Bayesian-inspired techniques to incorporate priors and enable parameter identification, even with minimal or zero measurements.

Result: The method successfully identifies inertial, mechanical, and base parameters of the MABI Max 100 robot while ensuring physical feasibility and providing confidence intervals.

Conclusion: This Bayesian-based approach improves generalization, reduces reliance on extensive measurements, and delivers robust parameter identification for industrial robots.

Abstract: Inertial parameter identification of industrial robots is an established
process, but standard methods using Least Squares or Machine Learning do not
consider prior information about the robot and require extensive measurements.
Inspired by Bayesian statistics, this paper presents an identification method
with improved generalization that incorporates prior knowledge and is able to
learn with only a few or without additional measurements (Zero-Shot Learning).
Furthermore, our method is able to correctly learn not only the inertial but
also the mechanical and base parameters of the MABI Max 100 robot while
ensuring physical feasibility and specifying the confidence intervals of the
results. We also provide different types of priors for serial robots with 6
degrees of freedom, where datasheets or CAD models are not available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a safety assurance methodology for agricultural robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying risks and verifying safety-critical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous robots in dynamic and unstructured environments like agriculture.

Method: A verification workflow encompassing hazard analysis, risk assessment, formal modeling of safety controllers, and runtime verification.

Result: The methodology successfully verifies safety-critical properties and aids in the early identification of design issues for a field robot.

Conclusion: The approach supports the development of safer autonomous systems by ensuring rigorous safety assurance throughout the robot's lifecycle.

Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural
settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability
and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured
environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide
range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the
safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire
development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification.
The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk
assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety
requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to
capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified
safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is
demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results
show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical
properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues,
contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.

TL;DR: This paper reviews adaptability in soft robots, categorized as external and internal, and explores strategies, applications, limitations, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots are gaining prominence due to their flexibility, compliance, safety, and adaptability, making them increasingly relevant across fields like surgery and wearable devices.

Method: The paper categorizes adaptability in soft robots into external and internal and reviews design, sensing, control strategies, applications, and challenges.

Result: Various methods to improve soft robot adaptability are summarized, including strategies for design, sensing, and control. Applications like surgery and locomotion are also analyzed.

Conclusion: The paper highlights adaptability as crucial for soft robotics and offers insights into its applications, limitations, and future research directions.

Abstract: Soft robots, compared to rigid robots, possess inherent advantages, including
higher degrees of freedom, compliance, and enhanced safety, which have
contributed to their increasing application across various fields. Among these
benefits, adaptability is particularly noteworthy. In this paper, adaptability
in soft robots is categorized into external and internal adaptability. External
adaptability refers to the robot's ability to adjust, either passively or
actively, to variations in environments, object properties, geometries, and
task dynamics. Internal adaptability refers to the robot's ability to cope with
internal variations, such as manufacturing tolerances or material aging, and to
generalize control strategies across different robots. As the field of soft
robotics continues to evolve, the significance of adaptability has become
increasingly pronounced. In this review, we summarize various approaches to
enhancing the adaptability of soft robots, including design, sensing, and
control strategies. Additionally, we assess the impact of adaptability on
applications such as surgery, wearable devices, locomotion, and manipulation.
We also discuss the limitations of soft robotics adaptability and prospective
directions for future research. By analyzing adaptability through the lenses of
implementation, application, and challenges, this paper aims to provide a
comprehensive understanding of this essential characteristic in soft robotics
and its implications for diverse applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates ground effect-induced challenges in multicopters, including external torques, control errors, and airflow impacts on rotor drag and mixing matrix. A new control method reduces errors by 45.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges multicopters face when flying near the ground due to added lift, oscillations, and dynamic disturbances.

Method: The paper analyzed ground effect dynamics through both data collection (force platforms and real-world flights) and mathematical modeling, proposing a control method integrating dynamic inverse and disturbance compensation.

Result: Experimental findings reveal a significant reduction of control error (RMSE) by 45.3%, validating the proposed control approach.

Conclusion: The proposed disturbance compensation method effectively mitigates ground effect-induced issues, ensuring improved control dynamics for multicopters at varying altitudes.

Abstract: The ground effect on multicopters introduces several challenges, such as
control errors caused by additional lift, oscillations that may occur during
near-ground flight due to external torques, and the influence of ground airflow
on models such as the rotor drag and the mixing matrix. This article collects
and analyzes the dynamics data of near-ground multicopter flight through
various methods, including force measurement platforms and real-world flights.
For the first time, we summarize the mathematical model of the external torque
of multicopters under ground effect. The influence of ground airflow on rotor
drag and the mixing matrix is also verified through adequate experimentation
and analysis. Through simplification and derivation, the differential flatness
of the multicopter's dynamic model under ground effect is confirmed. To
mitigate the influence of these disturbance models on control, we propose a
control method that combines dynamic inverse and disturbance models, ensuring
consistent control effectiveness at both high and low altitudes. In this
method, the additional thrust and variations in rotor drag under ground effect
are both considered and compensated through feedforward models. The leveling
torque of ground effect can be equivalently represented as variations in the
center of gravity and the moment of inertia. In this way, the leveling torque
does not explicitly appear in the dynamic model. The final experimental results
show that the method proposed in this paper reduces the control error (RMSE) by
\textbf{45.3\%}. Please check the supplementary material at:

*Yiteng Chen,Wenbo Li,Shiyi Wang,Huiping Zhuang,Qingyao Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-Rex, a framework that dynamically selects spatial representation schemes for robotic tasks, offering improved spatial understanding and operational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rigid and inefficient spatial representation extraction systems in VLM-based robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The authors propose T-Rex, a task-adaptive framework that determines appropriate spatial representation schemes according to task complexity and requirements, balancing representational ability and operational costs.

Result: The experiments in real-world robotic environments show that T-Rex enhances spatial understanding, efficiency, and stability, all while requiring no additional training.

Conclusion: T-Rex demonstrates that dynamically choosing spatial extraction methods based on task needs leads to better performance and adaptability in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Building a general robotic manipulation system capable of performing a wide
variety of tasks in real-world settings is a challenging task. Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation
tasks, primarily due to the extensive world knowledge they gain from
large-scale datasets. In this process, Spatial Representations (such as points
representing object positions or vectors representing object orientations) act
as a bridge between VLMs and real-world scene, effectively grounding the
reasoning abilities of VLMs and applying them to specific task scenarios.
However, existing VLM-based robotic approaches often adopt a fixed spatial
representation extraction scheme for various tasks, resulting in insufficient
representational capability or excessive extraction time. In this work, we
introduce T-Rex, a Task-Adaptive Framework for Spatial Representation
Extraction, which dynamically selects the most appropriate spatial
representation extraction scheme for each entity based on specific task
requirements. Our key insight is that task complexity determines the types and
granularity of spatial representations, and Stronger representational
capabilities are typically associated with Higher overall system operation
costs. Through comprehensive experiments in real-world robotic environments, we
show that our approach delivers significant advantages in spatial
understanding, efficiency, and stability without additional training.

Result: VLMs perform well in recognizing common objects but struggle with novel or 3D-printed object representations. Single-view and multi-view captioning trade-offs were assessed.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations of VLMs, specifically their lack of generalization to novel objects, and offers insights for their practical deployment in real-world robotic settings.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

Motivation: Existing catheter-based approaches lack the dexterity, force, and compliance required to perform intricate intracardiac procedures safely and efficiently.

Method: The authors introduced a robotic platform with a kineto-statics model, showcasing its compliance, accuracy, and ability to perform multi-anchor delivery against a motile in-vitro heart simulator.

Result: The platform demonstrated low positional error and millimeter-level accuracy in delivering anchor coils during tests against an in-vitro motile simulator.

Conclusion: The robotic platform significantly improves precision and capability in intracardiac procedures, particularly in anchor coil implantation, demonstrating its potential for safer and more efficient minimally invasive options.

Abstract: Trans-catheter cardiac intervention has become an increasingly available
option for high-risk patients without the complications of open heart surgery.
However, current catheterbased platforms suffer from a lack of dexterity, force
application, and compliance required to perform complex intracardiac
procedures. An exemplary task that would significantly ease minimally invasive
intracardiac procedures is the implantation of anchor coils, which can be used
to fix and implant various devices in the beating heart. We introduce a robotic
platform capable of delivering anchor coils. We develop a kineto-statics model
of the robotic platform and demonstrate low positional error. We leverage the
passive compliance and high force output of the actuator in a multi-anchor
delivery procedure against a motile in-vitro simulator with millimeter level
accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data across non-vision-based sensors, enabling cross-sensor data transfer and application without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of generalizable algorithms for tactile sensing across diverse sensor modalities, particularly non-optical tactile sensors.

Method: The authors developed an encoder-decoder architecture with sensor-specific encoders to create a sensor-agnostic latent space for cross-sensor tactile data transfer. Experiments were performed using two tactile sensors mounted on a robotic arm.

Result: The model successfully unified tactile data and demonstrated efficient cross-sensor data transfer and practical application, including contact geometry estimation.

Conclusion: Alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned via joint autoencoder training, allowing downstream models to be reusable across sensors without retraining, showcasing generalization abilities.

Abstract: Generalizable algorithms for tactile sensing remain underexplored, primarily
due to the diversity of sensor modalities. Recently, many methods for
cross-sensor transfer between optical (vision-based) tactile sensors have been
investigated, yet little work focus on non-optical tactile sensors. To address
this gap, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data
across non-vision-based sensors. By leveraging sensor-specific encoders, the
framework creates a latent space that is sensor-agnostic, enabling cross-sensor
data transfer with low errors and direct use in downstream applications. We
leverage this network to unify tactile data from two commercial tactile
sensors: the Xela uSkin uSPa 46 and the Contactile PapillArray. Both were
mounted on a UR5e robotic arm, performing force-controlled pressing sequences
against distinct object shapes (circular, square, and hexagonal prisms) and two
materials (rigid PLA and flexible TPU). Another more complex unseen object was
also included to investigate the model's generalization capabilities. We show
that alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned from joint autoencoder
training with matching contacts collected via different sensors. We further
demonstrate the practical utility of our approach through contact geometry
estimation, where downstream models trained on one sensor's latent
representation can be directly applied to another without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS inaccuracies caused by external factors such as urban canyons and adversarial interference pose challenges in precise navigation. The study aims to address these positional errors effectively using robotic swarms.

Method: The authors propose a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) leveraging range and bearing sensors, supplemented by Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for bias modeling. A Sparse Gaussian Process Informative Path Planning (IPP) approach further enhances data collection.

Result: Simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of SBE and IPP, with IPP showing improved performance compared to open-loop strategies in refining positional bias landscapes.

Conclusion: Combining SBE and IPP allows autonomous swarms to accurately estimate and model GPS errors, paving the way for enhanced navigation systems in challenging environments.

Abstract: External factors, including urban canyons and adversarial interference, can
lead to Global Positioning System (GPS) inaccuracies that vary as a function of
the position in the environment. This study addresses the challenge of
estimating a static, spatially-varying error function using a team of robots.
We introduce a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) whose purpose is to
estimate the GPS biases. The central idea is to use sensed estimates of the
range and bearing to the other robots in the team to estimate changes in bias
across the environment. A set of drones moves in a 2D environment, each
sampling data from GPS, range, and bearing sensors. The biases calculated by
the SBE at estimated positions are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression
(GPR) model. We use a Sparse Gaussian process-based Informative Path Planning
(IPP) algorithm that identifies high-value regions of the environment for data
collection. The swarm plans paths that maximize information gain in each
iteration, further refining their understanding of the environment's positional
bias landscape. We evaluated SBE and IPP in simulation and compared the IPP
methodology to an open-loop strategy.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for faster and more reliable human-computer interfaces for rehabilitation and prosthetics systems that work across diverse users and require minimal calibration.

Method: Authors propose a segmentation strategy with a novel masked modeling technique to assign user intent labels in real-time during gesture execution, ensuring rapid detection and stability.

Result: The proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in zero-shot transfer scenarios, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and stability for device control.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for advancing wearable robotics and prosthetics, offering improved intent detection in real-time with minimal calibration required across subjects.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals show promise for effective
human-computer interfaces, particularly in rehabilitation and prosthetics.
However, challenges remain in developing systems that respond quickly and
reliably to user intent, across different subjects and without requiring
time-consuming calibration. In this work, we propose a framework for EMG-based
intent detection that addresses these challenges. Unlike traditional gesture
recognition models that wait until a gesture is completed before classifying
it, our approach uses a segmentation strategy to assign intent labels at every
timestep as the gesture unfolds. We introduce a novel masked modeling strategy
that aligns muscle activations with their corresponding user intents, enabling
rapid onset detection and stable tracking of ongoing gestures. In evaluations
against baseline methods, considering both accuracy and stability for device
control, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
transfer conditions, demonstrating its potential for wearable robotics and
next-generation prosthetic systems. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: CronusVLA enhances vision-language-action models by enabling efficient multi-frame observation, improving manipulation task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are hindered by single-frame observations, limiting their ability to leverage motion information due to computational constraints.

Method: CronusVLA introduces a unified framework with post-training stages: single-frame pretraining, multi-frame encoding for motion feature aggregation, and cross-frame decoding via shared attention mechanisms.

Result: CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art results with a 70.9% success rate in SimplerEnv, a 12.7% performance improvement on LIBERO over OpenVLA, and robust real-world performance in robot experiments.

Conclusion: CronusVLA provides an efficient and effective approach to extending VLA models to multi-frame paradigms, enhancing manipulation task accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ManiGaussian struggle with performance in dual-arm robotic systems due to insufficient multi-body dynamics modeling, prompting the need for a more sophisticated approach.

Method: ManiGaussian++ introduces a hierarchical Gaussian world model using leader-follower architecture to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of bimanual systems through task-oriented Gaussian Splatting and future scene prediction.

Result: The approach achieves a 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on simulated tasks and a 60% average success rate in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: ManiGaussian++ sets a new benchmark in bimanual robotic manipulation by efficiently modeling multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics, improving both simulation and real-world task performance.

Abstract: Multi-task robotic bimanual manipulation is becoming increasingly popular as
it enables sophisticated tasks that require diverse dual-arm collaboration
patterns. Compared to unimanual manipulation, bimanual tasks pose challenges to
understanding the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics. An existing method
ManiGaussian pioneers encoding the spatiotemporal dynamics into the visual
representation via Gaussian world model for single-arm settings, which ignores
the interaction of multiple embodiments for dual-arm systems with significant
performance drop. In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of
ManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by
digesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world
model. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from
intermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and
stabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build
a hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture,
where the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual
representation via future scene prediction. The leader predicts Gaussian
Splatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which
the follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of
the acting arm. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art bimanual manipulation techniques by an improvement of 20.2% in
10 simulated tasks, and achieves 60% success rate on average in 9 challenging
real-world tasks. Our code is available at

### [289] [Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045)
*Ahmadreza Saboor Yaraghi,Golnaz Gharachorlu,Sakina Fatima,Lionel C. Briand,Ruiyuan Wan,Ruifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a static, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven method for fault localization in complex system test code, eliminating the need for test case execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faulty test code can often trigger system failures, yet existing methods for fault localization focus on the system-under-test rather than test code, which is equally critical. High execution costs and non-deterministic test failures further necessitate execution-free fault localization techniques.

Method: The method uses a single failure execution log to estimate execution traces through three novel pruning algorithms. These traces and error messages are used to prompt an LLM to rank potential faulty locations. The approach is black-box, requires no source code access, and supports large test scripts.

Result: The method achieved an F1 score of around 90% in matching estimated traces with actual ones and reduced LLM inference time by up to 34% without losing fault localization accuracy. Block-level localization hit rates were 81% within the top-3 ranked suggestions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for execution-free fault localization in complex system test code, providing a practical and efficient solution for narrowing the search space and retaining impactful context.

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically
relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However,
repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic
failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large
Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused
on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often
complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in
practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test
code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.
Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution
trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely
involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is
used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,
system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is
applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate
our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset
of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show
that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of
around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the
LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our
results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance,
narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81%
hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).

Method: Collected 348,840 real-world Yul smart contracts by compiling Solidity source files from the Ethereum mainnet and curated the dataset.

Result: Created YulCode, the first publicly available dataset focusing solely on Yul contracts, fostering research in machine learning, optimization, verification, and software engineering for EVM.

Conclusion: YulCode fills a critical gap and provides a resource to advance low-level contract analysis, tooling, and innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Abstract: The YulCode dataset presents a comprehensive collection of 348,840 Yul-based
smart contract instances, comprising approximately 135,013 unique contracts.
These contracts were generated through the compilation of Solidity source files
that have been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, making the dataset directly
representative of real-world decentralized applications. YulCode provides a
rich foundation for a variety of research and development tasks, including but
not limited to machine learning applications, formal verification, optimization
analysis, and software engineering tool evaluation in the context of low-level
smart contract code. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing,
YulCode is the first and only publicly available dataset that focuses
specifically on Yul, an intermediate language designed for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). As such, it fills a critical gap in the current ecosystem of
smart contract datasets and opens new avenues for research and tooling aimed at
low-level contract analysis and generation.

### [291] [Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287)
*Yaoxuan Wu,Xiaojie Zhou,Ahmad Humayun,Muhammad Ali Gulzar,Miryung Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PALM, a system combining symbolic execution and large language models for more effective test generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming limitations of symbolic execution, which struggles with complex features and constraint solvers, and large language models, which fail to systematically enumerate program paths and corner cases.

Method: PALM integrates symbolic path enumeration with LLMs by statically analyzing program paths at the AST level, transforming them into executable variants with embedded assertions, and using LLMs to generate tests. An interactive frontend visualizes path coverage.

Result: PALM avoids SMT formula translation, enabling LLMs to interpret program variants directly. A user study shows that its frontend improves users' understanding of path coverage and test exercise paths.

Conclusion: PALM effectively combines symbolic and AI-driven methods, offering a novel approach to test generation that enhances path coverage visualization and reduces analysis gaps in symbolic execution.

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering
systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it
is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code
including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability
of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex
features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test
inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths
and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting
an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In
this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic
path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates
possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an
executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This
avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead
constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the
first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage
alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they
exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend
helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are
actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and
visualization of their path profiles.

### [292] [What Makes the Best Decomposition? Investigating Binary Decomposition Under FCG Variance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19425)
*Ang Jia,He Jiang,Zhilei Ren,Xiaochen Li,Ming Fan,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the challenges of binary decomposition in the context of function call graph (FCG) variance caused by different compilation settings and proposes a method to evaluate optimal decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing binary decomposition methods that assume reused code shares similar function call relationships, despite the significant variations in FCGs caused by different compilation settings and function inlining decisions.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical study using a dataset compiled with 17 compilers, 6 optimizations, and 4 architectures. They analyze FCG changes and mappings, evaluate existing binary decomposition methods against FCG variances, and propose a method to identify optimal decomposition.

Result: The study finds dramatic changes in FCG size under different compilation settings but identifies three types of mappings that link FCGs. Existing decomposition methods face significant challenges under cross-compiler evaluations and diverse optimization settings.

Conclusion: Current binary decomposition methods are inadequate for handling FCG variance across compilation settings, suffering from low coverage or unstable community similarities. The proposed evaluation for optimal decomposition highlights these deficiencies.

Abstract: Binary decomposition, which decomposes binary files into modules, plays a
critical role in binary reuse detection. Existing binary decomposition works
either apply anchor-based methods by extending anchor functions to generate
modules, or apply clustering-based methods by using clustering algorithms to
group binary functions, which all rely on that reused code shares similar
function call relationships. However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs)
vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse
function inlining decisions.
  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance
of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on
binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17
compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and
mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while
the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we
evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that
existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler
evaluation with diverse optimization settings. Finally, we propose a method to
identify the optimal decomposition and compare the existing decomposition works
with the optimal decomposition. Existing works either suffer from low coverage
or cannot generate stable community similarities.

*Shahbaz Siddeeq,Muhammad Waseem,Zeeshan Rasheed,Md Mahade Hasan,Jussi Rasku,Mika Saari,Henri Terho,Kalle Makela,Kai-Kristian Kemell,Pekka Abrahamsson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LLM-based multi-agent system for automating Haskell code refactoring, demonstrating significant improvements in code quality, efficiency, and complexity reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the labor-intensive nature of software refactoring, especially in functional programming like Haskell, by leveraging LLMs for automation.

Method: A multi-agent system with specialized roles—code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging—was developed using LLMs and tested on open-source Haskell codebases.

Result: Experiments showed a 22.46% improvement in code quality, a 13.27% improvement in performance efficiency, and up to a 14.57% memory allocation optimization on average.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems are highly effective in automating structured, semantically accurate refactoring for functional programming, improving maintainability and fostering automated workflows.

Abstract: Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance.
Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However,
this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze
the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we
put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate
the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to
evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and
semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent
system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code
analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the
effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we
conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The
results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based
multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an
improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance
efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was
optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based
multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional
programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems
integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can
enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Pair programming (PP) adoption in software teams is influenced by various factors such as perceptions, attitudes, resources, and task characteristics. Tailoring PP to specific teams enhances engagement and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why pair programming adoption is inconsistent despite its benefits in knowledge sharing and collaboration, especially in complex software systems.

Method: Conducted an exploratory single-case study at an agile company in Norway, using two rounds of interviews and thematic analysis of responses.

Result: Discovered factors affecting PP engagement, including perceptions of its benefits, required efforts, attitudes of company/team, resource availability, infrastructure, and task demands.

Conclusion: For sustained PP engagement, perceived benefits must match firsthand experiences, and the practice should be adapted based on collective learning within individual teams.

Abstract: Context: Pair programming (PP) is more relevant than ever. As modern systems
grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have
become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption
remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to
understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well
as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory
single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data
through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and
performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is
that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to
daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team
attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP
engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits
with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the
practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is
also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners
seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.

*Julian Fragner,Christian Macho,Bernhard Dieber,Martin Pinzger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reptile, a tool to automate the conversion of regular expressions (RegExes) into Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL) patterns, optimizing them using GPT-4. It achieves high success rates and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Migrating log analytics tools often requires manual and error-prone conversion of RegExes into domain-specific languages like DPL.

Method: Reptile combines a rule-based conversion approach, a best-effort fallback mechanism, and GPT-4 integration for optimizing converted DPL patterns.

Result: Reptile successfully converted 73.7% of 946 RegExes and achieved F1-score and MCC above 0.91 in optimizing patterns, demonstrating high efficacy.

Conclusion: Reptile streamlines migration to modern log analytics platforms, reducing costs and errors, with promising practical implications for enterprise software systems.

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

### [296] [Simulating the Waterfall Model: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19653)
*Antonios Saravanos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper identifies how the Waterfall Model has been represented in computational simulations within academia from 2000 to 2024, revealing trends, methodologies, and gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and highlight the underexplored area of how the Waterfall Model is simulated in academic research, especially in light of its hybrid use with Agile methodologies.

Method: Systematic mapping study applied to 68 peer-reviewed works, categorizing them based on simulation techniques, tools, geographic/temporal trends, and adherence to Royce's original seven-phase model.

Result: Discrete-event simulation prevailed due to the model’s sequential nature. Older studies favored proprietary platforms, while newer studies utilized open-source Python tools. None fully adhered to Royce's original model.

Conclusion: Simulation of the Waterfall Model exists in academia but remains niche. The study calls for accessible tools and urges future integration of waterfall practices in modern hybrid models.

Abstract: This systematic mapping study examines how the Waterfall Model has been
represented in computational simulations within peer-reviewed literature. While
Agile methodologies dominate contemporary software design practices, the
Waterfall Model persists, particularly, within hybrid approaches that fuse
structured, sequential workflows with the adaptability of agile practices.
Despite its continued presence, little attention has been given to how the
Waterfall Model is simulated in research contexts. A structured search of major
academic databases identified 68 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000
and 2024. After applying inclusion criteria, selected studies were analyzed
across four dimensions: (1) simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete-event
simulation, system dynamics), (2) platforms and tools (e.g., Simphony.NET,
SimPy), (3) geographic and temporal trends, and (4) fidelity to Royce's
original seven-phase model. Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used,
reflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary
platforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based
tools. No studies fully implemented Royce's original formulation, most employed
adaptations. These findings suggest that although niche, simulation of the
Waterfall Model is present in academic discourse. This work highlights the need
for accessible modeling tools and calls for future research that integrates the
waterfall software process model with modern hybrid practices.

*Shi Chang,Boyuan Chen,Kishanthan Thangarajah,Hanan Lutfiyya,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes SABER, a dynamic batching strategy for CodeLLMs, addressing SLA violations and performance instability caused by static batch sizes in LLM serving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently serving CodeLLMs in resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to fluctuating request rates and heterogeneous workloads, leading to SLA violations.

Method: SABER employs a dynamic batching mechanism that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and makes real-time adjustments to improve performance.

Result: SABER enhances throughput (goodput) by up to 26%, reduces latency variability by up to 45%, and operates without requiring manual tuning or service restarts.

Conclusion: SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is crucial for achieving robust and high-performance CodeLLM serving in modern software workflows.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly integrated into modern
software development workflows, yet efficiently serving them in
resource-constrained, self-hosted environments remains a significant challenge.
Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput
improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot
adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to
frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In
this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts
per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves
goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency
variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our
results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust,
high-performance CodeLLM serving.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies and evaluates key developer experience (DX) factors influencing third-party developers' adoption and engagement in software ecosystem (SECO) platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of clarity on the most influential factors affecting DX in SECO platforms, which impacts developers' sustained engagement and interest.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) involving 29 studies and a Delphi study with 21 third-party developers to evaluate 27 DX factors.

Result: Key influencing factors identified include financial costs, desired technical resources, low entry barriers to the application market, and potential financial gains.

Conclusion: Developer experience is critical for SECO success. The findings provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners to address DX challenges effectively.

Abstract: Context: Developer experience (DX) plays a key role in developers'
performance and their continued involvement in a software ecosystem (SECO)
platform. While researchers and practitioners have recognized several factors
affecting DX in SECO platforms, a clear roadmap of the most influential factors
is still missing. This is particularly important given the direct impact on
developers' interest in SECO and their ongoing engagement with the common
technological platform. Goal: This work aims to identify key DX factors and
understand how they influence third-party developers' decisions to adopt and
keep contributing to a SECO. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping study
(SMS), analyzing 29 studies to assess the state-of-the-art of DX in SECO.
Additionally, we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the influence of 27 DX
factors (identified in our SMS) from the perspective of 21 third-party
developers to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO. Results: The factors that
most strongly influence developers' adoption and ongoing contributions to a
SECO are: financial costs for using the platform, desired technical resources
for development, low barriers to entry into the applications market, and more
financial gains. Conclusion: DX is essential for the success and sustainability
of SECO. Our set of DX factors provides valuable insights and recommendations
for researchers and practitioners to address key DX concerns from the
perspective of third-party developers.

*Siyang Song,Yupeng Huo,Shiqing Tang,Jiaee Cheong,Rui Gao,Michel Valstar,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Depression assessment currently faces challenges such as subjectivity and lack of efficiency. This paper reviews machine learning techniques for automatic depression assessment using multi-modal human behaviors, discussions on datasets, challenges, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for depression diagnosis face issues like subjectivity, delays, costs, and workforce shortages. Machine learning offers potential solutions, but no comprehensive review exists exploring multi-modal behavior analysis.

Method: The paper surveys machine learning-based automatic depression assessment techniques that analyze depression cues from various human behaviors, comparing features, limitations, and summarizing existing datasets and competitions.

Result: The study provides a detailed summary of depression-related human behaviors across multiple modalities, evaluates ADA techniques, discusses limitations, and identifies research gaps.

Conclusion: The paper bridges critical gaps in ADA research by offering an in-depth review and proposing directions for future studies, emphasizing the need for multi-modal analysis and addressing existing challenges.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formalism for machine consciousness using set theory, inspired by theories of human consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of machine consciousness by drawing from neuroscientific theories and formalizing them.

Method: The authors develop a set-theoretic model based on the local percept-perceiver paradigm and use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to analyze it.

Result: The possibility of epistemic consciousness within machines is proved mathematically using the presented model.

Conclusion: The study establishes a reductionist and theoretical foundation for understanding consciousness in artificial systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm of the local percept-perceiver
phenomenon to formalize certain observations in neuroscientific theories of
consciousness. Using this model, a set-theoretic formalism is developed for
artificial systems, and the existence of machine consciousness is proved by
invoking Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The article argues for the possibility of
a reductionist form of epistemic consciousness within machines.

*Megan A. K. Peters,Hojjat Azimi Asrari*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses higher-order representations (HORs), their role in metacognition and consciousness, and proposes a Bayesian perspective to understand their construction and neural basis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of the dimensionality, construction, and neural substrates of HORs critical to metacognition and learning.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian framework, examining 'posterior-like' HORs as combinations of 'likelihood-like' FOR uncertainty estimates and 'prior-like' learned distributions.

Result: The analysis explains how HORs contribute to metacognitive uncertainty by integrating different probabilistic processes.

Conclusion: The work highlights emerging engineering and analytical methods to explore neural correlates and processes underpinning HORs, expanding knowledge in metacognition.

Abstract: Higher-order representations (HORs) are neural or computational states that
are "about" first-order representations (FORs), encoding information not about
the external world per se but about the agent's own representational processes
-- such as the reliability, source, or structure of a FOR. These HORs appear
critical to metacognition, learning, and even consciousness by some accounts,
yet their dimensionality, construction, and neural substrates remain poorly
understood. Here, we propose that metacognitive estimates of uncertainty or
noise reflect a read-out of "posterior-like" HORs from a Bayesian perspective.
We then discuss how these posterior-like HORs reflect a combination of
"likelihood-like" estimates of current FOR uncertainty and "prior-like" learned
distributions over expected FOR uncertainty, and how various emerging
engineering and theory-based analytical approaches may be employed to examine
the estimation processes and neural correlates associated with these highly
under-explored components of our experienced uncertainty.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: MR-LFADS is a new model introduced to improve understanding of brain-region communication by addressing limitations in existing methods through disentangling influences on neural populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advancements in neural recording technologies allow simultaneous recording across multiple brain regions, necessitating models that can effectively depict neural communication.

Method: MR-LFADS employs a sequential variational autoencoder to separate inter-regional communication, contributions from unobserved regions, and local neural dynamics.

Result: MR-LFADS demonstrates superior performance in simulations and real electrophysiology data, effectively identifying communication networks and predicting brain-wide effects of perturbations.

Conclusion: MR-LFADS serves as a potent framework for discovering principles behind brain-wide information processing, validated through synthetic and real-world neural data.

Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population
activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven
models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can
struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations,
leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we
introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS),
a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional
communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population
dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying
communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region
networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts
brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model
fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS
as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information
processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how subjective experiences and lifestyle choices correlate with objective biometric data and identify potential health/well-being interventions.

Method: Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative correlation analysis of HRV data and subjective tags with qualitative analysis of daily logs.

Result: The study aims to uncover insights on the impacts of lifestyle choices and thinking patterns on biometric outputs.

Conclusion: Findings may guide personalized interventions for mental health and well-being using wearable technologies.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between lifestyle
choices, subjective experiences and objective biometric data in a single
individual. The participant, at the time a male in his twenties, used the
EliteHRV app to perform Heart Rate Variability Readings across twenty-six
months accompanied by logs about the previous days activity as well as current
emotional and physical state. The study will use a mixed-methods approach to
analyze the data, including quantitative analysis of the biometric data and
correlation analysis between the biometric data and subjective experience tags.
Qualitative analysis of the daily logs will also be conducted to gain a deeper
understanding of the participant's experiences and to identify keywords,
people, or ideas that affect biometric output. The results of this study will
provide insights into the relationship between subjective and objective
measures, and the potential benefits or drawbacks of certain lifestyle choices
and ways of thinking. The findings could have implications for the development
of wearable-based personalized interventions for improving mental health and
well-being.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates differences in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) between macaques and humans using advanced imaging and tracing techniques, linking human-specific AF expansions to language evolution and related disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the anatomical and connectivity differences of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates and humans, and to explore their relevance to the evolution of advanced human language networks.

Method: The study used cross-scale single-neuron tracing (via viral-based labeling and fluorescence micro-optical tomography) in macaques, whole-brain tractography with 11.7T diffusion MRI, and spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans for a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF.

Result: The macaque's AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex and extends to prefrontal regions, while the human AF shows expanded connections to the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum linkages. These species differences in connectivity were quantified using Kullback-Leibler analysis.

Conclusion: The observed differences in AF connectivity offer insights into the evolutionary adaptations supporting human language processing and provide a framework for understanding AF-related disorders like aphasia and dyslexia.

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Motivation: To streamline the CCT and potentially reduce participant load by determining whether all 12 steps are necessary to gather accurate data on contagious beliefs.

Method: The study analyzed variance across 12 CCT steps to determine at which point no additional variance between participants was explained. Previous findings with real and virtual stimuli for CCT were also referenced.

Result: After 8 steps in the CCT, minimal new variance is explained, and no further information is gained after step 10. This suggests the task can effectively measure beliefs with fewer steps.

Conclusion: Using 8 pens in the CCT is recommended to maintain efficiency and retain measurement validity.

Abstract: The chain of contagion task (CCT) is a pychological test to measure the
amount of contagious beliefs in individuals. Contagious beliefs thereby refer
to the perception that certain objects, people, or substances can transmit
contamination through mere contact or proximity (Rozin et al., 1986). In the
CCT, a neutral object (usually a pen) is rubbed against an inherently
disgusting object (e.g. a toilet paper with feces) and participants are asked
how contaminated this pen is on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very
contaminated). Afterwards, this pen is rubbed against another pen, and again,
the experienced degree of contamination is assessed. This is repeated 12 times.
The CCT has first been experimentally investigated by Tolin et al. (2004) in an
in vivo procedure with real disgusting objects. The authors could show that
contagious beliefs measured with the CCT show a strong bias for people with
contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (C-OCD) compared to anxious
individuals and non-anxious controls. Fink-Lamotte et al. (2024) replicated
these findings with an online version of the CCT using audio-imagery-based and
video-based stimuli and instructions. Both studies used 12 pens to assess the
degree of contagious beliefs. Within this brief report, we show that after 8
pens, hardly any additional variance is explained between participants and
after the tenth pen, no new information is gained. Thus, we recommend only
using 8 pens instead of 12 when using the CCT to assess contagious beliefs.

### [306] [The time course of visuo-semantic representations in the human brain is captured by combining vision and language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19497)
*Boyan Rong,Alessandro Thomas Gifford,Emrah Düzel,Radoslaw Martin Cichy*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study combines vision DNNs, LLMs, and EEG data to model visuo-semantic processing in the brain, with fusion models outperforming standalone approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how the human brain processes visuo-semantic information by integrating insights from vision DNNs and LLMs.

Method: The authors used EEG data from object image viewing and built encoding models to predict responses using vision DNN and LLM representations, evaluating fusion and standalone approaches.

Result: Fusion models outperform individual vision DNNs and LLMs, revealing complementary roles in the brain's visual processing, with vision DNNs focusing on early signals and LLMs capturing later semantic signals.

Conclusion: Combining vision DNNs and LLMs enhances modeling of visuo-semantic brain processes, offering a clearer temporal understanding of neural responses to visual stimuli.

Abstract: The human visual system provides us with a rich and meaningful percept of the
world, transforming retinal signals into visuo-semantic representations. For a
model of these representations, here we leveraged a combination of two
currently dominating approaches: vision deep neural networks (DNNs) and large
language models (LLMs). Using large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG)
data recorded during object image viewing, we built encoding models to predict
EEG responses using representations from a vision DNN, an LLM, and their
fusion. We show that the fusion encoding model outperforms encoding models
based on either the vision DNN or the LLM alone, as well as previous modelling
approaches, in predicting neural responses to visual stimulation. The vision
DNN and the LLM complemented each other in explaining stimulus-related signal
in the EEG responses. The vision DNN uniquely captured earlier and broadband
EEG signals, whereas the LLM uniquely captured later and low frequency signals,
as well as detailed visuo-semantic stimulus information. Together, this
provides a more accurate model of the time course of visuo-semantic processing
in the human brain.

### [307] [Modeling the influences of non-local connectomic projections on geometrically constrained cortical dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19800)
*Rishikesan Maran,Eli J. Müller,Ben D. Fulcher*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical model to study the interplay between cortical geometry and fast axonal projections in shaping macroscale brain activity. Local geometry captures slower spontaneous dynamics, while fast projections influence rapid responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why macroscale cortical dynamics can be effectively described by local geometry despite fast, non-local projections playing a significant role in brain activity.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical model incorporating both continuous sheet dynamics and Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections (FNPs) to simulate brain activity under varying dynamics and timescales.

Result: The model showed that FNPs greatly influence rapid stimulus-evoked brain activity (<30 ms), but have little impact on slower spontaneous fluctuations (>30 ms), where local geometry dominates.

Conclusion: Local cortical geometry is sufficient for describing slower macroscale brain dynamics, but FNPs are essential for accurately capturing rapid communication, suggesting distinct roles based on context and timescale.

Abstract: The function and dynamics of the cortex are fundamentally shaped by the
specific wiring configurations of its constituent axonal fibers, also known as
the connectome. However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical
activity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating
waves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's
two-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local
geometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics,
despite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections
(FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of
activity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by
developing a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which
cortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional
set of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the
model across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales,
we demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of
rapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\lessapprox
30~\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous
fluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\text{ms}$), which increasingly
resemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest
that the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local
(geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are
context-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture
rapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid
processing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping
slower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging).

*Soojin Park,Suyeon Kang,Chioun Lee*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to address confounding risk in causal decomposition analysis when assessing risk factors and social disparities by extending sensitivity analysis and proposing a bounding strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve causal decomposition analysis, enabling robust consideration of omitted confounding and broaden its applicability with binary risk factors to assess social disparities.

Method: It develops an advanced simulation-based sensitivity analysis to handle unmeasured confounders and proposes a benchmarking strategy to quantify omitted confounding for binary risk factors.

Result: The authors demonstrate their methods using real-world data, specifically the High School Longitudinal Study 2009, addressing biases in deriving optimal treatment regimes and estimating individualized effects.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the precision and reliability of causal decomposition analysis by tackling omitted confounders, providing significant tools to deepen social disparities research.

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

### [309] [When Diffusion Models Memorize: Inductive Biases in Probability Flow of Minimum-Norm Shallow Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19031)
*Chen Zeno,Hila Manor,Greg Ongie,Nir Weinberger,Tomer Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes diffusion models' probability flow dynamics and its convergence properties, exploring simplified cases to understand when the process memorizes training samples or generates novel manifold points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding of when diffusion models' probability flow converges to training data or points on the data manifold.

Method: The study evaluates a shallow ReLU neural network denoiser with minimal l2 norm and simplifies the probability flow dynamics using score flow for orthogonal datasets, extending results to other configurations like obtuse simplex data.

Result: The results show that diffusion probability flow converges to either a training point, a sum of training points, or a manifold point, with reduced memorization as training dataset size increases.

Conclusion: Diffusion models exhibit both memorization and generalization. Early stopping, larger datasets, and simplified model setups can help understand and mitigate memorization behavior in these models.

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

*Kyeongwon Lee,Lizhen Lin,Jaewoo Park,Seonghyun Jeong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proves sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal posterior contraction rates for complex function spaces, enabling effectiveness in high-dimensional problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high-dimensional structured estimation and the curse of dimensionality by leveraging intrinsic properties of functional spaces.

Method: Analyzed sparse Bayesian neural networks using shrinkage priors to derive optimal contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and hierarchical compositions.

Result: Sparse Bayesian neural networks with shrinkage priors achieve optimal contraction rates aligned with intrinsic dimensionality and adapt to unknown smoothness levels.

Conclusion: Sparse Bayesian neural networks offer theoretical robustness and practical adaptability in structured, high-dimensional estimation tasks.

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

### [311] [Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19276)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) algorithmic hardness through local entropy (LE), linking it to the computational gap where efficient solvers cease to function due to structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the root cause of the computational paradox in ABP where efficient algorithms exist near, but not at, high constraint densities.

Method: The study employs lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) and large deviation upgrade (sfl LD RDT) to analyze typical and atypical features of ABP through local entropy breakdown.

Result: The LE breakdown occurs at certain constraint density levels ($\alpha \in (0.77, 0.78)$), correlating with the performance limits of state-of-the-art ABP solvers.

Conclusion: Local entropy may serve as a key indicator of computational gaps in ABP and contributes to understanding the structural hardness behind algorithmic limitations.

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

*Sjoerd Dirksen,Patrick Finke,Paul Geuchen,Dominik Stöger,Felix Voigtlaender*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks with random parameters, providing bounds for various $p$ values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants in random ReLU networks with wide configurations and varying depths.

Method: The paper derives high-probability upper and lower bounds for the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants, considering shallow and deep networks and exploring their behavior in different $p$ regimes.

Result: The bounds for the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants vary between $p \in [1,2)$ and $p \in [2,\infty]$. Specifically, for $p \in [2,\infty]$, the constant behaves like $\Vert g \Vert_{p'}$, while for $p \in [1,2)$, it resembles $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Conclusion: The behavior of $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants in ReLU networks depends significantly on the $p$ regime, revealing insights into the structural properties of random neural networks.

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

TL;DR: This study evaluates SAX, enhanced SAX (eSAX), and TDA to cluster time-series data from Google Trends, highlighting TDA's strength in handling complexity and volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better cluster and interpret noisy, high-dimensional Google Trends data for real-time marketing and trend forecasting.

Method: Three clustering approaches—SAX, eSAX, and Topological Data Analysis (TDA)—are applied to analyze 20 keywords from Google Trends.

Result: SAX and eSAX excel in clustering stable time series but struggle with volatile data, while TDA captures global structural features and forms more balanced clusters.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches integrating symbolic (eSAX) and topological (TDA) methods hold promise for consumer analytics and clustering complex datasets effectively.

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

*Susovan Pal,Praneeth Vepakomma*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the convergence properties of the Mean Shift algorithm, generalizing results for radially symmetric, strictly positive kernels with large bandwidth using different assumptions and proof techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve a rigorous understanding of Mean Shift convergence for general kernel profiles, filling gaps left by prior studies.

Method: The authors employ alternate kernel characterizations and proof techniques influenced by earlier convergence results.

Result: Proved that Mean Shift converges for large bandwidths in any dimension with radially symmetric, strictly positive definite smooth kernels.

Conclusion: The results extend prior knowledge but remain more restrictive than recent findings due to bandwidth constraints, relying on different assumptions and proof approaches.

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The study develops an infrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework for UAVs using onboard UWB sensors, drawing inspiration from animal swarm behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexities of relative localization in 3D scenarios for UAVs, enabling precise position detection for unmanned vehicles without external infrastructure.

Method: The paper introduces two localization algorithms (EDM and MLE), analyzes theoretical bounds (CRLB and GDOP), and conducts simulation studies, field tests, and performance comparisons.

Result: The developed framework accurately performs 3D near-field localization, showcasing generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and strong applicability through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel and efficient 3D localization framework, with potential applications for a collaborative UxV system using minimal sensor deployment.

Abstract: Relative localization in the near-field scenario is critically important for
unmanned vehicle (UxV) applications. Although related works addressing 2D
relative localization problem have been widely studied for unmanned ground
vehicles (UGVs), the problem in 3D scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) involves more uncertainties and remains to be investigated. Inspired by
the phenomenon that animals can achieve swarm behaviors solely based on
individual perception of relative information, this study proposes an
infrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework that relies exclusively
on onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. Leveraging 2D relative positioning
research, we conducted feasibility analysis, system modeling, simulations,
performance evaluation, and field tests using UWB sensors. The key
contributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios;
development of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance
matrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);
comprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis
against state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a
novel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling
single-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV
applications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate
strong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with
significant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on power electronics demands faster and more accurate time-domain simulations, highlighting limitations in current physics-based commercial tools and opportunities for data-driven approaches.

Method: A physics-informed BiLSTM model is proposed and compared against a physics-informed FCNN and a standard BiLSTM using step-response tests for evaluating accuracy and consistency in simulation.

Result: The BiLSTM-PINN model demonstrated over 9 times better performance in median RMSE compared to the FCNN and was more consistent, showing major potential improvements in simulation.

Conclusion: The BiLSTM-PINN model is a promising alternative for power electronics simulations, offering enhanced accuracy and consistency over existing methods.

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper examines the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to model stealing attacks, proposing a two-step approach called QueryWise to enhance the attack under realistic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging are increasingly used for diagnostics, but their proprietary nature makes them targets for theft through model stealing attacks.

Method: The authors explored how adversaries perform model stealing attacks on medical imaging models using publicly available datasets. They introduced QueryWise, a two-step approach leveraging unlabeled proxy data to train the thief model with minimal querying.

Result: The proposed QueryWise approach succeeded in effectively cloning the functionality of medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification, even with limited query budgets.

Conclusion: Medical imaging models are highly vulnerable to model stealing attacks under realistic conditions, emphasizing the need for better defenses. QueryWise proves that stealing models is feasible with publicly available datasets and limited queries.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces a noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) to enhance dental radiographs with improved fine detail reconstruction, outperforming existing methods like Uformer and MResDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional convolutional denoising autoencoders recover low-frequency features better than high-frequency details, causing a loss of fine details, which is problematic for dental radiographs needing preserved anatomical structures.

Method: The authors developed a noise-aware self-attention method that focuses on recovering important high-frequency features within noisy regions, integrated into the NAADA network for panoramic dental radiograph enhancement.

Result: The proposed NAADA method outperforms recent state-of-the-art and heavier models (e.g., Uformer, MResDNN) by better reconstructing fine details and improving diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: NAADA is an effective, attention-focused network that addresses noise challenges to deliver high-quality image restoration with fine detail preservation, especially useful in dental radiograph diagnostics.

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

Conclusion: NIC-RobustBench is a critical contribution to the field, enabling thorough assessment of NIC methods' robustness and efficiency in adversarial contexts.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper
demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and
employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at

### [320] [Xray2Xray: World Model from Chest X-rays with Volumetric Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19055)
*Zefan Yang,Xinrui Song,Xuanang Xu,Yongyi Shi,Ge Wang,Mannudeep K. Kalra,Pingkun Yan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Xray2Xray, a new model to overcome limitations of chest X-rays, by learning 3D structural information from 2D projections for improved disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D chest X-rays are limited by structural superposition, which hampers precision in disease diagnosis and risk prediction.

Method: The authors introduce Xray2Xray, a World Model that learns 3D latent representations of chest volumes using a vision model and a transition model to model transition dynamics across X-ray angles.

Result: Xray2Xray outperformed supervised and self-supervised methods in cardiovascular risk estimation and achieved competitive results in pathology classification in CXRs.

Conclusion: Xray2Xray successfully overcomes the limitations of 2D CXRs by learning meaningful 3D latent representations, enhancing diagnostic precision and image reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

*Umair Khan,Jouni Härkönen,Marjukka Friman,Leena Latonen,Teijo Kuopio,Pekka Ruusuvuori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores mitigating stain variations in H&E tissue images, a challenge for AI and pathologist analysis, using a multi-center dataset and comparing eight stain normalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of significant stain variability in H&E-stained tissue specimens across laboratories, which hampers consistent analysis by pathologists and AI models.

Method: The authors created a unique multi-center dataset with tissue samples sent to 66 labs under controlled conditions, then systematically compared eight stain normalization methods (traditional and deep learning-based).

Result: Results showed the comparative strengths and weaknesses of normalization techniques using quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings suggest that reducing staining variation and improving model generalizability can be achieved by leveraging varied training data and effective normalization methods.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

### [322] [A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19167)
*Benjamin Graham*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based model for fast image registration in cardiac imaging, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in current image registration methods for cardiac kinematics, which are either time-consuming or inaccurate for dynamic organs.

Method: A fast, volumetric registration Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) called FLIR is proposed, enabling efficient convolution computation and maintaining accuracy.

Result: The FLIR model demonstrates registration fidelity on par with state-of-the-art models and produces consistent strain values across patient acquisitions.

Conclusion: The FLIR model offers an efficient and accurate solution for cardiac strain quantification, suitable for broader research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

### [323] [Deformable Medical Image Registration with Effective Anatomical Structure Representation and Divide-and-Conquer Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19222)
*Xinke Ma,Yongsheng Pan,Qingjie Zeng,Mengkang Lu,Bolysbek Murat Yerzhanuly,Bazargul Matkerim,Yong Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EASR-DCN, a novel method for deformable medical image registration (DMIR) that utilizes ROI representation and independent alignment to improve upon existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based DMIR methods fail to effectively represent ROIs and provide independent alignment, either overlooking ROI representation (unsupervised techniques) or overly relying on labels (weakly-supervised techniques).

Method: The authors employ a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to define multiple ROIs, followed by a Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process each ROI independently. These are then combined into a displacement vector field for comprehensive alignment.

Result: EASR-DCN demonstrated superior performance across three MRI and one CT datasets, significantly improving the Dice score over VoxelMorph: 10.31% (brain MRI), 13.01% (cardiac MRI), and 5.75% (hippocampus MRI).

Conclusion: EASR-DCN effectively enhances DMIR by leveraging ROI representation and independent alignment, showing strong potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks over 20 anomaly detection methods on five digital pathology datasets, analyzing their performance and limitations for handling unique challenges like large image sizes and stain variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges unique to anomaly detection in digital pathology, such as large image sizes, multi-scale structures, and stain variability, where current methods struggle.

Method: Extensively benchmarked over 20 anomaly detection methods using five real and synthetic digital pathology datasets, evaluating factors like image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies.

Result: Provided a comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each anomaly detection method, highlighting performance variations based on key influencing factors.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a foundation for guiding future research and method development in anomaly detection for digital pathology.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

### [325] [Explicit Residual-Based Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19297)
*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on scalable image compression methods that serve both human and machine vision. Two new methods, FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH, are proposed to enhance coding efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of images by both humans and machine recognition models has created the need for scalable compression techniques tailored for both applications.

Method: The paper introduces FR-ICMH (Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding) and PR-ICMH (Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding), leveraging explicit residual compression mechanisms for better efficiency and interpretability.

Result: Experimental results showcase the efficacy of PR-ICMH with up to 29.57% BD-rate savings compared to prior models.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are effective, flexible, and improve coding efficiency, making them adaptable to various image-based tasks and requirements.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

### [326] [Reconsidering Explicit Longitudinal Mammography Alignment for Enhanced Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19363)
*Solveig Thrun,Stine Hansen,Zijun Sun,Nele Blum,Suaiba A. Salahuddin,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Elisabeth Wetzer,Robert Jenssen,Maik Stille,Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study evaluates methods for aligning mammograms over time to improve breast cancer risk prediction, showing that image-level alignment outperforms representation-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing methods for temporal alignment in mammograms to better track breast tissue changes and improve risk predictions for breast cancer.

Method: The authors compare explicit alignment techniques in both input and representation spaces, exploring whether joint optimization of alignment and risk prediction enhances performance.

Result: The study finds that image-level alignment delivers superior deformation field quality and achieves higher accuracy in risk prediction compared to representation-level alignment.

Conclusion: Image-level alignment is recommended for mammogram-based risk prediction as it balances better alignment and predictive performance, improving the overall efficacy of breast cancer screening.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

### [327] [Angio-Diff: Learning a Self-Supervised Adversarial Diffusion Model for Angiographic Geometry Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19455)
*Zhifeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Xin Wen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu,Kunlun He*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method using diffusion models, termed Angio-Diff, to efficiently transform non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, addressing challenges in vascular image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for modality translation from non-angiographic X-rays to angiographic X-rays to reduce radiation exposure, but this is limited by a lack of paired datasets and challenges with maintaining vascular geometry during synthesis.

Method: The proposed solution includes a self-supervised diffusion model that learns vascular data distribution, a generator for vessel synthesis, a mask-based adversarial module, and a parametric vascular model to improve geometric accuracy.

Result: The method demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality through superior vessel structure synthesis. Additionally, a pipeline and a synthetic dataset were developed.

Conclusion: The Angio-Diff method successfully addresses limitations in vascular image synthesis, enhancing the realism and geometric accuracy of synthetic angiographic images, thereby mitigating data shortages.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is
available at https://github.com/zfw-cv/AngioDiff.

### [328] [Learning from Anatomy: Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for Improved Metastatic Bone Disease Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19590)
*Joris Wuts,Jakub Ceranka,Nicolas Michoux,Frédéric Lecouvet,Jef Vandemeulebroucke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method that uses MRI-based skeletal segmentation to improve metastatic bone disease (MBD) segmentation in WB-MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is difficult due to lesion variability, ambiguous boundaries, severe class imbalance, and the need for large annotated datasets, which are resource-intensive to create.

Method: The SAP method involves pretraining a skeletal segmentation model on WB-MRI scans of healthy individuals, followed by its use in MBD segmentation on MRI scans from 44 metastatic prostate cancer patients. Results are compared against random initialization and SSL methods.

Result: SAP outperformed baselines in Dice coefficients, normalized surface Dice, F2 score for lesion detection, and achieved 100% detection sensitivity for clinically relevant lesions larger than 1 ml in 28 of 32 patients.

Conclusion: The proposed SAP method effectively leverages bone morphology learning, offering a domain-relevant inductive bias for accurate MBD segmentation. The code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

*Klara Leffler,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Samuel Kuttner,Karin Söderkvist,Jan Axelsson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a deep learning model to fill in missing data in sinograms for sparse PET scanner configurations, enabling cost-effective designs while somewhat compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing cost-effective total body PET scanners with extended field-of-view is critical as traditional designs with densely packed photodetectors are financially prohibitive.

Method: The paper uses a modified Residual U-Net deep learning model trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR that simulates sparse detector configurations with 50% of detectors removed in a chessboard pattern.

Result: The proposed method effectively recovers missing sinogram data with a low mean absolute error (<2 events per pixel), outperforming 2D interpolation. However, reconstructed images lack sharpness in finer details due to a smoothing effect.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that deep learning can effectively compensate for undersampling in sparse PET designs, offering a potential pathway to more cost-effective PET scanners for broader clinical use.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

*Ahmad Mustafa,Reza Rastegar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops a hybrid AI-driven approach for segmenting the prostate gland from T2-weighted MRI, addressing both data limitations and inter-slice context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate segmentation in MRI is essential for cancer diagnosis but challenging due to inter-slice continuity issues and limited annotated data.

Method: The paper introduces a model combining DeepLabV3 for semantic feature extraction and ConvLSTM layers for spatiotemporal integration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in segmentation metrics such as IoU and DSC, under both standard and noisy imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework offers a robust solution for context-aware prostate gland segmentation, even in challenging clinical settings.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

*Zhuowei Xu,Han Li,Dai Sun,Zhicheng Li,Yujia Li,Qingpeng Kong,Zhiwei Cheng,Nassir Navab,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses CBCT reconstruction challenges using NeRF-based methods and introduces normalization strategies for enhancing hash encoder feature consistency and network initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT reconstruction suffers from artifacts due to limited X-ray projections, and existing NeRF-based methods face optimization mismatches between hash encoders and neural networks.

Method: The paper proposes a Normalized Hash Encoder to ensure feature consistency and a Mapping Consistency Initialization (MCI) strategy to improve neural network stability during early training.

Result: The approach improves training efficiency and reconstruction quality, validated on 128 CT cases from diverse datasets and anatomical regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, effective, and significantly enhances training stability, convergence speed, and reconstruction performance in CBCT.

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

*Mubaraq Yakubu,Navodini Wijethilake,Jonathan Shapey,Andrew King,Alexander Hammers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods in MRI for pituitary gland and adenoma segmentation, reporting variable Dice scores depending on the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of pituitary adenomas and the gland itself, which are critical for their diagnosis and treatment.

Method: The study reviews 34 studies, analyzing the segmentation techniques employed and their performance metrics, such as Dice overlap scores.

Result: Deep learning, especially U-Net-based models, is widely used, with Dice scores ranging from 0.19–89.00% for pituitary glands and 4.60–96.41% for adenomas for automatic methods. Semi-automatic methods show somewhat more consistent performance.

Conclusion: U-Net models demonstrate potential, particularly for adenoma segmentation, but further advancements using diverse datasets and considering factors like age, adenoma size, and MR field strength are necessary for clinical application.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

### [333] [Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Sequential Auctions under Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19038)
*Vincent Leon,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper addresses online sequential auctions in unknown, evolving markets by extending the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to a dynamic setting and proposing a reinforcement learning-based method to approximate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in modeling sequential auctions where market conditions evolve over time without resetting, and to ensure efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality in this dynamic context.

Method: Developed a dynamic version of the VCG mechanism for sequential auctions and proposed an online reinforcement learning algorithm to approximate it effectively in unknown market conditions.

Result: The online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that is approximately efficient, truthful, and individually rational while minimizing regret.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables the seller to effectively learn and implement mechanisms in evolving market settings, providing robust performance guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

### [334] [Fully lifted \emph{blirp} interpolation -- a large deviation view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19272)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large deviation upgrade to a previously established statistical interpolating mechanism, enabling analysis of typical and atypical random structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expand the applicability of a statistical interpolating mechanism from analyzing typical structures to harder atypical cases.

Method: Enhances previously established techniques with a large deviation framework and connects its applications to local entropies.

Result: Broader analysis of random structures and new insights into clustering and computational gaps in optimization problems.

Conclusion: The upgrade significantly extends the utility of the mechanism, with elegant mathematical formulations useful for diverse further studies.

Abstract: [104] introduced a powerful \emph{fully lifted} (fl) statistical
interpolating mechanism. It established a nested connection between blirps
(bilinearly indexed random processes) and their decoupled (linearly indexed)
comparative counterparts. We here revisit the comparison from [104] and
introduce its a \emph{large deviation} upgrade. The new machinery allows to
substantially widen the [104]'s range of applicability. In addition to
\emph{typical}, studying analytically much harder \emph{atypical} random
structures features is now possible as well. To give a bit of a practical
flavor, we show how the obtained results connect to the so-called \emph{local
entropies} (LE) and their predicated role in understanding solutions clustering
and associated \emph{computational gaps} in hard random optimization problems.
As was the case in [104], even though the technical considerations often appear
as fairly involved, the final interpolating forms admit elegant expressions
thereby providing a relatively easy to use tool readily available for further
studies. Moreover, as the considered models encompass all well known random
structures discussed in [104], the obtained results automatically apply to them
as well.

### [335] [A large deviation view of \emph{stationarized} fully lifted blirp interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19273)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper discusses bilinearly indexed random processes (blirps) and their interpolating mechanisms, building on earlier studies to address atypical random structures and computational gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance the understanding of blirps by introducing improved mechanisms that explain atypical features in random optimization problems, which are linked to computational gaps.

Method: The authors extend prior work through the development of new interpolation and stationarization mechanisms, focusing on parameters like local entropies to analyze atypical clustering in random structures.

Result: They uncover elegant fundamental relations among interpolating parameters that significantly extend the range of applicability of prior mechanisms.

Conclusion: The mechanisms and relations discovered serve as valuable tools for further exploration in understanding يصبح optimizing problems.

Abstract: We consider \emph{bilinearly indexed random processes} (blirp) and study
their interpolating comparative mechanisms. Generic introduction of the
\emph{fully lifted} (fl) blirp interpolation in [105] was followed by a
corresponding stationarization counterpart in [103]. A \emph{large deviation}
upgrade of [105] introduced in companion paper [106] is complemented here with
the corresponding one of [103]. Similarly to [106], the mechanism that we
introduce extends the range of [103]'s applicability so that it encompasses
random structures \emph{atypical} features. Among others these include the
\emph{local entropies} (LE) which explain atypical solutions clusterings in
hard random optimization problems believed to be directly responsible for the
presumable existence of the so-called \emph{computational gaps}. Moreover (and
similar to [105]), despite on occasion somewhat involved technical
considerations, the final forms of the uncovered fundamental interpolating
parameters relations are rather elegant and as such provide a valuable tool
readily available for further use.

### [336] [Iterative Quantum Feature Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19461)
*Nasa Matsumoto,Quoc Hoan Tran,Koki Chinzei,Yasuhiro Endo,Hirotaka Oshima*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: IQFMs improve quantum machine learning through a hybrid approach to address noise issues and variational quantum bottlenecks, achieving high benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum machine learning models face challenges like circuit noise and computational inefficiencies in gradient estimation, impacting training and deployment on quantum hardware.

Method: IQFMs utilize a hybrid quantum-classical approach with shallow Quantum Feature Maps connected iteratively via classically computed augmentation weights, leveraging contrastive learning and layer-wise training.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate IQFMs outperform quantum CNNs in noisy quantum data tasks and achieve comparable performance to classical neural networks in image classification.

Conclusion: IQFMs offer a viable solution to overcome limitations in quantum-enhanced machine learning and improve overall performance in both quantum and classical tasks.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

### [337] [Conservative quantum offline model-based optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19714)
*Kristian Sotirov,Annie E. Paine,Savvas Varsamopoulos,Antonio A. Gentile,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved approach called COM-QEL, which merges quantum extremal learning (QEL) with conservative modeling to generate more reliable solutions for offline model-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the reliability of quantum extremal learning (QEL) for offline optimization, as standard predictive models can overestimate objectives in unexplored regions, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid method called COM-QEL, which combines the expressive variational quantum circuits of QEL with a conservative objective model (COM) that uses regularization to make cautious predictions on out-of-distribution inputs.

Result: Empirical experiments on optimization benchmarks show that the COM-QEL approach consistently produces solutions with higher true objective values than the standard QEL approach.

Conclusion: COM-QEL merges the strengths of quantum neural networks and conservative modeling, offering better generalization and higher reliability for offline optimization tasks compared to its predecessor, QEL.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

### [338] [Continuous-variable Quantum Diffusion Model for State Generation and Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19270)
*Haitao Huang,Chuangtao Chen,Qinglin Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework using Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion combined with CV Quantum Neural Networks to efficiently generate and restore quantum states with high fidelity, addressing environmental noise and complexity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two critical challenges in continuous-variable quantum information processing: generating complex quantum states and preserving them against environmental noise.

Method: It proposes two models: CVQD-G for quantum state generation, using a forward diffusion process with a thermal loss channel and a backward denoising process via CVQNNs, and CVQD-R for restoring quantum states from thermal degradation, particularly coherent states.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm high-fidelity generation of Gaussian and non-Gaussian states (over 99% fidelity) and robust restoration of corrupted states, alongside favorable complexity and scalability for training and inference.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient, scalable, and robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation, demonstrating potential for realistic continuous-variable quantum systems.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

### [339] [A Qubit-Efficient Hybrid Quantum Encoding Mechanism for Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19275)
*Hevish Cowlessur,Tansu Alpcan,Chandra Thapa,Seyit Camtepe,Neel Kanth Kundu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis (qPGA), a classical approach for dimensionality reduction and efficient quantum encoding of high-dimensional datasets, outperforming current quantum methods in preserving structure and resisting reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit quantum systems, improve current solutions like quantum autoencoders, and enhance robustness against reconstruction attacks.

Method: The authors propose qPGA, a classical method based on Riemannian geometry, to reduce dimensionality by projecting data onto a unit Hilbert sphere. This preserves neighborhood structure and reduces qubit requirements for amplitude encoding.

Result: Empirical studies show qPGA achieves better preservation of local structure and greater resistance to reconstruction attacks than quantum and hybrid autoencoders. For QML tasks, qPGA achieves over 99% accuracy and F1-scores on datasets like MNIST, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: qPGA is a scalable, non-invertible, and noise-resilient method for dimensionality reduction and quantum encoding, offering significant improvements for quantum machine learning on noisy hardware.

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

*Diego Di Carlo,Mathieu Fontaine,Aditya Arie Nugraha,Yoshiaki Bando,Kazuyoshi Yoshii*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust SSL technique using an $\alpha$-stable model and a neural network, outperforming existing methods for multiple sound sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sound source localization in challenging multi-source environments by introducing a more robust estimation mechanism.

Method: An $\alpha$-stable model is combined with a neural network-based 'Neural Steerer' to interpolate steering vectors for sound localization.

Result: The proposed technique achieves higher objective scores compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of $\alpha$-stable modeling and Neural Steerer offers a superior approach for sound source localization in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

*Christoph Minixhofer,Ondrej Klejch,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text to Speech Distribution Score 2 (TTSDS2) as a robust metric correlating well with subjective evaluations for TTS systems. It also provides resources for a multilingual TTS benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in evaluating TTS systems due to inconsistency and lack of correlation between subjective (e.g., MOS) and objective metrics, especially with advanced systems producing nearly indistinguishable synthetic speech.

Method: Developed TTSDS2 and compared it with 16 metrics across various domains and languages to validate its correlation with subjective scores. Released supporting resources like a dataset of 11,000 opinion scores, a recreation pipeline, and a multilingual benchmark.

Result: TTSDS2 exhibited a Spearman correlation above 0.50 across all tested domains, outperforming other metrics. Resources provided ensure robust evaluation for synthetic speech close to real speech.

Conclusion: TTSDS2 establishes itself as a reliable metric for TTS evaluation and the paper contributes vital resources to advance multilingual synthetic speech evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

*Abhay Kumar,Kunal Verma,Omkar More*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD) to improve audio deepfake detection, focusing on South-Asian linguistic diversity, a gap in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio deepfake detection models lack effectiveness in linguistically diverse and culturally distinct contexts, particularly in South-Asian countries, due to insufficient representation of ethnic accents in current datasets.

Method: The authors created the IndieFake Dataset (IFD), comprising 27.17 hours of audio from 50 English-speaking Indian speakers, featuring both genuine and deepfake samples with balanced distribution and speaker-level characterization.

Result: The IndieFake Dataset (IFD) outperforms the widely used ASVspoof21 (DF) dataset in speech deepfake detection and poses a greater challenge compared to the ITW dataset, improving detection for diverse linguistic and cultural scenarios.

Conclusion: IFD addresses a critical gap in audio deepfake detection datasets, enhancing model performance for diverse linguistic contexts and fostering fairness in digital security solutions.

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide practitioners with reliable tools to infer optimal transport maps, a critical task in applications involving mass rearrangement between probability distributions.

Method: The paper focuses on reviewing existing studies on estimation techniques, limit theorems, and specific cases/variants in optimal transport (OT) setups.

Result: The review highlights the advancements in understanding optimal transport maps and their applications while consolidating related works.

minimizing a specified cost. In this paper we review recent advances in
estimating and developing limit theorems for the OT map, using samples from the
underlying distributions. We also review parallel lines of work that establish
similar results for special cases and variants of the basic OT setup. We
conclude with a discussion of key directions for future research with the goal

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel double mixture directed graph model to infer multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data, capturing heterogeneity and enabling improved understanding of cascading patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand network cascades and infer diffusion networks to uncover causality, predict outcomes, and optimize information spread within interconnected populations.

Method: The proposed approach involves a double mixture model with layer-specific constraints to infer diffusion networks, forming a convex formulation for computational and statistical guarantees.

Result: The model successfully recovers diverse diffusion structures through simulations and reveals research topic propagation networks in social sciences across U.S. universities.

Conclusion: Double mixture directed graphs provide a robust framework for analyzing and understanding network cascades, making advancements in forecasting and identifying causal pathways across layers.

Abstract: Network cascade refers to diffusion processes in which outcome changes within
part of an interconnected population trigger a sequence of changes across the
entire network. These cascades are governed by underlying diffusion networks,
which are often latent. Inferring such networks is critical for understanding
cascade pathways, uncovering Granger causality of interaction mechanisms among
individuals, and enabling tasks such as forecasting or maximizing information
propagation. In this project, we propose a novel double mixture directed graph
model for inferring multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data. The
proposed model represents cascade pathways as a mixture of diffusion networks
across different layers, effectively capturing the strong heterogeneity present
in real-world cascades. Additionally, the model imposes layer-specific
structural constraints, enabling diffusion networks at different layers to
capture complementary cascading patterns at the population level. A key
advantage of our model is its convex formulation, which allows us to establish
both statistical and computational guarantees for the resulting diffusion
network estimates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the
model's performance in recovering diverse diffusion structures. Finally, we
apply the proposed method to analyze cascades of research topics in the social
sciences across U.S. universities, revealing the underlying diffusion networks
of research topic propagation among institutions.

TL;DR: ReLink introduces a computational framework for sustainable planar linkage mechanism design using standardized reusable parts, emphasizing reduced resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate circular economy principles into mechanism design by prioritizing part reuse and minimizing new component creation.

Method: The framework consists of generative algorithms for creating designs from available parts and optimization for matching designs to specific trajectory curves, addressing challenges like combinatorial complexity and solution validity.

Result: ReLink demonstrates the potential to balance kinematic performance and environmental impact, emphasizing CO2 footprint considerations in design trade-offs.

Conclusion: The paper establishes ReLink as a foundational computational tool for promoting sustainable design practices and advancing circular design in mechanism engineering.

Abstract: The Circular Economy framework emphasizes sustainability by reducing resource
consumption and waste through the reuse of components and materials. This paper
presents ReLink, a computational framework for the circular design of planar
linkage mechanisms using available standard parts. Unlike most mechanism design
methods, which assume the ability to create custom parts and infinite part
availability, ReLink prioritizes the reuse of discrete, standardized
components, thus minimizing the need for new parts. The framework consists of
two main components: design generation, where a generative design algorithm
generates mechanisms from an inventory of available parts, and inverse design,
which uses optimization methods to identify designs that match a user-defined
trajectory curve. The paper also examines the trade-offs between kinematic
performance and CO2 footprint when incorporating new parts. Challenges such as
the combinatorial nature of the design problem and the enforcement of valid
solutions are addressed. By combining sustainability principles with kinematic
synthesis, ReLink lays the groundwork for further research into computational
circular design to support the development of systems that integrate reused
components into mechanical products.

TL;DR: This paper explores using uplift modeling for analyzing the effects of company adjustments on financial status, focusing on time-dependent treatments and proposing the MTDnet framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexity of analyzing company adjustments, which are time-dependent and involve multiple steps, a challenge not fully addressed by existing uplift models for simpler treatment scenarios.

Method: The study uses a real-world dataset from Luxembourg and applies two meta-learners, three uplift models, and proposes a novel framework (MTDnet) that considers the temporal order of treatments.

Result: The experimental findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for the sequence and timing of company adjustments when estimating their effects.

Conclusion: Incorporating the timing of company adjustments improves the accuracy of effect estimation, illustrating the value of the proposed MTDnet framework.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

*Jose Blanchet,Jiayi Cheng,Hao Liu,Yang Liu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses a Bayesian diffusion control problem with model misspecification issues, proposing a distributionally robust approach using adversarial methods and neural networks for efficient strategy computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incorrect prior specification in Bayesian diffusion control, which can degrade policy performance.

Method: Propose distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) using adversarial approaches, strong duality theory, stochastic analysis tools, and neural networks for efficient computation.

Result: They derived an effective algorithm for computing DRBC strategies. The approach is simplified when the uncertainty lies within a Kullback-Leibler divergence set, demonstrating robustness in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: DRBC offers a robust and computationally effective solution to handle model misspecification in Bayesian diffusion control problems.

Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility
maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift
of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the
posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly.
However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and
the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy
performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a
distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the
controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence
neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in
economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization
settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation.
Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are
able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our
numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a
result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal
strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly
simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a
prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristic methods for matrix seriation lack rigorous, model-based approaches to fully represent objectives and constraints with fidelity in relational data analysis.

Method: The authors develop mathematical programming models for stress criteria (nonlinear and linearized), including Hamiltonian path-based reformulations for structured settings, to optimize spatial arrangements efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments prove that these optimization-based methods improve solution quality, interpretability, and adaptability across synthetic, real-world, and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges heuristic and exact methods in matrix seriation, offering a versatile and high-fidelity approach with improved performance and potential for broader applications in data science.

Abstract: Matrix seriation, the problem of permuting the rows and columns of a matrix
to uncover latent structure, is a fundamental technique in data science,
particularly in the visualization and analysis of relational data. Applications
span clustering, anomaly detection, and beyond. In this work, we present a
unified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix
seriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages
combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives
and constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional
heuristic methods and exact solution techniques.
  We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based
stress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized
counterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann
neighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that
enables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the
reordered matrix.
  To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set
of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly
curated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation
literature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not
only enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile
foundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.

### [349] [First-Order Sparse Convex Optimization: Better Rates with Sparse Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19075)
*Dan Garber*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper investigates how sparse updates can achieve linear convergence rates for sparse convex optimization problems while improving runtime and simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods achieve improved convergence rates for sparse convex optimization problems but fail to reduce per-iteration runtime effectively, posing challenges for high-dimensional problems.

Method: The authors propose sparse update methods that leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions to maintain linear convergence rates while significantly reducing computational cost per iteration.

Result: Sparse updates provide linear convergence rates tied to the improved mixed-norm condition number, resulting in better overall runtime and simpler implementation.

Conclusion: By employing sparse updates, this approach achieves efficient optimization for sparse convex problems with reduced computation and easier implementation.

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

*Subrata Paul,Sukanta Das,Biplab K Sikdar*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computing model using in-memory computing (IMC) to reduce CPU workload by employing Cayley tree-based logic and implementing it on FPGA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing CPU workload in data-intensive tasks by utilizing memory as a compute platform.

Method: Model incorporates a Cayley tree framework for computational tasks, and hardware systems using conventional and new memory architectures are implemented.

Result: Worst-case complexities for searching and max/min computation within IMC are O(log n), while sorting complexity is O(n log n). Implementations show competitive performance against existing designs.

Conclusion: IMC platform is demonstrated as a viable alternative for data-intensive computation, offering efficiency in isolated tasks with FPGA validation.

Abstract: This work proposes a computing model to reduce the workload of CPU. It relies
on the data intensive computation in memory, where the data reside, and
effectively realizes an in-memory computing (IMC) platform. Each memory word,
with additional logic, acts as a tiny processing element which forms the node
of a Cayley tree. The Cayley tree in turn defines the framework for solving the
data intensive computational problems. It finds the solutions for in-memory
searching, computing the max (min) in-memory and in-memory sorting while
reducing the involvement of CPU. The worst case time complexities of the IMC
based solutions for in-memory searching and computing max (min) in-memory are
$\mathcal{O}\log{n}$. Such solutions are independent of the order of elements
in the list. The worst case time complexity of in-memory sorting, on the other
hand, is $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$. Two types of hardware implementations of the
IMC platform are proposed. One is based on the existing/conventional memory
architecture, and the other one is on a newly defined memory architecture. The
solutions are further implemented in FPGA platform to prove the effectiveness
of the IMC architecture while comparing with the state-of-the art designs.

TL;DR: Kling-Foley introduces a multimodal Video-to-Audio model that uses novel diffusion transformers and advanced modules for superior semantic alignment, synchronization, and audio quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating synchronized, semantically aligned audio from video inputs by leveraging multimodal interactions.

Method: The proposed method leverages multimodal diffusion transformers and modules for visual semantic representation, audio-visual synchronization, and stereo rendering. A universal latent audio codec is introduced for diverse audio modeling.

Result: Kling-Foley achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in semantic alignment, synchronization, and audio quality, validated by experiments on the newly open-sourced Kling-Audio-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: Kling-Foley successfully demonstrates that nuanced multimodal interactions and advanced modules enhance audio generation, setting new benchmarks for Video-to-Audio synthesis models.

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

TL;DR: ProxelGen is a protein generative model utilizing 3D densities (proxels) instead of point clouds, enhancing novelty, designability, and shape conditioning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve protein generative modeling by leveraging 3D voxelized density representations, enabling better performance and new capabilities compared to traditional point cloud approaches.

Method: ProxelGen uses a 3D CNN-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) combined with a diffusion model to operate on latent spaces of voxelized protein densities.

Result: ProxelGen outperforms state-of-the-art models in novelty, FID scores, and scaffolding benchmarks while retaining comparable designability to the training set.

Conclusion: 3D density-based approaches like ProxelGen unlock enhanced protein generation, with improved novelty and design flexibility, particularly benefiting shape-conditioned tasks.

Abstract: We develop ProxelGen, a protein structure generative model that operates on
3D densities as opposed to the prevailing 3D point cloud representations.
Representing proteins as voxelized densities, or proxels, enables new tasks and
conditioning capabilities. We generate proteins encoded as proxels via a 3D
CNN-based VAE in conjunction with a diffusion model operating on its latent
space. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProxelGen's samples achieve higher
novelty, better FID scores, and the same level of designability as the training
set. ProxelGen's advantages are demonstrated in a standard motif scaffolding
benchmark, and we show how 3D density-based generation allows for more flexible
shape conditioning.

*Viatcheslav Gurev,Timothy Rumbell*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper explores how a well-chosen relative positional encoding in standard transformer models enables more efficient and scalable molecular conformation generation, surpassing a larger non-equivariant model on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating accurate molecular conformations is essential for drug discovery, but existing models either rely on specialized equivariant architectures or require large-scale non-equivariant models, which can be inefficient.

Method: The approach involved using a transformer model enhanced with relative positional encoding modeled as a negative attention bias, inspired by ALiBi from NLP. The encoding reflects shortest path distances between molecular graph nodes.

Result: A 25-million-parameter transformer model with this encoding outperformed a larger 64-million-parameter non-equivariant model on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark.

Conclusion: With effective positional encoding, smaller-scale non-equivariant transformer models can outperform larger counterparts, opening new possibilities for generative molecular conformation models.

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach combining Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAVs to enhance 3D digital reconstruction capabilities, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of flight dynamics and power consumption in miniaturized UAVs, which limit their autonomy and mission performance, particularly in constrained environments.

Method: The method involves designing and evaluating an N3DR-based pipeline using advanced models (Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto) to capture high-quality 3D reconstructions of objects with small UAVs. The performance is assessed against a baseline SfM algorithm using various metrics.

Result: The results show that the N3DR pipeline significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction and supports high-precision tasks like mapping and anomaly detection in constrained spaces.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating N3DR into miniaturized UAVs enhances their performance, making them suitable for high-precision 3D applications in difficult environments.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

*B. Paroli,F. Borghi,M. A. C. Potenza,P. Milani*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper introduces the receptron, an enhanced model of threshold logic gates (TLGs) with nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, enabling higher classification performance. It demonstrates intrinsic selective activation properties for analog inputs, applicable in multidimensional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linear nature of traditional TLGs limits their classification capabilities, calling for networks to handle complex tasks. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by proposing a single-unit model with nonlinear properties.

Method: The authors propose the receptron model, characterized by input-dependent nonlinear weight functions, and formally demonstrate its selective activation for analog inputs within specific domains.

Result: The receptron shows intrinsic selective activation properties for analog inputs in cubic domains within 3D space, and the model can extend to n-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: Receptron-based networks offer superior classification capabilities, are suitable for handling numerous analog inputs, and simplify edge applications by reducing training complexity.

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of pre-trained models for analyzing full-length circular eccDNA, which play important roles in cancer-related gene regulation.

Method: Develop and test eccDNAMamba, integrating forward and reverse passes with a novel augmentation strategy to handle circular DNA structure, and offering linear-time complexity.

Result: eccDNAMamba shows strong classification performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, validated using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: eccDNAMamba provides a robust framework for studying circular DNA genomes, overcoming limitations in sequence length and computational inefficiency.

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream
analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide
resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the numerical instabilities encountered in machine-learnt surrogates when solving larger PDE systems, a recurring challenge in the field.

Method: The study uses a viscous Burgers'-ML system as a prototype, diagnoses the cause of instabilities, prescribes stabilization techniques, and implements Mori-Zwanzig based methods to enhance accuracy.

Result: The authors identify root causes of instability and propose effective strategies for both stabilization and accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The research offers valuable insights into stabilizing machine-learnt surrogates for complex PDEs and leveraging Mori-Zwanzig formalism to refine these solutions.

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger

towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy
of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered
limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw
insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a
viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the
instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve
the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents an extended causal decomposition analysis for evaluating multi-domain interventions on educational disparities, addressing the gaps in existing single-domain strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address educational disparities rooted in social inequalities and to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-domain interventions since single-domain approaches may not be sufficient for marginalized groups.

Method: The authors developed an extended causal decomposition analysis targeting multiple causally ordered intervening factors and introduced a triply robust estimator using machine learning to address challenges like model misspecification.

Result: The method was applied to data on math achievement disparities from the High School Longitudinal Study, focusing on the effects of interventions like equitable access to high-performing schools and early Algebra I enrollment across racial groups.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates a way to evaluate the synergistic impacts of multi-domain educational interventions, potentially informing better strategies to reduce racial achievement disparities.

Abstract: Educational disparities are rooted in and perpetuate social inequalities
across multiple dimensions such as race, socioeconomic status, and geography.
To reduce disparities, most intervention strategies focus on a single domain
and frequently evaluate their effectiveness by using causal decomposition
analysis. However, a growing body of research suggests that single-domain
interventions may be insufficient for individuals marginalized on multiple
fronts. While interventions across multiple domains are increasingly proposed,
there is limited guidance on appropriate methods for evaluating their
effectiveness. To address this gap, we develop an extended causal decomposition
analysis that simultaneously targets multiple causally ordered intervening
factors, allowing for the assessment of their synergistic effects. These
scenarios often involve challenges related to model misspecification due to
complex interactions among group categories, intervening factors, and their
confounders with the outcome. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a
triply robust estimator that leverages machine learning techniques to address
potential model misspecification. We apply our method to a cohort of students
from the High School Longitudinal Study, focusing on math achievement
disparities between Black, Hispanic, and White high schoolers. Specifically, we
examine how two sequential interventions - equalizing the proportion of
students who attend high-performing schools and equalizing enrollment in
Algebra I by 9th grade across racial groups - may reduce these disparities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'pedagogical prompting,' a method to teach students how to use large language models (LLMs) effectively in learning and evaluates its impact through a study in undergraduate computer science education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in LLM applications, especially in education, has raised concerns about their misuse leading to poor learning outcomes. The study aims to turn this misuse into an effective learning experience by teaching students how to prompt LLMs correctly.

Method: The authors conducted a formative survey with 36 instructors in undergraduate CS education to inform instructional design. They then developed a scenario-based interactive learning system and tested its effectiveness through pre/post-tests involving 22 novice CS students.

Result: The intervention significantly improved students' skills in pedagogical help-seeking using LLMs, elicited positive attitudes, and heightened their willingness to utilize pedagogical prompts in the future.

Conclusion: This study provides a theoretical framework for pedagogical prompting, insights into instructors' perspectives, and a scalable learning intervention design that shows promise for teaching LLM-based help-seeking. It could also be incorporated into tools like ChatGPT for broader educational use.

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Result: Strong classification model performance was achieved, establishing a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: HARPT serves as a public resource for interdisciplinary studies in health informatics, cybersecurity, and NLP.

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store
reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset
comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAM-NET, an AI model for predicting global atmospheric variables up to the ionosphere with high accuracy and fast computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance modeling of the entire atmosphere for understanding gravity wave propagation and atmospheric coupling while improving computational efficiency.

Method: CAM-NET employs the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) for global dynamics modeling and features a modular architecture that separates core physical variable predictions from tracer variable predictions.

Result: CAM-NET achieves accuracy comparable to advanced climate models like WACCM-X but is 1000x faster in inference and capable of year-long simulations in minutes.

Conclusion: The model offers a significant advancement in atmospheric modeling, with strong predictive capabilities and efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios.

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces flow-based kernels for machine-learned coarse-grained (MLCG) force fields, addressing limitations of noise-based kernels and enabling accurate CG forces from configuration samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges in machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG), particularly the infeasibility of traditional force matching due to unavailability of atomistic force data and significant distortions introduced by noise-based kernels.

Method: The authors propose using general kernels based on normalizing flows to improve the calibration of CG force fields, reducing distortions while preserving conformational accuracy.

Result: The flow-based kernels enable the generation of high-quality coarse-grained forces by only using configurational samples, validated on small protein simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed normalizing flow-based kernel approach effectively mitigates local distortions and ensures accurate global behavior, offering a significant improvement over existing noise-based methods in MLCG.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

### [363] [MATE: LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Translation Environment for Accessibility Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19502)
*Aleksandr Algazinov,Matt Laing,Paul Laban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper discusses MATE, a multimodal accessibility system designed to assist users, especially those with disabilities, by converting data into understandable formats based on their needs. It is adaptable, privacy-focused, and outperforms other models in task identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle accessibility issues faced by users, especially individuals with disabilities, within digital environments where existing systems lack personalization and flexibility.

Method: The paper introduces MATE, an open-source multimodal accessibility multi-agent system that combines modality conversion, machine learning models, and local operation to enhance customization, compatibility, and privacy. A key component is ModCon-Task-Identifier for precise modality task extraction.

Result: Experimental results show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models in identifying modality conversion tasks from user input, demonstrating the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MATE offers a flexible, secure, and high-performing solution for accessibility challenges, with wide applicability in domains like healthcare and ensures comprehensive user assistance. The code and data are openly available.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

### [364] [Binsparse: A Specification for Cross-Platform Storage of Sparse Matrices and Tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19175)
*Benjamin Brock,Willow Ahrens,Hameer Abbasi,Timothy A. Davis,Juni Kim,James Kitchen,Spencer Patty,Isaac Virshup,Erik Welch*

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Binsparse, a cross-platform binary format for sparse matrices and tensors, designed to overcome inefficiencies of the widely-used text-based formats like Matrix Market and FROSTT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of ASCII-based formats (larger file sizes and slower parsing) in storing sparse matrices and tensors, which creates a performance bottleneck in computational workflows.

Method: The authors proposed Binsparse, a binary format combining a JSON descriptor with binary arrays, compatible with platforms such as HDF5, Zarr, and NPZ. They provided reference implementations and tested it across several datasets.

Result: Binsparse achieved significant improvements in file size (2.4x smaller without compression, 7.5x with compression) and parsing speed (read speedups of 26.5x, write speedups of up to 31x compared to Matrix Market).

Conclusion: Binsparse offers an efficient, portable, and modular binary format for sparse data, outperforming text-based alternatives in terms of file size and read/write performance.

Abstract: Sparse matrices and tensors are ubiquitous throughout multiple subfields of
computing. The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and
on-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are
the Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to
the inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes
and longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an
in-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse
computation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix
to disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is
common practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable
binary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently
no cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a
cross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse
is a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which
describes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of
binary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as
HDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse
spanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our
Binsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a
selection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format
shows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with
compression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a
state-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read
speedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write
speedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.

Motivation: Confusion exists due to the interchangeable use of the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security," impairing research clarity.

Method: The authors provide rigorous definitions, research focuses, and use analogies to explain the interdependency between AI safety and security.

Result: The study identifies conceptual boundaries and interrelations, enhancing understanding of how security breaches and safety failures interact.

Conclusion: This distinction is vital for advancing research, collaboration, and reliable AI deployment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise
research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,
enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study investigates the potential of using conversational AI (ChatGPT) to enhance student engagement in large computer science classes, finding promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of student engagement in large computer science classes.

Method: A within-subject study compared student engagement during in-class activities with and without ChatGPT in a software engineering course.

Result: The study found that using ChatGPT improved engagement with learning content during in-class activities.

Conclusion: ChatGPT has potential to improve engagement in large class settings; implications discussed further in the study.

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

*Zengqing Wu,Run Peng,Takayuki Ito,Chuan Xiao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of large language model (LLM)-based social simulations and sets guidelines to improve their meaningful application in social science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the use of LLMs in social simulations and to identify their reliability and constraints in contributing to social science research.

Method: The authors examine three boundary challenges—alignment, consistency, and robustness—proposing heuristic boundaries and practical recommendations for using LLM simulations effectively.

Result: LLM simulations are argued to be reliable for understanding collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, with a focus on alignment with population averages and proper validation methods.

Conclusion: With a checklist and guidelines, the paper establishes practical boundaries to ensure meaningful and reliable application of LLM-based simulations in social science research.

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

*Lukas Radl,Felix Windisch,Thomas Deixelberger,Jozef Hladky,Michael Steiner,Dieter Schmalstieg,Markus Steinberger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method for precise and efficient surface extraction from 3D Gaussians, achieving high-quality meshes and reducing computation time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in 3D Gaussian representation for image-based scene reconstruction, accurately extracting surfaces in large-scale, unbounded environments remains challenging due to the reliance on approximate depth estimates and sorting heuristics.

Method: The authors propose Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), which introduces hierarchical resorting, a robust Gaussian depth formulation, a level-set regularizer on the opacity field, and geometrically-consistent loss functions. Additionally, they implement a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm optimized for their opacity framework.

Result: SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy and improves efficiency, cutting total processing time by more than three times and reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: SOF provides a more accurate and faster approach to surface reconstruction, advancing the usefulness of Gaussian-based rendering for efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian splatting scenes efficiently, with the aim to reduce memory requirements and support real-time performance on devices.

Method: The method leverages virtual memory and virtual texturing techniques to dynamically identify and stream visible Gaussians to the GPU. It also integrates level of detail techniques to optimize rendering speeds for large-scale scenes.

Result: The approach successfully reduces memory usage, accelerates rendering of complex scenes, and demonstrates practical impact on both desktop and mobile devices.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively enhances real-time rendering capabilities for large Gaussian splatting scenes, providing solutions for memory optimization and scalability across device platforms.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

### [372] [Uncovering Conceptual Blindspots in Generative Image Models Using Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19708)
*Matyas Bohacek,Thomas Fel,Maneesh Agrawala,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using sparse autoencoders to systematically identify and analyze generative image models' "conceptual blindspots," exposing discrepancies between training data concepts and model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is that generative image models often fail to represent simple concepts expected in their training data, raising questions about whether these failures are anomalies or inherent limitations of the models.

Method: The authors use sparse autoencoders (SAEs), particularly an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) trained on DINOv2 features, to derive interpretable concept embeddings and identify discrepancies between the real and generated images for 32,000 concepts. This was applied on four popular generative models.

Result: The analysis uncovered examples of suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, white spaces) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., palm trees, wood textures), and identified memorization artifacts where models replicate specific visual templates from the training data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models, contributing to the understanding of their conceptual fidelity and limitations.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive, task-agnostic review of multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) methods across multiple technical perspectives, addressing gaps in existing surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of existing MSFP surveys, which are limited to single tasks or perspectives, making it difficult for researchers in other fields to gain comprehensive insights.

Method: It organizes MSFP research by introducing and analyzing methods from multi-modal, multi-agent, time-series, and multimodal large language model (LLM) fusion perspectives, rather than focusing on task-specific approaches.

Result: The paper delivers a structured review highlighting diverse technical methods in MSFP and investigates their applications while discussing open challenges.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a resource for researchers to understand progress in MSFP and provides insights for tackling challenges and exploring future directions.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

Motivation: Machine learning methods are underutilized in predicting credit risks despite their success in other predictive fields.

Method: Five ML models—Random Forests, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost—are compared against logistic regression using a benchmark credit risk dataset.

Result: Strengths and weaknesses of predictive models are outlined, showcasing the capabilities of ML techniques alongside logistic regression.

Conclusion: ML algorithms offer valuable performance benefits for credit risk analysis, offering potential improvements for loan portfolio PD predictions.

Abstract: Predicting the probability of default (PD) of prospective loans is a critical
objective for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide variety of prediction
tasks; yet, they remain relatively underutilised in credit risk analysis. This
paper highlights the opportunities that ML algorithms offer to this field by
comparing the performance of five predictive models-Random Forests, Decision
Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost-to the predominantly used
logistic regression, over a benchmark dataset from Scheule et al. (Credit Risk
Analytics: The R Companion). Our findings underscore the strengths and
weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into the most effective

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMBer, a framework using reinforcement learning and physics software to autonomously create particle physics models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-building in particle physics often relies on theoretical intuition and is labor-intensive, prompting the need for automation.

Method: AMBer combines reinforcement learning agents with physics software to identify symmetry groups, particle content, and representations for viable models while reducing free parameters.

Result: AMBer successfully validates known theory space regions and explores a novel symmetry group, demonstrating efficiency and innovation.

Conclusion: Automating model-building with reinforcement learning offers promising advancements in theoretical physics and can extend to other areas of physics research.

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning
with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical
model-building problems in the future.

TL;DR: This study addresses the challenge of recovering high-quality ECG signals from radar with limited training data using a cardio-focusing algorithm and a transfer learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous methods that required high-quality radar signals and extensive radar-ECG training pairs, which restrict their applicability in new scenarios due to data scarcity.

Method: The authors developed a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm for dynamic cardiac location tracking and a transfer learning model (RFcardi) that leverages the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, requiring minimal radar-ECG pairs for fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed CFT algorithm accurately tracks cardiac locations for better radar signal acquisition, and the RFcardi model successfully produces reliable ECG recoveries using only a limited number of radar-ECG training pairs.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that their methods enable effective radar-based ECG recovery under data-scarce conditions, expanding its applicability to new scenarios.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

Result: Proposes models for decoding tasks and predicting mental health measures, fostering advancements in EEG generalization and psychiatric analysis.

Conclusion: The research promotes computational psychiatry by improving EEG model generalization and aiding in mental health diagnosis, while fostering innovations in neuroscience and clinical applications.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

### [378] [Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451)
*Seunghun Lee,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Hyuncheol Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses token communication (TC) optimization for generative AI in outage channels, proposing a novel framework to preserve semantic integrity while reducing computational complexity significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of token communication, where the loss of a token disrupts the semantic meaning of messages, particularly in outage channels.

Method: A framework called SemPA-Look, which uses residual semantic score (RSS) for robust semantic preservation and a lookahead search-inspired algorithm to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show SemPA-Look achieves high semantic retention with 40× less computational complexity compared to exhaustive search, and 10× less compared to genetic algorithms.

Conclusion: SemPA-Look is a practical, efficient solution for token communication, improving semantic preservation and computational efficiency in remote AIGC tasks and similar applications.

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

### [379] [From Minimax Optimal Importance Sampling to Uniformly Ergodic Importance-tempered MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19186)
*Quan Zhou*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper explores optimal importance sampling and introduces an importance-tempered Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for improving sampling precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in importance sampling and improve estimation via tempered Metropolis-Hastings algorithms.

Method: Proves theoretical results for minimax optimal trial distributions and stationary distributions for importance weighting methods.

Result: Identifies optimal conditions for importance sampling and importance-tempered algorithms, enabling better trial distribution design.

Conclusion: Advances in importance sampling and tempering enable better precision and convergence, particularly for distributions with specific tail behaviors.

Abstract: We make two closely related theoretical contributions to the use of
importance sampling schemes. First, for independent sampling, we prove that the
minimax optimal trial distribution coincides with the target if and only if the
target distribution has no atom with probability greater than $1/2$, where
"minimax" means that the worst-case asymptotic variance of the self-normalized
importance sampling estimator is minimized. When a large atom exists, it should
be downweighted by the trial distribution. A similar phenomenon holds for a
continuous target distribution concentrated on a small set. Second, we argue
that it is often advantageous to run the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a
tempered stationary distribution, $\pi(x)^\beta$, and correct for the bias by
importance weighting. The dynamics of this "importance-tempered" sampling
scheme can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain. We prove that for
one-dimensional targets with polynomial tails, $\pi(x) \propto (1 +
|x|)^{-\gamma}$, this chain is uniformly ergodic if and only if $1/\gamma <
\beta < (\gamma - 2)/\gamma$. These results suggest that for target
distributions with light or polynomial tails of order $\gamma > 3$, importance
tempering can improve the precision of time-average estimators and essentially
eliminate the need for burn-in.

### [380] [Network Structures as an Attack Surface: Topology-Based Privacy Leakage in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19260)
*Murtaza Rangwala,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy vulnerabilities stemming from network topology knowledge in federated learning systems and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional privacy research focuses only on gradient-based attacks in federated learning, leaving topology-based privacy leakage unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage using simulations of six adversarial knowledge scenarios, and proposing defense via structural noise injection.

Result: It demonstrated high success rates of topology attacks (up to 84.1%) even under high differential privacy, and found partial knowledge scenarios outperforming complete knowledge scenarios in attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: Network topology introduces significant privacy risks in federated learning systems, but structural noise injection offers promising mitigation against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

### [381] [On the efficacy of old features for the detection of new bots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19635)
*Rocco De Nicola,Marinella Petrocchi,Manuel Pratelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores effective approaches to bot detection on Twitter by evaluating four advanced feature sets on six recent datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bots heavily influence public opinion and online platforms by distributing spam and biased content, prompting the need for effective detection solutions.

Method: The study evaluates four feature sets (including Botometer scores, account profile, timeline features, and Twitter client data) using recent Twitter datasets to analyze their performance in bot detection.

Result: The analysis suggests that general-purpose classifiers using computationally inexpensive features can detect advanced bots effectively.

Conclusion: Detecting sophisticated bots may not require complex or costly features; simpler, less expensive data could suffice in building effective detection models.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

### [382] [Privacy-Preserving LLM Interaction with Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336)
*Yubeen Bae,Minchan Kim,Jaejin Lee,Sangbum Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Yejin Choi,Niloofar Mireshghallah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid system that combines the strengths of untrusted, powerful remote language models (like GPT-4) with smaller, trustworthy local models through Socratic Chain-of-Thought reasoning to ensure privacy while handling sensitive personal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between using untrusted, powerful language models for private data tasks (with high exposure risk) or using less capable but trusted local models.

Method: The system first uses a powerful, untrusted LLM for generic queries to generate detailed sub-queries. These are encrypted and processed using a Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database for semantic search among private data. Decrypted results are then used by a local LLM to generate final responses.

Result: This hybrid approach outperforms the standalone use of GPT-4 on the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark by up to 7.1 percentage points, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing privacy and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a step toward maintaining user privacy while leveraging the strengths of powerful remote LLMs in conjunction with local, secure models for sensitive data processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

*Valerii Gakh,Hayretdin Bahsi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study focuses on prompt injection attacks targeting LLM-based applications, comparing detection techniques in open-source solutions (LLM Guard, Vigil, Rebuff) and proposing improvements to enhance security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLM-based applications becoming more widespread, their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks poses a significant security risk, necessitating robust detection and mitigation strategies.

Method: The study evaluates and compares prompt leak detection techniques implemented in open-source solutions (LLM Guard, Vigil, Rebuff), analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and configurations in high-stakes scenarios.

Result: Performance analysis concludes that canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff are ineffective, improvements are proposed for these methods, and vulnerabilities in Rebuff’s secondary model-based techniques are identified and mitigated.

Conclusion: Vigil is optimal for scenarios requiring minimal false positives, while Rebuff is most suited for average cases. The study sheds light on vulnerabilities in current detection methods and offers direction for enhancements.

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper conducts a systematic literature review on Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), analyzing 65 key papers out of 397 collected, and introduces a novel taxonomy of approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern cyberattacks in CPS evolve rapidly, rendering traditional methods ineffective. The paper highlights the need for better approaches like AAD for adaptive and efficient detection.

Method: The authors perform a systematic literature review (SLR) on AAD in CPS from 2013 to 2023, collecting 397 papers and systematically analyzing 65 of them. They create a taxonomy based on attack types, CPS applications, learning paradigms, data management, and algorithms.

Result: The study finds that AAD research often focuses on either data processing or model adaptation, but rarely both. It identifies key limitations and gaps in the field.

Conclusion: The paper aims to advance AAD research, helping researchers and practitioners by summarizing progress, identifying limitations, and recommending directions for future studies.

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot
be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data
processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature
extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.
We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,
and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed
works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the
art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark evaluating synthetic image generation methods for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a systematic review and comparison of synthetic image generation methods, especially regarding their privacy and utility trade-offs in training classifiers.

Method: The paper categorizes synthetic image methods, privacy attacks, and mitigation strategies along the generation-sampling-classification pipeline. It benchmarks representative generative methods and assesses privacy risks using membership inference attacks (MIAs).

Result: The study answers critical questions related to synthetic data replacing real data, utility-privacy trade-offs, and optimal generative methods, providing actionable findings for data release strategies.

Conclusion: The research offers systematic insights into the utility-privacy trade-offs of synthetic data generation methods, serving as a guide for real-world applications.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image
generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field
lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation
methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic
images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of
generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides
actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data
generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies
for real-world applications.

*Ye Tian,Zhang Yumin,Yifan Jia,Jianguo Sun,Yanbin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WebGuard++ enhances malicious URL detection using novel URL-HTML feature fusion techniques, addressing key limitations in previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for malicious URL detection faced limitations such as incomplete URL modeling, limited interpretability, sparse HTML graph threats, and ignoring bidirectional interactions.

Method: WebGuard++ includes a Cross-scale URL Encoder, Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder, Bidirectional Coupling Module, and Voting Module for improved URL-HTML feature fusion and threat localization.

Result: WebGuard++ significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, showing a 1.1x-7.9x improvement in True Positive Rate at fixed False Positive Rate thresholds.

Conclusion: WebGuard++ provides robust and interpretable malicious URL detection by improving signal amplification, feature alignment, and regional threat localization methods.

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivacyXray is a framework designed to detect privacy breaches in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their internal states, achieving 92.69% accuracy across multiple LLMs and addressing the challenge of external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in sensitive areas like healthcare, finance, and legal services, leading to concerns about potential privacy leakage during their use.

Method: PrivacyXray employs semantic similarity and probabilistic metrics derived from the internal states of LLMs to detect privacy breaches, without relying on external datasets.

Result: PrivacyXray demonstrated an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs, surpassing existing methods by an accuracy increase of 20.06%.

Conclusion: PrivacyXray addresses the gaps in private information detection by utilizing an internal analysis mechanism, showcasing consistent performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

*Saeed Mahloujifar,Chuan Guo,G. Edward Suh,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper refines differential privacy (DP) into a more flexible framework, feature differential privacy (FDP), to improve utility in machine learning tasks while protecting specific attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP leads to unnecessary utility degradation when protecting only specific attributes while leaving others public.

Method: The paper introduces feature differential privacy (FDP), proves its theoretical properties, modifies DP-SGD to suit FDP, and applies it to machine learning tasks.

Result: FDP significantly improves DP-trained model utility, achieving a drastic improvement in metrics, such as FID on the AFHQ dataset, compared to standard DP.

Conclusion: The proposed FDP framework reduces utility costs of DP and provides strong privacy guarantees in targeted machine learning applications.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional keyword-based search engines struggle with addressing complex, multi-step queries; the paper aims to transcend these limitations with LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of Agentic Deep Research, integrating reasoning, iterative retrieval, and synthesis into a feedback loop, supported by empirical results and scaling laws.

Result: Agentic Deep Research significantly outperforms traditional methods in benchmarks and is supported by open-source implementations and industry resources.

Conclusion: The paradigm of Agentic Deep Research driven by LLMs is predicted to dominate future information-seeking approaches.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce IR systems face challenges in accurately interpreting complex user queries and efficiently processing vast product catalogs in real-time.

Method: NEAR$^2$, a Nested Embedding Approach, optimizes embedding size for inference while employing advanced loss functions like multiple negative ranking and online contrastive loss.

Result: NEAR$^2$ achieves up to 12 times efficiency in embedding size at inference time and improves accuracy across diverse encoder-based Transformer models tested on various datasets.

Conclusion: NEAR$^2$ represents a substantial advancement in e-commerce IR by balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing models with smaller embedding dimensions.

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommendation systems often inherit biases from user-sensitive features like gender and age, leading to fairness issues.

Method: The authors leverage Diffusion Models to inject controlled noise guided by sensitive feature recognition, followed by reverse denoising and multi-interest injection for bias elimination during training and inference.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show that FairGENRec improves both recommendation accuracy and fairness, with statistical analyses backing the claims.

Conclusion: FairGENRec is a promising framework to tackle fairness issues in recommendation systems while maintaining high-quality recommendations.

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses SQL debugging challenges using new benchmarks (BIRD-CRITIC), proposes improved models and methods, and presents Bird-Fixer, a superior open-source debugging agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text-to-SQL translation but struggle with debugging SQL issues. There is a need to enhance and evaluate SQL debugging capabilities rigorously.

Method: The paper introduces two SQL debugging benchmarks (BIRD-CRITIC), a training environment (Six-Gym), and f-Plan Boosting for extracting high-level debugging plans. These approaches aid in refining open-source models.

Result: Bird-Fixer, an open-source agent based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, surpasses leading proprietary models in debugging performance on the BIRD-CRITIC benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research advances SQL debugging by introducing benchmarks, methods, and models, marking progress toward more accessible and effective debugging tools for developers.

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

TL;DR: This paper introduces Higher-Order Graph Databases (HO-GDBs) to address limitations in traditional graph databases, enabling support for higher-order interactions crucial for complex analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph database systems lack support for higher-order interactions which are essential for tasks like subgraph counting and HO graph learning.

Method: The authors developed HO-GDBs using lifting and lowering paradigms and implemented a prototype system supporting hypergraphs, node-tuples, and other HO structures under a unified API.

Result: The prototype demonstrated scalability for large workloads and improved analytical tasks, such as boosting graph neural network accuracy by 44%.

Conclusion: HO-GDBs provide low latency, high throughput, and support both ACID-compliant and eventually consistent architectures, establishing a foundation for advanced graph analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.
