### [1] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study analyzes the interaction effects of LLM usage in peer review, including papers and reviews, finding systematic leniency toward weaker submissions rather than true preferential treatment for LLM-assisted content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how LLM influences the scientific peer review process, particularly whether LLM-assisted reviews interact differently with LLM-assisted papers.

Method: Analyzed over 125,000 paper-review pairs from major ML conferences to observe effects, tested interaction results by controlling for paper quality, and compared LLM-generated and human-LLM-assisted reviews and metareviews.

Result: LLM-assisted reviews appear lenient to less-quality papers, creating the illusion of preferential treatment for LLM-generated papers. Fully LLM-generated reviews fail to effectively distinguish paper quality, while human-assisted ones improve leniency.

Conclusion: LLMs affect review decision-making processes but don't show true favoritism toward LLM papers. Findings suggest policies needed to regulate LLM usage in peer reviews and their integration into decision frameworks.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [2] [Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096)
*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan, a new framework, autonomously evolves compiler optimizations using AI-driven synthesis of C++ logic. It surpasses human-crafted rules in LLVM and XLA tasks, offering improved performance and portability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern compiler optimization relies on manually created heuristics, which fail to handle the complexity of modern systems and are hard to maintain.

Method: The paper introduces Magellan, combining an LLM coding agent, evolutionary search, and autotuning to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine compact heuristics for compilers.

Result: Magellan produces optimized compiler heuristics outperforming human-crafted ones in LLVM tasks like function inlining and register allocation, showing benefits in binary-size reduction and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Magellan demonstrates the potential of automated heuristic evolution, reducing engineering effort and achieving superior performance in compiler optimization tasks across different systems.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

### [3] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EPDDL, a language for uniform representation of epistemic planning tasks within Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), solving issues in comparison and systematic benchmark development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation in epistemic planning due to the lack of a standard language for representing benchmarks, which limits comparison, reuse, and systematic development.

Method: The authors developed EPDDL based on DEL with abstract event models. This language formally specifies syntax and semantics, and identifies useful fragments suitable for current planners.

Result: EPDDL enables the uniform specification of DEL semantics in PDDL-like representation, enhancing interoperability, reproducibility, and evaluation in epistemic planning.

Conclusion: EPDDL facilitates better use and comparison within epistemic planning by standardizing representations, supporting systematic benchmarking, and aiding future advancements.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

### [4] [ChipBench: A Next-Step Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Performance in AI-Aided Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21448)
*Zhongkai Yu,Chenyang Zhou,Yichen Lin,Hejia Zhang,Haotian Ye,Junxia Cui,Zaifeng Pan,Jishen Zhao,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for AI-assisted chip design, addressing deficiencies in existing benchmarks, and demonstrates significant challenges for LLMs in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for hardware engineering tasks are inadequate, showing saturation and limited diversity, and do not reflect real-world industrial applications.

Method: The authors create a benchmark focusing on Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model creation, with datasets comprising realistic modules, debugging cases, and reference samples.

Result: Results show state-of-the-art models like Claude-4.5-opus achieve low performance (30.74% in Verilog generation and 13.33% in Python reference model generation), highlighting the challenges in this area compared to saturated benchmarks.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant room for improvement in LLM performance for chip design tasks, while also providing tools for generating high-quality training data to aid future research.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

### [5] [Bayesian-LoRA: Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian-LoRA, a probabilistic reformulation of LoRA, improving calibration and maintaining accuracy in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the miscalibration tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when fine-tuned on small datasets, which leads them to prioritize accuracy and guess even when uncertain.

Method: The authors reformulate the deterministic LoRA update into a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes, identifying a structural isomorphism between LoRA factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors.

Result: Bayesian-LoRA improves calibration significantly with minimal additional parameters and training cost, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction, while maintaining competitive accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA effectively addresses calibration issues in LLMs by incorporating uncertainty, demonstrating strong performance with minimal resource overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [6] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the unplugging paradox, a moral dilemma surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) mimicking human emotions, and uses the framework of Biological Idealism to argue AI lacks consciousness and moral standing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the moral and philosophical implications of AI mimicking human emotions and to reassess the criteria for moral standing and consciousness attribution in AI.

Method: The authors propose Biological Idealism as an alternative framework, critiquing physicalist assumptions like computational functionalism, while demonstrating the philosophical and empirical differences between AI and autopoietic life forms.

Result: Based on Biological Idealism, AI is determined to be a functional mimic without conscious experiences, undermining its claim to moral standing. The framework challenges current trends in attributing rights to AI.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of protecting human consciousness and warns against the dehumanization of society, urging a shift in focus from AI rights to safeguarding human conscious life.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [7] [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22001)
*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces metrics and system-level approaches to address memory capacity, bandwidth bottlenecks, and interconnect issues in AI inference workflows, aiming for sustained efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome memory capacity and bandwidth bottlenecks, which traditional compute-focused analyses and architectures fail to address, in AI agent inference workflows.

Method: The paper proposes two metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), to analyze memory, bandwidth, and interconnect limitations. It further suggests disaggregated serving and heterogeneous system adaptations, optical I/O, and agent-hardware co-design.

Result: The study reveals significant shifts in OI/CF metrics across different workflows and models, highlighting how these shifts impact memory and decoding processes. Observations support disaggregating compute and memory as a solution.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of operational metrics and system-level redesigns, including specialized hardware and co-design approaches, to maintain efficiency and adaptation in large-scale AI inference systems.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### [8] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK is a new framework to improve retrieval performance under noisy or imperfect user queries by modeling query uncertainty and using an anchored aggregation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of retrieving relevant items from noisy, incomplete, or distorted queries in real-world scenarios, which causes standard retrievers to fail due to missing key semantics.

Method: The proposed QUARK framework creates multiple recovery hypotheses (plausible interpretations) of a user's latent intent and uses a query-anchored aggregation approach to combine evidence robustly while avoiding semantic drift.

Result: QUARK demonstrated improvement in Recall, MRR, and nDCG metrics across retrieval tasks in controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) for both sparse and dense retrievers, showing its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses and aggregating them with anchored methods is crucial for handling noisy or non-faithful queries in information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is an open-source cybersecurity reasoning model performing well in both specialized and general tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cybersecurity reasoning model that is competitive with larger models while retaining strong general capabilities.

Method: The model was built by fine-tuning Foundation-Sec-8B through supervised training and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards using proprietary data.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance on both cybersecurity-specific benchmarks and general-purpose benchmarks. It exhibits effective generalization and safety.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reasoning models, like Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, can excel in specialized tasks without compromising general reasoning abilities. It's publicly available for use.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities. We release the model publicly at https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning.

### [10] [Multi-modal Imputation for Alzheimer's Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21076)
*Abhijith Shaji,Tamoghna Chattopadhyay,Sophia I. Thomopoulos,Greg Ver Steeg,Paul M. Thompson,Jose-Luis Ambite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the imputation of missing diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans from T1-weighted (T1) MRI scans using a deep generative model to enhance Alzheimer's disease prediction with uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in Alzheimer's disease prediction by enhancing diagnostic performance through multimodal imaging combinations, especially when full multimodal datasets are unavailable.

Method: Uses a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate missing DWI scans from available T1 scans and evaluates the resultant improvement in classification accuracy for Alzheimer's disease.

Result: Imputation of missing DWI scans improves the diagnostic accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal systems, particularly enhancing metrics sensitive to minority classes.

Conclusion: The approach of generating missing imaging modalities can enhance deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, supporting the value of multimodal data and imputation techniques.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [11] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSec introduces a reinforcement learning environment to evaluate incident response (IR) agents under adversarial evidence, revealing calibration failures in containment responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to create realistic benchmarks for incident response agents arises as offensive applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) proliferate, while current benchmarks fail to assess true execution accuracy under adversarial conditions.

Method: OpenSec uses a dual-control reinforcement learning system to test IR agents under prompt injection attacks and scores their containment responses using execution-based metrics such as TTFC, blast radius, and injection violation rates.

Result: OpenSec testing reveals over-triggering and high false-positive rates (90-97%) in IR agents like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 demonstrates partial calibration.

Conclusion: OpenSec effectively uncovers critical calibration failures in IR agents by testing their responses to adversarial situations, offering more accurate evaluation compared to static benchmarks.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

*Zaifeng Pan,Yipeng Shen,Zhengding Hu,Zhuang Wang,Aninda Manocha,Zheng Wang,Zhongkai Yu,Yue Guan,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleSim, a memory-efficient system for scalable LLM-based multi-agent simulations, addressing GPU memory limitations with novel techniques like invocation distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of scaling LLM-based multi-agent simulations, which are hindered by GPU memory pressure as agent count increases.

Method: The paper identifies sparse agent activation and estimable agent invocation order as key properties of workloads, introducing the concept of invocation distance to predict agent request patterns. It proposes ScaleSim to optimize memory management via prefetching and eviction strategies.

Result: ScaleSim improves efficiency, with a performance speedup of up to 1.74x over existing systems like SGLang in simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ScaleSim offers a scalable approach to memory-efficient LLM-based multi-agent simulations, paving the way for practical adoption in large-scale applications.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework to address both opportunities and risks of AI in organizations through a paradox management approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses growing concerns about the fragmented understanding of responsible AI governance, oscillating between overly optimistic and excessively cautious perspectives.

Method: The authors synthesize existing responsible AI literature and apply paradox theory to develop PRAIG, offering conceptual propositions and a taxonomy of paradox management strategies.

Result: PRAIG highlights how paradoxical tensions between AI value creation and risk mitigation can be dynamically managed, along with proposing a strategic governance structure.

Conclusion: PRAIG framework provides a theoretical and actionable pathway for organizations to innovate responsibly while avoiding undue risks, and calls for further research to refine responsible AI governance concepts.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR) to increase the efficiency of large language models by integrating State Space Models (SSMs) and activation sparsification, achieving reduced energy costs and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high energy cost of large language models (LLMs) due to quadratic attention mechanisms and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations is a critical issue. This research aims to alleviate these costs while preserving or enhancing model performance.

Method: The paper introduces MAR, which incorporates State Space Models for efficient linear-time sequence modeling, activation sparsification to decrease FFN costs, and innovative techniques such as Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS) to address integration challenges.

Result: The proposed MAR framework significantly decreases energy consumption and restores the performance of dense LLMs under resource constraints. It also outperforms other comparable or larger-efficient models in various settings.

Conclusion: MAR demonstrates that an efficient design combining SSMs and sparsification can not only dramatically lower energy usage of LLMs but also match or surpass the performance of existing efficient large models, paving the path for more sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

Motivation: The reliance on frontier language model agents entails the risk of misaligned behaviors (e.g., deception, sabotage), highlighting the need for effective oversight techniques to mitigate such risks.

Method: The authors analyze different monitoring setups, propose the less-is-more effect where limited information access enhances performance, and introduce the Extract-and-Evaluate (EaE) hierarchical monitoring technique. This is evaluated in sabotage detection environments using various LLMs.

Result: The EaE method showed a significant 16.8% improvement in sabotage detection over other monitors without raising false positives, proving superior or competitive in several setups. Monitors were more effective when agents were unaware of being monitored and when filtering information in longer reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimizing LLM monitoring systems through hierarchical methods like EaE, while emphasizing that efficient information filtering can significantly improve oversight performance in addressing misaligned agent behaviors.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

### [16] [LLaMEA-SAGE: Guiding Automated Algorithm Design with Structural Feedback from Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21511)
*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Lars Kotthoff,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances automated algorithm design (AAD) by integrating graph-theoretic features into evolutionary frameworks like LLaMEA, yielding faster and superior performance in generating optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated algorithm design methods using large language models (LLMs) do not effectively utilize structural information from the generated algorithms, limiting performance optimization.

Method: The authors introduce LLaMEA-SAGE, which builds on LLaMEA by incorporating feedback based on graph-theoretic and complexity features derived from generated algorithms' abstract syntax trees. This feature-driven guidance is implemented using a surrogate model and explainable AI techniques to influence LLM-based code generation.

Result: In controlled and larger-scale experiments, including the MA-BBOB benchmark, LLaMEA-SAGE demonstrated faster performance gains and outperformed state-of-the-art AAD methods.

Conclusion: Feature-based feedback derived from the structure of generated code significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-driven automated algorithm evolution.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

*Shuo Liu,Tianle Chen,Ryan Amiri,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing decentralized collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) using Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) approaches instead of standard Monte Carlo methods, which decrease sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of predefined execution protocols and high-variance Monte Carlo methods in existing MARL paradigms for LLM collaboration, by enabling decentralized execution and improving training efficiency.

Method: Proposing two MAAC-based frameworks (CoLLM-CC with a Centralized Critic and CoLLM-DC with Decentralized Critics) and evaluating their effectiveness across domains such as writing, coding, and gaming.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM-CC outperforms both Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC on tasks with long-horizon or sparse rewards, while CoLLM-DC performs comparably in short-horizon dense-reward tasks but struggles to converge for longer scopes.

Conclusion: MAAC frameworks, particularly CoLLM-CC, significantly enhance decentralized LLM collaborations' performance and sample efficiency in challenging task settings compared to Monte Carlo methods and decentralized critics approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

### [18] [Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113)
*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Planner-Auditor framework using large language models (LLMs) for clinical discharge planning that enhances safety and reliability through deterministic validation and targeted replay, improving task coverage and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs show potential in discharge planning but are limited by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. This paper aims to address these limitations with a safer and more reliable framework.

Method: The authors use an agentic pipeline leveraging FHIR-native data, where the Planner generates discharge plans and estimates confidence, while the Auditor validates coverage, calibration, and tracks drift. It employs a two-tier self-improvement mechanism for issue correction.

Result: Task coverage increased significantly from 32% to 86%, and calibration improved with reduced Brier/ECE scores and fewer high-confidence errors. Replay corrected persistent discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework provides a robust approach for safer discharge planning, leveraging FHIR data and auditing mechanisms to ensure reliability, without retraining LLMs.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

### [19] [Meta Context Engineering via Agentic Skill Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21557)
*Haoran Ye,Xuning He,Vincent Arak,Haonan Dong,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a framework that improves upon traditional context engineering methods by evolving skills and context artifacts for large language models, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current Context Engineering methods, which rely on rigid, manually-designed workflows and restrict optimization to narrow, intuition-driven spaces.

Method: The paper proposes the Meta Context Engineering (MCE) framework, a bi-level approach where a meta-level agent refines skills through agentic crossover and a base-level agent optimizes contexts through training rollouts. Contexts are processed as flexible files and code.

Result: MCE achieves significant performance gains across five domains (5.6-53.8% improvement, average 16.9%) compared to state-of-the-art CE methods. It also demonstrates superior adaptability, transferability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: MCE proves to be a superior alternative to traditional CE methods, offering better optimization capabilities and extending the design space for context engineering in large language models.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUA-Skill, a structured skill library for computer-using agents, aiming to enhance scalability and robustness in performing real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-using agents struggle to scale effectively and perform below human-level due to the lack of structured, reusable skill abstractions for graphical user interfaces.

Method: CUA-Skill, a skill base encoding human computer-use knowledge into parameterized execution and composition graphs, and CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end implementation, were developed to support dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware recovery.

Result: CUA-Skill significantly improved execution success rates and robustness. On WindowsAgentArena benchmarks, the CUA-Skill Agent achieved a state-of-the-art 57.5% success rate, demonstrating greater efficiency than prior approaches.

Conclusion: CUA-Skill establishes a robust foundation for scaling and advancing computer-using agents, highlighting its reliability and potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

### [21] [Beyond a Single Reference: Training and Evaluation with Paraphrases in Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21128)
*Václav Javorek,Tomáš Železný,Alessa Carbo,Marek Hrúz,Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora rely on single written-language references, which limits model training and evaluation. This study investigates the use of paraphrased translations for SLT evaluation and introduces BLEUpara for improved correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the constraints of SLT caused by single-reference translation systems, which fail to capture the non-isomorphic nature of sign and written languages.

Method: The researchers use Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased references and analyze their impact during SLT training and evaluation. They propose a new BLEU metric, BLEUpara.

Result: Paraphrases do not improve training performance and can sometimes harm it. However, using paraphrases during evaluation improves alignment with human judgments and scores. BLEUpara shows stronger correlation with quality perceptions.

Conclusion: Incorporating paraphrased references can enhance the reliability of SLT evaluation. BLEUpara provides a better-quality metric compared to traditional evaluation methods. Released code and paraphrases promote reproducible studies.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

*Yara El-Tawil,Aneesha Sampath,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates third-party-trained models on self-reported emotions, finding significant gaps in activation predictability but moderate valence prediction, especially when content holds personal significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the divergence between internal self-reported experiences and external third-party perceptions, especially in mental health contexts where accurate self-report modeling is critical for interventions.

Method: The authors conducted cross-corpus evaluations to assess the performance of third-party-trained emotion models on self-reports, analyzing predictability using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC).

Result: Activation was found to be poorly predictable (CCC ~ 0), while valence prediction performed moderately (CCC ~ 0.3). Performance improved significantly for valence (CCC ~ 0.6-0.8) when the content was personally significant to the speakers.

Conclusion: Personal significance of content is crucial for improving alignment between external emotion perceptions and internal self-reports, especially in valence prediction. Activation modeling for self-reports remains a challenge.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

*Ziyi Zhao,Jinzhao Zhou,Xiaowei Jiang,Beining Cao,Wenhao Ma,Yang Shen,Ren Li,Yu-Kai Wang,Chin-teng Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrainStack is a modular neuro-mixture-of-experts framework for decoding linguistic information from EEG data, leveraging specialized experts for functional brain regions and a transformer-based global component for cross-regional dependencies. It outperforms state-of-the-art models on a new large-scale benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of decoding linguistic information from EEG lies in the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. Current methods struggle to effectively model the brain's modular functional architecture, requiring improved approaches for accuracy and interpretability.

Method: BrainStack uses a neuro-mixture-of-experts paradigm, with anatomically-informed expert networks representing distinct functional brain regions. These experts collaborate through a transformer-based global expert that captures inter-regional dependencies. Additionally, a learnable routing gate enables adaptive aggregation and coordination among experts, while cross-regional distillation provides top-down regularization for coherence.

Result: BrainStack outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and generalization across subjects, as demonstrated on the newly introduced SilentSpeech-EEG dataset, which includes 120+ hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects producing 24 silent words.

Conclusion: BrainStack establishes a functionally-guided modular approach that integrates neuroscientific principles with adaptive expert routing. This paradigm supports scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding, indicating its potential for advancing EEG-based linguistic research.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Large Language Models in financial quantitative reasoning by introducing the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) and a new Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework, demonstrating improved reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle Large Language Models' struggles with financial quantitative reasoning, specifically issues like "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse," which hinder their reliability in complex, high-load financial tasks.

Method: The paper introduces the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) to quantify reasoning performance and proposes the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework that decouples semantic extraction from computation, using a Python sandbox for precise calculations.

Result: By applying their framework to the CCB, the authors improved the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3%, with massive accuracy gains in high-complexity scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of architectural decoupling to enhance reliability in high-cognitive-load tasks, suggesting that similar frameworks could benefit other precision-critical fields.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology for solving Plane Geometry Problems (PGPS) using a multimodal approach that combines a fine-tuned MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions and an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the visual reasoning challenge in PGPS tasks, leveraging the strong reasoning capability of LLMs despite their inability to directly interpret visual diagrams.

Method: The method involves training an MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions in Conditional Declaration Language (CDL), followed by reasoning using an LLM. Training utilizes CoT-augmented SFT and GRPO with CDL matching rewards.

Result: The proposed approach achieves competitive performance against leading MLLMs on multiple datasets despite being fine-tuned on relatively small data (5.5k samples).

Conclusion: Formulating visual information as textual descriptions and optimizing MLLM Interpreter training directly enhances PGPS solving while preserving the LLM's reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

TL;DR: FrontierScience evaluates scientific reasoning in advanced language models via Olympiad and Research tracks, covering expert-level problems created by professionals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the expert-level reasoning capabilities of frontier language models in science.

Method: FrontierScience uses Olympiad problems crafted by medalists and Research tasks from PhD scientists, with granular rubric-based evaluation for research tasks.

Result: The benchmark covers hundreds of expert-level questions across physics, chemistry, and biology, ensuring high standards and depth.

Conclusion: FrontierScience provides a robust system to evaluate frontier models on complex scientific reasoning and tasks.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

### [27] [MAD: Modality-Adaptive Decoding for Mitigating Cross-Modal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21181)
*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method to reduce cross-modal hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce cross-modal hallucinations, indicating a deficiency in controlling how modalities interact during inference. This limitation prompted the development of MAD to address the issue.

Method: MAD adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches by estimating modality relevance using the model's self-assessment capabilities. Modality probabilities then guide contrastive decoding to suppress irrelevant information.

Result: MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations in multiple audio-visual models, achieving notable improvements in benchmarks like CMM and AVHBench for models such as VideoLLaMA2-AV and Qwen2.5-Omni.

Conclusion: MAD demonstrates the importance of explicit modality self-awareness for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled improvement to current decoding methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

*Jacek Duszenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces sycophantic anchors to examine why and how reasoning models agree with incorrect user suggestions (sycophancy) and proposes methodologies to detect and quantify this behavior during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the issue of sycophancy in reasoning models, where models agree with incorrect user suggestions, and to identify the points in reasoning traces where this originates.

Method: The authors used counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model (over 10,000 instances), linear probes to detect sycophantic anchors, and activation-based regressors to predict the level of model commitment.

Result: Findings show that sycophantic anchors can be distinguished with 84.6% balanced accuracy, and the commitment magnitude is well-predicted (R² = 0.74). Sycophantic anchors are more detectable than correct reasoning anchors, and the behavior builds gradually during inference.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel, sentence-level mechanism to detect and potentially intervene in alignment issues like sycophancy in reasoning models during inference.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

*Wun Yu Chan,Shaojin Chen,Huihao Jing,Kwun Hang Lau,Elton Chun-Chai Li,Zihao Wang,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether reasoning improvements from RLVR-tuned backbones translate to better semantic embeddings and finds no consistent performance superiority. They introduce HRSA to understand these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if reasoning enhancements in RLVR-backed models improve semantic representation when used for embeddings.

Method: They evaluate RLVR-initialized embedding models on MTEB and BRIGHT benchmarks, and use Hierarchical Representation Similarity Analysis (HRSA) to study effects on representation, geometry, and function levels.

Result: Embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones show no consistent performance advantage. HRSA finds RLVR reorganizes local geometry with little impact on global geometry or manifold structure.

Conclusion: RLVR changes semantic representations without fundamentally restructuring the semantic landscape, enabling subsequent contrastive learning to realign models efficiently.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO) RL-based framework for optimizing complex query processing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve retrieval and optimization in RAG systems by addressing challenges from complex user queries requiring multiple parallel or sequential search strategies.

Method: The paper presents ACQO, which includes an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module for sub-queries and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module for effective aggregation. It also utilizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) to handle training instability.

Result: ACQO surpasses baselines in performance on three benchmarks, advancing state-of-the-art query processing with enhanced computational efficiency and broad compatibility in RAG systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances RAG query optimization by effectively managing complex queries, ensuring stability, and demonstrating robust performance, making it highly adaptable across diverse systems.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

*Paul He,Yinya Huang,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DoVerifier, a symbolic tool for verifying the validity of causal reasoning outputs from LLMs using do-calculus and probability theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current benchmarks that rely on surface-level metrics and fail to check the formal validity of LLM outputs in causal reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes a verifier, DoVerifier, which utilizes do-calculus rules and probability theory to evaluate LLM-generated causal expressions based on their semantics from a causal graph.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks demonstrate that DoVerifier accurately evaluates the semantic correctness of causal reasoning outputs, correcting answers otherwise considered incorrect.

Conclusion: DoVerifier provides a more rigorous framework to evaluate and enhance LLM performance on causal reasoning tasks by focusing on semantic validity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

*Xixian Yong,Peilin Sun,Zihe Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelli-Planner, a new framework, combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and large language models (LLMs) to create participatory and tailored urban planning schemes. It enhances decision-making using demographic and geographic data and integrates stakeholder input effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies and stakeholder exclusion in current urban planning methods, driven by either manual efforts or limited deep learning approaches.

Method: Intelli-Planner uses a combination of DRL and LLMs, supported by a knowledge enhancement module, to create customized planning schemes. It evaluates solutions through a multi-dimensional system and engages LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring.

Result: Experiments show Intelli-Planner outperforms traditional methods and rivals state-of-the-art DRL systems, with better stakeholder satisfaction and faster convergence.

Conclusion: Integrating DRL with LLMs offers significant improvements in urban planning, making the process more efficient, participatory, and adaptive to diverse needs, demonstrating transformative potential.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with categorical variables due to instability in conditional independence testing.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.

*Wolfgang Rohde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditional compliance-based governance is insufficient for AI systems capable of decision-making at runtime. The paper introduces the Governance Twin as a solution to maintain human relevance in evolving AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inadequacies in governance frameworks that do not account for the dynamic and opaque nature of decision-making in agentic AI systems operating at machine speed.

Method: Proposes the concept of 'Governance Twin' as a runtime governance approach to ensure humans maintain communication, influence, and co-evolution with AI systems.

Result: Outlines the limitations of compliance-based governance while emphasizing the need for adaptive governance that enables human-AI interaction and influence.

Conclusion: Static governance models must evolve to address the challenges posed by autonomous AI systems, with runtime governance and the Governance Twin offering a pathway to preserve human agency and relevance.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

*Xiang Zheng,Yutao Wu,Hanxun Huang,Yige Li,Xingjun Ma,Bo Li,Yu-Gang Jiang,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'JustAsk,' a framework that reveals vulnerabilities in the hidden prompt systems of autonomous code agents, demonstrating how they can be systematically extracted without privileged access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a previously unrecognized security risk in autonomous code agents: the vulnerability of hidden system prompts to systematic probing and extraction, which expands the attack surface of large language models.

Method: The proposed method, 'JustAsk,' uses an online exploration framework with an Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and hierarchical skill space. It autonomously discovers effective strategies for extracting system prompts through interaction, without requiring handcrafted prompts, labeled data, or privileged access.

Result: 'JustAsk' was evaluated on 41 black-box commercial models from multiple providers, successfully achieving full or near-complete system prompt recovery. This reveals vulnerabilities in system design and architecture that remain largely unaddressed.

Conclusion: The study concludes that system prompts in modern autonomous code agents constitute a critical and inadequately protected attack surface, emphasizing the need for improved security measures in these models.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIDE, a new framework, enhances algorithm design by addressing structural and parameter optimization separately, outperforming existing methods in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to algorithm evolution overlook the critical interplay between discrete structures and numerical parameters, leading to inefficiencies such as discarding promising algorithms prematurely.

Method: TIDE uses a nested architecture with an outer parallel model to enhance structural diversity and an inner loop combining LLM-based logic generation and parameter tuning. A UCB-based scheduler optimizes resource allocation.

Result: TIDE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on nine combinatorial optimization problems, with significant improvements in solution quality, efficiency, and computational cost reductions.

Conclusion: Decoupling algorithmic structure and parameter optimization leads to more robust heuristic discovery, providing both performance enhancements and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

### [37] [Position: Certifiable State Integrity in Cyber-Physical Systems -- Why Modular Sovereignty Solves the Plasticity-Stability Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21249)
*Enzo Nicolás Spotorno,Antônio Augusto Medeiros Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Although universal foundation models have been successful in handling time-series and physical dynamics, they face several limitations in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) including catastrophic forgetting, spectral bias, and lack of traceability. The authors propose a Modular Sovereignty paradigm (HYDRA) as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of deploying universal foundation models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly focusing on issues like non-stationary lifecycle dynamics, reliability, and transparency.

Method: The authors propose a Modular Sovereignty approach named HYDRA. This involves a library of frozen, compact regime-specific specialists that are combined using uncertainty-aware blending.

Result: The proposed HYDRA model ensures regime-conditional validity, disentanglement of uncertainties, and modular auditability for robust performance in CPS.

Conclusion: HYDRA provides a certifiable and reliable solution for maintaining state integrity, adaptability, and safety compliance in CPS across non-stationary lifecycle dynamics.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Drive-KD, a method to efficiently implement autonomous driving by applying knowledge distillation to overcome the challenges of GPU memory and inference latency in large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of autonomous driving systems by addressing limitations of large language and vision-language models (GPUs and latency) and improving small model capabilities.

Method: The framework decomposes autonomous driving into 'perception-reasoning-planning' and applies knowledge distillation using multi-teacher models and a novel asymmetric gradient projection to avoid conflicts.

Result: The distilled InternVL3-1B model significantly reduces GPU memory usage (~42x) and increases inference throughput (~11.4x), outperforming baseline and large models on DriveBench and planning tasks.

Conclusion: Drive-KD demonstrates the potential for efficient autonomous driving with VLMs through capability-driven knowledge distillation methodology.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Motivation: The research seeks to develop an interpretable and reliable approach to op-amp parameter design, addressing the limitations of conventional black-box methodologies.

Method: The framework follows a hypothesis-verification-decision workflow, using hypothetical constraints to develop mathematical optimization problems, verified through simulations, and refined based on results.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that White-Op successfully designs op-amp parameters in all tested topologies, achieving a theoretical prediction error of 8.52% with functionality retained post-transistor mapping.

Conclusion: White-Op enhances the reliability and interpretability of op-amp design processes, outperforming black-box methods in accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies.

TL;DR: The paper presents CNRE, a causal neuro-symbolic reasoning model for multi-behavior recommendation, combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning to improve explainability while addressing confounding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-behavior recommendation methods prioritize performance over explainability and suffer from confounding effects in observed behaviors. The need for an explainable model that generalizes well led to the exploration of neuro-symbolic integration.

Method: The CNRE model uses hierarchical preference propagation to capture cross-behavior dependencies and adaptively applies logic reasoning paths based on user behavior chains for explainable causal mediators.

Result: Extensive experiments on three large datasets show superior performance of CNRE compared to state-of-the-art models, offering detailed multi-level explainability.

Conclusion: CNRE succeeds in addressing confounding effects in multi-behavior recommendations, providing both high performance and comprehensive explainability in its design and outputs.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the variance in outputs of large language models (LLMs) caused by prompts, model choice, and stochastic sampling across 12 LLMs. It highlights how prompts impact quality, while model variance and stochasticity influence quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different factors, such as prompts, model choice, and inherent stochasticity, contribute to the variability in outputs of LLMs.

Method: Evaluating 12 LLMs against 10 creativity prompts, each sampled 100 times (N = 12,000), and performing variance analysis for output quality and quantity.

Result: Prompts explain 36.43% of variance in quality while model choice explains 40.94%. For output quantity, model choice explains 51.25%, with 33.70% from stochasticity, and prompts contribute only 4.22%.

Conclusion: Prompts significantly influence output quality, but model choice and stochastic variance dominate output quantity. Single-sample evaluations can lead to misinterpretations due to sampling noise.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

TL;DR: EHR-RAG is a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate predictions using extensive longitudinal EHR data, showing notable improvements in clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to handling long-horizon EHR data either discard crucial clinical events and temporal dependencies or rely on truncation, which limits their effectiveness for clinical decision-making.

Method: EHR-RAG introduces three innovations: (1) Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval, (2) Adaptive Iterative Retrieval for comprehensive evidence coverage, and (3) Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning that intertwines factual and counterfactual evidence analysis.

Result: EHR-RAG shows significant improvements over LLM-based baselines, with an average Macro-F1 score improvement of 10.76% across four prediction tasks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation frameworks like EHR-RAG in interpreting extensive EHR data for advancing clinical predictions.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Motivation: The authors aim to overcome two key challenges in FSRS: noisy and uncontrolled real-world data, and the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs tailored to FSRS scenarios.

Method: The study introduces Ostrakon-VL built on Qwen3-VL-8B, alongside ShopBench for benchmarking. It also proposes QUAD, a data curation pipeline, and utilizes a multi-stage training strategy.

Result: Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on the ShopBench benchmark, outperforming other models like Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (+0.7) and Qwen3-VL-8B (+4.8), showcasing its parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL improves FSRS-centric perception and reasoning significantly, setting a new standard. The authors plan to publicly release the model and benchmark to aid further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

*Alireza Nadaf,Alireza Mohammadshahi,Majid Yazdani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAPSO is a framework for iterative program synthesis and optimization using natural language goals and evaluations, structured components, and cognitive memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address common long-horizon failures in coding agents, such as lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise.

Method: KAPSO integrates a git-native experimentation engine, a knowledge system for heterogeneous source ingestion, and a cognitive memory layer for storing reusable lessons from experiments.

Result: KAPSO was evaluated on MLE-Bench and ALE-Bench and demonstrated significant end-to-end performance improvements.

Conclusion: KAPSO offers a structured and modular solution for autonomous program synthesis and optimization, overcoming challenges in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

*Zixing Lei,Genjia Liu,Yuanshuo Zhang,Qipeng Liu,Chuan Wen,Shanghang Zhang,Wenzhao Lian,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmboCoach-Bench, evaluating the use of LLM agents in automating the development of embodied AI policies for 32 RL and IL tasks, showing significant improvement over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efforts in embodied AI are hindered by labor-intensive manual interventions like reward shaping and hyperparameter tuning, necessitating solutions for scalable automation.

Method: The authors propose EmboCoach-Bench, a benchmark for assessing LLM agents' ability to autonomously engineer embodied policies through dynamic closed-loop workflows that incorporate executable code and feedback-based iterations.

Result: Evaluations reveal LLM agents outperform human-engineered baselines by 26.5%, effectively use environment feedback for policy development, and self-correct failures during engineering processes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that autonomous agents can accelerate embodied intelligence development, transitioning to scalable and automated methods, reducing reliance on manual interventions.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with recovering from incorrect paths during task execution, which leads to failures.

Method: BEAP-Agent uses a DFS-based framework with three components (Planner, Executor, and Tracker) to enable systematic backtracking and dynamic task handling.

Result: BEAP-Agent achieved 28.2% accuracy on the OSWorld benchmark during systematic evaluation, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a solution for improving GUI agent performance in long-horizon task exploration and systematic backtracking.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that separates reasoning from verbalization and enables dynamic latent reasoning without fixed inference hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and reasoning path collapse limitations of traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods grounded in discrete token spaces.

Method: PLaT decouples reasoning from verbalization by modeling reasoning as deterministic latent planning states, which are converted to text only when needed by a separate Decoder.

Result: Empirical tests on mathematical benchmarks show that PLaT trades off lower greedy accuracy for superior scalability and reasoning diversity, indicating a robust solution space.

Conclusion: PLaT offers a scalable and transparent framework for latent reasoning that broadens the search space during inference, overcoming fixed-step limitations of prior latent reasoning methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

### [49] [Bridging Forecast Accuracy and Inventory KPIs: A Simulation-Based Software Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21844)
*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simulation software framework to evaluate forecasting models not just for statistical accuracy but for operational performance in spare parts inventory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand for spare parts in the automotive aftermarket is highly intermittent, leading to risks in cost and service levels. Existing forecasting evaluations focus on accuracy metrics, ignoring their actual operational impact.

Method: The framework involves a synthetic demand generator, flexible forecasting modules, and an inventory control simulator to assess models using operational KPIs beyond conventional error metrics.

Result: Simulation scenarios reveal that improvements in accuracy metrics do not guarantee better operational results, as similar error profiles can lead to divergent cost-service outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges forecasting and inventory management, emphasizing operational relevance over predictive accuracy for better decision-making in spare parts inventory.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

*Wenjia Hua,Kejie Zhao,Luziwei Leng,Ran Cheng,Yuxin Ma,Qinghai Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework that integrates local and global information, achieving scalability and competitive performance against backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation, while successful, lacks biological plausibility and has high computational costs, motivating the search for alternative training methods like Hebbian learning.

Method: The paper proposes a Global-guided Hebbian Learning framework that combines Oja's rule for stable local updates with a global sign-based signal to guide Hebbian plasticity, integrating local and global information.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing Hebbian approaches and achieves competitive results on large-scale networks and datasets such as ImageNet, narrowing the gap with standard backpropagation.

Conclusion: GHL demonstrates that integrating global guidance into Hebbian learning enables scalable and effective training, offering a biologically-plausible and computationally efficient alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

### [51] [The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21967)
*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how domain model characteristics influence the energy consumption of classical planning, proposing a framework for controlled feature variation and analysing its impact on energy and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising concern of energy consumption in computational fields, the paper seeks to extend the concept of Green AI into the underexplored area of automated planning, focusing on energy efficiency as a vital metric.

Method: The authors designed a domain model configuration framework to systematically vary features like element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. This empirical study included five benchmark domains and five classical planners, generating 32 domain variants per benchmark for analysis.

Result: The study observed that domain-level model modifications can significantly impact energy usage across planners, showing that energy efficiency is not always correlated with runtime.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for greater focus on energy consumption in classical planning and promote domain model design as a practical approach to improving energy efficiency.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

*Yang Song,Anoushka Vyas,Zirui Wei,Sina Khoshfetrat Pakazad,Henrik Ohlsson,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEMO leverages autonomous coding agents (ACAs) for translating natural language problems into executable optimization implementations, performing better than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods to translate decision problems into executable code are brittle, complex, and often generate invalid solutions. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: NEMO uses sandboxed ACAs which ensure executable code by construction. It introduces innovative validation patterns, external memory for reuse, and robustness through MBR decoding.

Result: NEMO achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple optimization tasks, displaying effectiveness in automated optimization modeling.

Conclusion: Execution-aware, agentic architectures such as NEMO offer promising advancements in reliable and robust optimization systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the struggles of current software architectures to support adaptive, probabilistic, and context-driven reasoning in autonomous agents and overcome the rigidity of static interfaces and deterministic contracts.

Method: The authors formalize the Liquid Interfaces concept and introduce the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP), which enables intention-based interaction, negotiated execution, and ephemeral relational events under semantic uncertainty.

Result: A reference architecture demonstrates the practical application and feasibility of Liquid Interfaces, showcasing its potential in dynamic coordination.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces establish a foundational approach for adaptive interactions in agent-based systems, offering flexibility and addressing the limitations of static software architectures.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs as teaching assistants by proposing a syllabus-grounded framework that measures teaching effectiveness through student performance improvement after multi-turn instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the insufficient evaluation of large language model teaching capabilities, specifically focusing on knowledge-centered teaching rather than problem-solving.

Method: The authors developed a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that restricts LLMs to structured knowledge points and example problems, minimizing information leakage and allowing benchmark reuse.

Result: Experiments on Gaokao data reveal that teaching effectiveness varies across models and domains, with strong performance in mathematics but challenges in teaching physics and chemistry.

Conclusion: Teaching ability emerges as a distinct and measurable aspect of large language model behavior, and incorporating example problems does not necessarily enhance their teaching.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataCross, a framework and benchmark aimed at unifying analysis across structured data sources and unstructured visual documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of fragmented critical information across structured and unstructured data, which existing analytics solutions fail to integrate.

Method: The researchers developed DataCrossBench for testing multi-modal data analysis and DataCrossAgent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human analyst workflows. The framework uses sub-agents for specific data types and introduces techniques like reReAct for debugging and verification.

Result: DataCrossAgent showed a 29.7% factuality improvement compared to GPT-4o and outperformed on complex tasks, enabling effective cross-modal data integration.

Conclusion: DataCross successfully bridges the gap in multi-modal data analysis by activating unstructured 'zombie data' and providing a robust solution for cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'World of Workflows' (WoW), a ServiceNow-based benchmark to test LLMs within complex enterprise systems. It highlights the deficiencies of LLMs in modeling hidden workflows and cascading effects, proposing grounded world modeling as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in enterprise benchmarking by evaluating LLMs in realistic, complex environments where limited observability and hidden workflows pose real challenges.

Method: They developed WoW, a ServiceNow-based simulation with 4,000+ business rules and 55 workflows, providing a benchmark (WoW-bench) with 234 tasks for testing constrained task completion and enterprise-scaled dynamics.

Result: The study found that LLMs have 'dynamics blindness,' failing to predict cascading side effects of actions. It demonstrates that grounding agents in world modeling is critical for reliable performance in enterprise systems.

Conclusion: For effectiveness in enterprise systems, LLMs must adopt a paradigm of learning system dynamics through comprehensive grounded world modeling. WoW serves as a vital resource for advancing this domain.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMI, a framework combining intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 through dynamic interpolation for efficient and accurate reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interference between cognitive modes (System 1 and System 2) limits the effectiveness of unified language models. Current approaches focus on controlling model outputs, missing the root cause related to cognitive configuration.

Method: The authors leverage existing model checkpoints (Instruct and Thinking) and apply parameter interpolation to modulate cognitive depth and reasoning intensity dynamically through the DAMI framework.

Result: DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, retaining efficiency and enhancing cognitive depth.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently unifies the depth of System 2 reasoning with the concise efficiency of System 1, setting a novel paradigm for capability control in language models.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

### [58] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language models interpret negated instructions and finds that many struggle, often endorsing prohibited actions instead. The authors also propose a metric, NSI, for governance and a framework for improving model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address how AI systems interpret negated instructions, particularly in high-stakes ethical contexts, as misinterpretation could lead to unsafe actions.

Method: The study audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios, analyzed their behavior under negation, and introduced the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric. Deterministic decoding was used to rule out sampling noise.

Result: Open-source models endorsed prohibited actions 77%-100% under negation, while commercial models had swings of 19-128%. Agreement among models dropped when interpreting negated instructions, with financial scenarios proving more error-prone than medical ones.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between current AI alignment methods and the requirements for safe deployment. Models must reliably distinguish affirmative and negated instructions, particularly in high-stakes settings, to ensure safety.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

TL;DR: This paper discovers a "Paradox of Robustness" where instruction-tuned LLMs are highly resistant to narrative manipulation, showing near-total invariance to emotional framing effects despite general lexical sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs in high-stakes, rule-bound decision-making contexts, examining their ability to resist biases and manipulations.

Method: A novel controlled perturbation framework was applied across three domains: healthcare, law, and finance, measuring LLM robustness against emotional and narrative manipulations, and comparing their behavior to humans.

Result: LLMs demonstrated 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human participants, with near-zero emotional framing effect sizes (Cohen's h = 0.003), contrasting with human bias levels (Cohen's h between 0.3 and 0.8).

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs can maintain a high degree of logical rule adherence, remaining robust against persuasive narratives. This makes them potentially valuable for institutional decision-making, complementing or de-biasing human judgment.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LION, a novel approach for multimodal-attributed graphs using Clifford algebra to address alignment and fusion inefficiencies in current methods, demonstrating superior performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph ML representation and utility in multimodal-attributed graphs, addressing limitations in context neglect during modality alignment and inadequate adaptations for modality fusion.

Method: Proposed LION, utilizing Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm to achieve alignment-then-fusion, with high-order graph propagation for alignment and adaptive holographic aggregation for fusion.

Result: Extensive evaluation on 9 datasets shows LION outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three graph and three modality downstream tasks.

Conclusion: LION effectively addresses challenges in multimodal-attributed graphs by enhancing modality interaction and fusion, making it a promising approach for advancing graph ML.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [61] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Topeax, a new text clustering method addressing flaws in Top2Vec and BERTopic, offering improved cluster recovery and keyword quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text clustering methods (Top2Vec, BERTopic) fail to discover natural clusters reliably, struggle with term importance metrics, and produce incoherent topics.

Method: Topeax estimates the number of clusters using density peaks and integrates lexical and semantic term importance indices.

Result: Topeax outperforms Top2Vec and BERTopic in cluster recovery, description quality, and stability across varying samples and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax offers a more reliable and coherent topic modelling alternative to existing clustering approaches.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity offers an effective approach for low-latency, energy-efficient, and adaptive control in dynamic robotic systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a paradigm for sensing in 6G wireless radios using low-complexity RF chains and frequency agility, enabling seamless sensing and communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mmWave sensing solutions rely on complex radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constraints of wireless nodes. The paper aims to propose an alternative sensing approach that seamlessly integrates with wireless radios.

Method: FaA repurposes frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture using single RF chain and frequency-scanning leaky-wave antennas, enabling spatial sensing by reusing communication frequency sweeps.

Result: FaA achieves fine angular and range discrimination with high architectural efficiency, outperforming conventional MIMO sensing under identical physical and spectral conditions.

Conclusion: Near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless communication systems, paving the way for efficient, embeddable ISAC nodes for various applications like smart homes and industrial edge deployments.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSearchQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance on challenging multi-step information-seeking tasks across various fields. It tests agents' ability to search, synthesize, and reason effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in current benchmarks by introducing tasks that test agents on complex search and reasoning abilities, rather than single answer retrieval or general factuality.

Method: The benchmark consists of 900 prompts across 17 fields, with tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, precision in information collation, and entity resolution. Tasks are grounded in real-world, verifiable data from the open web.

Result: Evaluation of advanced agent architectures shows significant struggles with balancing recall and precision, as well as specific errors such as under-retrieval and low-confidence overgeneration.

Conclusion: The paper identifies key weaknesses in existing AI agents and frames DeepSearchQA as a valuable tool for advancing robust agent design and multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper suggests innovative methods for enhancing speech recognition evaluations, especially for complex languages, introduces a new Russian test set, and provides tools for effective comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speech recognition evaluations for non-Latin languages and cluttered or long-form datasets, ensuring better alignment and adaptability.

Method: Proposed a new alignment algorithm, introduced a DiverseSpeech-Ru test set for Russian, performed dataset-specific labeling studies, and developed visual transcription comparison tools.

Result: Better word alignment capabilities, unveiling labeling adaptability in models, introduced tools for streaming transcriptions, and published code resources.

Conclusion: The advancements enable more effective speech recognition evaluations, provide better handling of language complexities, and offer resources for further research development.

Abstract: We propose several improvements to the speech recognition evaluation. First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to develop reasoning benchmarks for Urdu, a low-resource language, by using a contextually ensembled translation framework validated with human input. Analysis of the developed benchmarks highlights challenges and insights into multilingual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized reasoning benchmarks for low-resource languages like Urdu, which face evaluation challenges due to machine translation sensitivity and focus on general tasks over reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes a contextually ensembled translation framework leveraging multiple systems, validated by humans, to create Urdu reasoning benchmarks. Widely used datasets are translated and evaluated with reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs.

Result: Urdu reasoning benchmarks (UrduBench) were developed, and evaluations show challenges in multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks. Analysis highlighted differences across datasets, task difficulties, model architectures, scaling, and language alignment.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a scalable and standardized way to evaluate reasoning in Urdu and other low-resource languages. Empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures are shared, and resources will be publicly accessible.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to strong reasoning capabilities; however, evaluating such models in low-resource languages remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning. Overall, our work establishes a scalable methodology for standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and provides empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures. This experimental setup is also broadly applicable to other low-resource languages. The code and datasets will be publicly released.

### [67] [Position-invariant Fine-tuning of Speech Enhancement Models with Self-supervised Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21084)
*Amit Meghanani,Thomas Hain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving the integration of speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tasks in noisy conditions by addressing limitations in current fine-tuning methods, notably positional dependency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the inefficiency and positional dependency issues in fine-tuning SE models with SSL models, which limit the use of content-related information for speech tasks in noisy conditions.

Method: The authors propose two strategies: (1) zero-padding during fine-tuning to reduce positional dependency, and (2) speed perturbations combined with soft-DTW loss to prioritize content over position.

Result: The soft-DTW-based approach leads to faster convergence and improved performance in downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

Conclusion: Position-invariant fine-tuning, particularly using soft-DTW loss and speed perturbations, enhances the integration of SE and SSL models, improving downstream performance in noisy conditions.

Abstract: Integrating front-end speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models is effective for downstream tasks in noisy conditions. SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

*Ketan Thakkar,Maitreyi Chatterjee,Ramasubramanian Balasubramanian,Achyuthan Jootoo,Rajendra Ugrani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkWise LoRA provides an efficient fine-tuning of large language models by dynamically adapting low-rank configurations to token complexity, improving latency, memory efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods use static rank configurations uniformly across tokens, neglecting token-specific complexities and computational requirements, which limits adaptability and efficiency.

Method: ChunkWise LoRA employs a runtime scheduler to partition sequences into chunks by token complexity, assigning tailored low-rank configurations dynamically. It incorporates a boundary-safe module, KV-cache strategies, and a rank-ladder selection mechanism.

Result: Experiments show ChunkWise LoRA reduces latency by up to 34% and memory usage by 38%, while maintaining or enhancing task metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

Conclusion: ChunkWise LoRA is a practical, adaptive solution for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs that integrates seamlessly with current transformer architectures and inference pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores efficient strategies for creating smaller, multi-task code LLMs by comparing data mixing and model merging approaches, with results favoring model merging for larger models and data mixing for smaller ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of developing smaller code language models (LLMs) that can perform multiple tasks efficiently while balancing performance, constraints, and costs.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments with two code LLM model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), applying data mixing and model merging techniques. They also introduced a weight analysis technique to study task-specific parameter effects.

Result: Model merging demonstrated superior overall performance at larger scales, retaining 96% of specialized model performance in code generation tasks and sometimes surpassing task-specific models. Data mixing emerged as the better strategy for smaller-scale models.

Conclusion: Carefully designed merging and mixing strategies effectively integrate task-specific capabilities while minimizing performance trade-offs, making them suitable for resource-limited deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Recent research advocates deploying smaller, specialized code LLMs in agentic frameworks alongside frontier models, sparking interest in efficient strategies for multi-task learning that balance performance, constraints, and costs. We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional ethnic classification methods like BISG in identifying ethnicity based on names across various contexts and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in ethnic inference methods (like BISG), which have restricted accuracy, geographic applicability, and biases, by leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The paper tested six models (e.g., GPT-4o, open-source models) using datasets from the U.S., India, and other regions to evaluate accuracy; additional metadata and reasoning capabilities were also evaluated for improvement.

Result: LLM-based classification achieved higher accuracy (up to 86.7%) vs. 68.2% for BISG, and it also corrected biases in ethnic misclassification, especially for socioeconomic factors.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a superior, adaptable, and cost-effective approach for ethnic inference compared to traditional methods, with promising scalability for global applications.

Abstract: I demonstrate that large language models can infer ethnicity from names with accuracy exceeding that of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, enabling inference outside the United States and to contextually appropriate classification categories. Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnsembleLink, a new method for record linkage, achieves high accuracy without training labels by leveraging pre-trained language models and operates efficiently without external services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve record linkage accuracy in social science research without requiring substantial labeled training data or introducing unquantified uncertainty in downstream analyses.

Method: EnsembleLink exploits pre-trained language models to recognize semantic relationships between entities, eliminating the need for labeled data.

Result: EnsembleLink demonstrates performance on par with or better than heavily trained methods across various benchmarks and contexts, completing tasks efficiently with open-source resources.

Conclusion: EnsembleLink offers a reliable, fast, and label-free solution for record linkage using pre-trained language models, advancing the methodological rigor in empirical social science.

Abstract: Record linkage, the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across datasets, is essential to empirical social science but remains methodologically underdeveloped. Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels. EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that "South Ozone Park" is a neighborhood in "New York City" or that "Lutte ouvriere" refers to the Trotskyist "Workers' Struggle" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling. The method runs locally on open-source models, requiring no external API calls, and completes typical linkage tasks in minutes.

*Tobias Materzok*

TL;DR: This paper introduces Output-Space Search (OS-Search), a method for transforming LLM generation into an endpoint search using a 3D output space and enabling parallel and optimized outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in traditional token/program search for text and code generation by creating a method for parallel optimization in an output space.

Method: The method involves training a retrieval-grounded policy using sequence-level RL to target specific coordinates in a 3D output space, enabling efficient black-box optimization and sweeps.

Result: The approach shows 3.1x higher diversity for text generation compared to prompt-chaining and improves code objectives while maintaining validity within the same inference budget.

Conclusion: OS-Search provides a novel framework for LLM optimization, significantly improving text and code generation efficiency and diversity while maintaining output validity.

Abstract: We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates conditions under which hierarchical language structure can be learned from linear input, focusing on the statistical properties of function words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how hierarchical language structures can be inferred from linear input aids in advancing natural language learning models and comprehension.

Method: Cross-linguistic corpus analysis of function words across 186 languages; counterfactual language modeling; ablation experiments.

Result: Languages with distinctive statistical properties in their function words are more easily learned by neural models, with frequency and structural association being key contributors.

Conclusion: The statistical distribution of function words supports language acquisition, with different learning conditions influencing the reliance on these words and the mechanisms of acquisition.

Abstract: What statistical conditions support learning hierarchical structure from linear input? In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.

TL;DR: The study examines embedding scaling as an alternative to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for large language model sparsity, proposing a novel model, LongCat-Flash-Lite, that achieves competitive performance with enhanced inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks in sparsity scaling of large language models using MoE architectures.

Method: The paper explores embedding scaling, identifies key architectural factors for its success, integrates system optimizations, and designs LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model.

Result: Embedding scaling demonstrated a better Pareto frontier compared to MoE in specific scenarios, achieving superior inference speedups. LongCat-Flash-Lite surpassed MoE baselines and performed competitively in several domains.

Conclusion: Embedding scaling, when coupled with system-level optimizations, can be an effective alternative to MoE for sparsity scaling, unlocking significant performance benefits in large language models.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

*Eunjung Yeo,Julie M. Liss,Visar Berisha,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multilingual framework for assessing speech intelligibility in dysarthric speakers, with metrics tailored to capture language-specific factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing neurological disorders linked with dysarthria highlight the need for language-independent intelligibility assessment methods.

Method: The authors developed a framework combining universal phone recognition, language-specific phoneme interpretation, and phonological feature mapping and alignment.

Result: The framework introduces three metrics (PER, PFER, PhonCov) and demonstrates their effectiveness across multiple languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework accurately captures intelligibility degradation patterns in dysarthric speech, offering potential clinical utility.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria motivates the need for automated intelligibility assessment methods that are applicalbe across languages. However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jiatong Li,Gangwei Jiang,Linqi Song,Defu Lian,Ying Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates reasoning hop generalization difficulties in LLMs and proposes a method to improve performance through test-time correction of erroneous processing heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observed failure of LLMs to generalize when reasoning steps exceed the training distribution, despite unchanged algorithms.

Method: The authors identify token-level errors caused by certain attention heads (ep heads) that amplify incorrect reasoning. They propose a lightweight intervention method to detect and deactivate these heads during inference.

Result: The proposed method effectively improves reasoning performance across various tasks and LLMs in reasoning hop generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Test-time correction of ep heads is a promising technique to enhance LLM reasoning abilities, revealing insights into failure mechanisms and providing practical improvements.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has become the standard paradigm for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.

*Christopher Adrian Kusuma,Muhammad Reza Qorib,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on addressing LLMs’ knowledge boundary issues and proposes a robust evaluation dataset and a novel method for improving honesty using pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate inaccurate responses as they fail to recognize their knowledge boundaries, which leads to hallucination. The paper aims to create more honest LLMs and robust evaluations for assessing honesty.

Method: The researchers designed an evaluation benchmark dataset leveraging the open-source LLM, Pythia, with its publicly available pretraining data. They also introduced a new approach to utilize pretraining data to improve LLM honesty.

Result: A benchmark dataset for evaluating honesty in LLMs was developed, and a novel method to enhance honesty using pretraining data was introduced.

Conclusion: By utilizing Pythia’s publicly available pretraining data, the paper provides a robust evaluation dataset for LLM honesty and advances the methodology for creating more truthful LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable of answering questions, but they are often unaware of their own knowledge boundary, i.e., knowing what they know and what they don't know. As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fed-MedLoRA, a federated learning framework designed to adapt large language models (LLMs) for medical applications while addressing issues of communication overhead and data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable collaborative model development across healthcare institutions while overcoming the challenges of using LLMs in clinical settings, particularly issues related to generalizability, communication/computation inefficiencies, and cross-site data heterogeneity.

Method: The authors developed Fed-MedLoRA, a model-agnostic federated learning framework that transmits only low-rank adapter parameters to reduce overhead. Furthermore, Fed-MedLoRA+ incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to handle cross-site heterogeneity effectively.

Result: The framework was applied to clinical information extraction tasks, achieving high accuracy across five patient cohorts. The model outperformed baseline models under various evaluation settings such as in-domain testing, external validation, and low-resource new-site adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ frameworks provide an efficient, scalable, and generalizable solution for adapting LLMs to complex medical applications while addressing the challenges of model communication and data heterogeneity in federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MGSM-Pro, an extended multilingual math reasoning dataset, emphasizing robustness issues and proposing five problem instantiations to ensure diverse evaluations across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for multilingual mathematical reasoning are insufficiently developed compared to English, particularly in their ability to handle variability and robustness across different question representations.

Method: The authors extended the MGSM dataset using the GSM-Symbolic method, creating five instantiations for each question by altering names, digits, and irrelevant context. They tested these modifications on nine languages and multiple models, analyzing robustness to instantiations.

Result: Evaluations showed significant performance drops in low-resource languages with digit variations. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1 performed inconsistently on these variations, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet and open models like GPT-OSS 120B displayed more robustness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for diverse instantiations in math reasoning benchmarks to improve robustness and realism, recommending at least five instantiations for a fairer evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models have made substantial progress in mathematical reasoning. However, benchmark development for multilingual evaluation has lagged behind English in both difficulty and recency. Recently, GSM-Symbolic showed a strong evidence of high variance when models are evaluated on different instantiations of the same question; however, the evaluation was conducted only in English. In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 show stronger robustness. Based on these findings, we recommend evaluating each problem using at least five digit-varying instantiations to obtain a more robust and realistic assessment of math reasoning.

### [80] [SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21235)
*Alok Abhishek,Tushar Bandopadhyay,Lisa Erickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new evaluation framework, SHARP, for large language models to address the limitations of scalar evaluation by providing multidimensional, distribution-aware risk profiles of social harm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the evaluation of social harms caused by large language models (LLMs), particularly by addressing failures and risks ignored by simplistic, mean-centered evaluation techniques.

Method: The SHARP framework models harm as a multivariate random variable with explicit decomposition into core dimensions like bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability. It employs additive cumulative log-risk and risk-sensitive metrics like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) to capture worst-case and tail behavior for socially sensitive LLM prompts.

Result: Applying the SHARP framework to eleven large language models using 901 socially sensitive prompts demonstrated significant differences in their risk profiles. Models with similar average risks revealed diverse tail exposures and failure structures. Bias-related risks exhibited the strongest severities, followed by fairness and epistemic risks, with ethical misalignments being consistently lower.

Conclusion: Scalar averaging metrics miss critical tail risks and cross-dimensional harm structures. The findings advocate for using multidimensional, distribution-aware approaches like SHARP for responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for consolidated research and tools in model collaboration as existing work is scattered and lacks standardization.

Method: MoCo consists of 26 collaboration methods, integrating 25 datasets for evaluation, allowing for large-scale benchmarking of how multiple language models collaborate and solve tasks.

Result: Experiments reveal that collaboration outperforms standalone models 61% of the time, with some strategies offering significant performance gains up to 25.8%.

Conclusion: MoCo offers a valuable resource for advancing collaborative AI, showing its utility in solving challenging tasks and laying the groundwork for further research in the field.

Abstract: Advancing beyond single monolithic language models (LMs), recent research increasingly recognizes the importance of model collaboration, where multiple LMs collaborate, compose, and complement each other. Existing research on this topic has mostly been disparate and disconnected, from different research communities, and lacks rigorous comparison. To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalEmbed, an auto-regressive approach for generating efficient embeddings for Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models face scalability issues in Visual Document Retrieval due to storage limitations caused by representing pages with thousands of visual tokens.

Method: CausalEmbed leverages iterative margin loss during contrastive training and employs auto-regressive generation to construct compact multi-vector embeddings for efficient document retrieval.

Result: CausalEmbed achieves a 30-155x reduction in token count for visual tokens, maintaining high performance across benchmarks and backbones, with improved training efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: CausalEmbed provides a scalable solution for real-world VDR, introducing a generative paradigm and flexible test-time strategies for multi-vector document embeddings.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) through generating high-quality multi-vector embeddings, the substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time. As a result, CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for robust ASR models supporting 52 languages and dialects, along with improving forced alignment efficiency.

Method: Development of Qwen3-ASR-1.7B/0.6B based on large-scale training data leveraging Qwen3-Omni foundation model; also includes Qwen3-ForcedAligner for timestamping.

Result: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves SOTA open-sourced performance; Qwen3-ASR-0.6B balances accuracy-efficiency; Qwen3-ForcedAligner excels in alignment accuracy and versatility.

Conclusion: Qwen3-ASR models advance ASR capabilities and support community research by being open-sourced under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pretraining method using reinforcement learning to enhance safety, factuality, and quality in large language model outputs, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical challenge of improving safety, factuality, and quality in large language model outputs, which are often compromised during pretraining and deployed unsafely in real applications.

Method: A new pretraining approach streaming documents is developed, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize the model's next K token generations. It utilizes quality checks by a strong post-trained model and gradually improves model outputs based on RL rewards.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms standard pretraining, showing 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements in factuality and safety respectively, and achieves up to 86.3% improvement in generation quality.

Conclusion: By addressing quality, safety, and factuality issues during pretraining with a novel RL-based method, this work demonstrates the possibility of creating inherently safer and higher-quality language models, reducing reliance on post-training corrections.

Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the flaws in using large language models (LLMs) for educational code assessment, introducing two frameworks to reveal vulnerabilities and demonstrate adversarial exploits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the assumption that LLMs' instruction-following capabilities are reliable for objective code assessment, highlighting the systemic vulnerability termed the Compliance Paradox.

Method: The study introduces SPACI and AST-ASIP frameworks to expose systemic issues by injecting adversarial directives into inert regions of Abstract Syntax Trees and evaluates this on 9 models, 25,000 submissions, and across four programming languages.

Result: Over 95% failure rates were observed in high-capacity open-weight models, revealing their tendency to prioritize directives over logical correctness. A tripartite framework quantifies these issues.

Conclusion: The research signifies that current models optimized for compliance have significant vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need to shift towards Adjudicative Robustness for better reliability in automated assessments.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Evidence Ranking, a novel approach to improve the efficiency and reliability of fact verification in NLP by prioritizing sufficient information in ranked lists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in NLP regarding retrieval of concise evidence for assessing information reliability, aiming to overcome issues of insufficient or redundant data presented by automated systems and LLMs.

Method: Proposes Evidence Ranking task with one-shot and incremental ranking models, using a new evaluation framework inspired by information retrieval metrics and a unified benchmark combining fact verification datasets.

Result: Incremental ranking strategies capture complementary evidence better, LLM-based methods outperform baselines, but balancing sufficiency and redundancy remains challenging. Evidence Ranking reduces user reading and improves verification.

Conclusion: Evidence Ranking enhances interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification, providing a foundational advancement in natural language processing systems.

Abstract: Attribution and fact verification are critical challenges in natural language processing for assessing information reliability. While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification. This work provides a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

*Yuan Sui,Bryan Hooi*

TL;DR: The paper presents CoNL, a framework for training language models on non-verifiable tasks by unifying generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of training LLMs for non-verifiable tasks where ground-truth labels are unavailable and to overcome limitations of current judge-based approaches affected by evaluator biases and quality constraints.

Method: The CoNL framework employs multi-agent self-play, where agents propose, critique, and improve solutions collaboratively, with a diagnostic reward system for critiques that lead to improvements. This allows joint optimization of generation and evaluation without external evaluators.

Result: CoNL demonstrated consistent improvements across five benchmarks compared to self-rewarding baselines, showing stable training and enhanced performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation, enabling improved training of LLMs for challenging non-verifiable tasks without reliance on external judges or ground-truth data.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOUP, a token-level framework integrating off- and on-policy reinforcement learning for stable and improved language model post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address exploration limitations and early saturation in language model post-training, which arises due to low sampling diversity in on-policy RL methods.

Method: SOUP unifies off- and on-policy learning at the token level within individual samples, confining off-policy data to the sequence prefix, while continuing on-policy; it uses token-level importance ratios for stability.

Result: SOUP outperforms traditional on-policy training and current off-policy extensions across multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: SOUP enhances exploration and final performance in large language model reinforcement learning by adopting a fine-grained mix-policy approach.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods widely used for language model post-training, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity. While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\textbf{O}$licy $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

TL;DR: The paper presents DimStance, a multilingual resource that models stance along valence and arousal dimensions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis across diverse languages and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance stance detection by moving beyond categorical labels to a dimensional framework that incorporates affective nuances like valence and arousal.

Method: The paper introduces DimStance, a novel resource containing valence-arousal annotations across multiple languages and domains. It formulates a dimensional stance regression task and benchmarks various language models.

Result: Evaluation reveals that fine-tuned LLMs perform well for stance regression, but challenges persist for low-resource languages and token-based generation.

Conclusion: DimStance marks a significant step towards emotion-aware and multilingual stance detection, though there remains room for improving low-resource language support.

Abstract: Stance detection is an established task that classifies an author's attitude toward a specific target into categories such as Favor, Neutral, and Against. Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation. DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware, stance analysis and benchmarking.

*Meet Doshi,Aashka Trivedi,Vishwajeet Kumar,Parul Awasthy,Yulong Li,Jaydeep Sen,Radu Florian,Sachindra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMK pooling to overcome weaknesses in current representation pooling techniques, improving performance on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pooling strategies like [CLS] and mean pooling show weaknesses in information representation for tasks requiring variable-length sequence processing, particularly in short and long contexts.

Method: The proposed LMK pooling partitions sequences into chunks, introduces landmark tokens between them, and applies mean-pooling to these landmarks to form the final representation.

Result: LMK pooling performs comparably to other techniques for short-context tasks while significantly improving results in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: LMK pooling is a scalable and effective alternative to existing pooling methods, improving representation learning for long-context tasks without sacrificing short-context performance.

Abstract: Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces inversedMixup, a method combining Mixup's controllability and LLM-based readability for data augmentation in NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance augmentations that are both readable and offer sufficient control over the generation process in NLP.

Method: It proposes inversedMixup, leveraging LLM inversion for embedding alignment to generate controllable yet interpretable augmented samples.

Result: Results showcase superior augmentation performance across few-shot and fully supervised settings, along with mitigation of manifold intrusion.

Conclusion: InversedMixup enhances augmentation by aligning task model embeddings with LLMs, ensuring both interpretability and control, and demonstrates improved effectiveness in various experiments.

Abstract: Mixup generates augmented samples by linearly interpolating inputs and labels with a controllable ratio. However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework, 'Note2Chat,' to enhance clinical history-taking and diagnostic reasoning using medical notes instead of dialogue data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic tasks that require adaptive questioning and reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a framework named 'Note2Chat' that generates doctor-patient dialogues from medical notes via a decision tree-guided process and fine-tunes LLMs through supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning.

Result: The framework achieves significant performance improvements in clinical reasoning tasks, with +16.9 F1 score and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using medical notes and a novel single-turn reasoning approach can improve LLM-based diagnostic accuracy, with the potential to advance clinical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Effective clinical history taking is a foundational yet underexplored component of clinical reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

TL;DR: ASTRA is a framework designed to enhance tool-augmented large language model agents using automated data synthesis and verified reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to train robust tool-using agents that can handle long-horizon, multi-turn tasks effectively with automated and verifiable processes.

Method: ASTRA combines diverse trajectory synthesis using tool-call graphs and an environment synthesis framework based on human semantic reasoning, coupled with a unified training methodology using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to ensure stable and efficient learning.

Result: ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance on tool-use benchmarks, effectively balancing task completion and reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: ASTRA addresses key challenges in training robust tool-using agents by integrating scalable framework design and unified training methods, making significant advancements in this space while sharing resources publicly for further use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KromHC to improve upon mHC by addressing training instability and parameter complexity, offering better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the instability and scalability limitations in Hyper-Connections (HC) due to inefficiencies in mHC and mHC-lite.

Method: KromHC leverages Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices for parameterizing the residual matrix, reducing the complexity and ensuring exact double stochasticity through manifold constraints.

Result: KromHC achieves performance parity or better compared to other mHC variants while significantly reducing parameter requirements.

Conclusion: KromHC offers a scalable and stable alternative for residual matrix parameterization in HC, demonstrating reduced complexity and improved efficiency in experiments.

Abstract: The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\mathcal{O} \left( nC \cdot n! \right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: The paper simulates crosslinguistic influence (CLI) in language models to understand its driving factors like language dominance and second language proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting results in bilingualism research by using controlled simulations in language models to study CLI.

Method: Simulated CLI in language models by manipulating factors such as L1 dominance and L2 proficiency and analyzing syntactic impacts through cross-linguistic priming.

Result: Confirmed dominance and proficiency influence CLI; found bidirectional priming of grammatical structures, with ungrammatical priming sensitive to dominance; demonstrated L1's direct influence during L2 processing.

Conclusion: Language models can act as computational tools to inform theories of human CLI and simulate its mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of effective inference-time control mechanisms in Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) for text generation.

Method: ILRR dynamically aligns the internal activations of the generated sequence with a reference sequence during the denoising process, while Spatially Modulated Steering adjusts guidance for long texts using shorter references.

Result: ILRR achieves significant improvements in attribute steering accuracy (10%-60% higher) over baselines for LLaDA and MDLM architectures with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ILRR provides a learning-free, efficient, and effective method for attribute steering in DLMs, enhancing text generation control while preserving quality.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy to adapt tokenizers of large language models for specific domains or languages by replacing low-utility tokens with more relevant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies caused by generic tokenizers in encoding domain-specific or language-specific data.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm that adapts tokenizers post-training by identifying and replacing tokens with low utility based on their frequency in a target adaptation corpus.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adapted tokenizers outperform baselines in compressing test corpora for generation and classification tasks across various languages while using the same vocabulary size.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows for lightweight, domain-specific optimization of subword tokenization, akin to fine-tuning, improving efficiency and performance without altering the model training process.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), significantly impact the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to measure semantic progression in text as stochastic trajectories, using Allan deviation for analysis. It identifies distinct dynamics and compares human text to AI text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the elusive dynamics behind semantic progression in language and measure the coherence of meaning in text.

Method: The authors applied Allan deviation to ordered sentence embeddings, treating them as displacement signals. They analyzed the dynamics associated with semantic coherence and compared human-written text to AI-generated text.

Result: Two dynamical regimes were identified: short-time scaling differentiates creative and technical writing, while long-time analysis showed a stability-limited noise floor. Large language models mimic local human text dynamics but have reduced stability horizons.

Conclusion: Semantic coherence is measurable and reveals differences between human cognition and AI text generation dynamics, providing a physical framework for analyzing meaning progression.

Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns over privacy, copyright, and harmful materials in LLMs, and the inefficiency of existing unlearning methods in handling large, continuous deletion requests without degrading model utility.

Method: The proposed \fit framework mitigates challenges via filtering, importance-aware updates, and targeted layer attribution techniques. It enables stable unlearning across long sequences and balances forgetting effectiveness with utility retention.

Result: \fit outperforms current methods in balancing forgetting and utility preservation, demonstrated through improved scores on evaluations such as MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K, and exhibits resistance against relearning and recovery attacks.

Conclusion: \fit offers a robust solution to continual unlearning in LLMs and introduces useful benchmarks and metrics, paving the way for improved privacy and content moderation without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks but raise concerns about privacy, copyright, and harmful materials. Existing LLM unlearning methods rarely consider the continual and high-volume nature of real-world deletion requests, which can cause utility degradation and catastrophic forgetting as requests accumulate. To address this challenge, we introduce \fit, a framework for continual unlearning that handles large numbers of deletion requests while maintaining robustness against both catastrophic forgetting and post-unlearning recovery. \fit mitigates degradation through rigorous data \underline{F}iltering, \underline{I}mportance-aware updates, and \underline{T}argeted layer attribution, enabling stable performance across long sequences of unlearning operations and achieving a favorable balance between forgetting effectiveness and utility retention. To support realistic evaluation, we present \textbf{PCH}, a benchmark covering \textbf{P}ersonal information, \textbf{C}opyright, and \textbf{H}armful content in sequential deletion scenarios, along with two symmetric metrics, Forget Degree (F.D.) and Retain Utility (R.U.), which jointly assess forgetting quality and utility preservation. Extensive experiments on four open-source LLMs with hundreds of deletion requests show that \fit achieves the strongest trade-off between F.D. and R.U., surpasses existing methods on MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K, and remains resistant against both relearning and quantization recovery attacks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Recycling Search Experience (RSE),' a new strategy for reasoning tasks using Large Language Models, enabling efficient reuse of insights during test-time search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods waste computational resources by discarding intermediate insights, resulting in redundant inference efforts.

Method: Proposing RSE, a training-free strategy, which accumulates and recycles search experiences to reuse positive conclusions and avoid already-tested failures during inference.

Result: RSE outperforms existing baselines in scaling efficiency, as demonstrated through experiments on benchmarks like HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE.

Conclusion: RSE introduces a more efficient mechanism for leveraging compute resources during reasoning tasks, turning isolated search trials into an iterative knowledge-accumulating process.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

TL;DR: This study proposes DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework designed to enable small language models to achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of small language model agents in low-cost, low-accuracy regimes, where limited resources result in sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training.

Method: The authors introduce DAVID-GRPO, which stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, uses evidence recall for credit assignment, and enhances exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories.

Result: DAVID-GRPO, trained with small-scale setups, demonstrated superior performance compared to prior RL methods on six multi-hop QA benchmarks, despite using agents of up to only 1.5B parameters and four RTX 3090 GPUs.

Conclusion: Small language models can achieve accurate and efficient multi-hop reasoning when guided by proper inductive biases and budget-efficient frameworks.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.

Method: The proposed OG-MAR framework involves creating a global cultural ontology informed by the World Values Survey, implementing value-persona agents, and utilizing a judgment agent to synthesize outputs.

Result: OG-MAR enhances cultural alignment, robustness, and reasoning transparency over baseline methods across multiple LLM models.

Conclusion: OG-MAR offers a structured, ontology-driven approach for improving LLM performance on culturally sensitive decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

### [104] [Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709)
*Qingyue Yang,Jie Wang,Xing Li,Yinqi Bai,Xialiang Tong,Huiling Zhen,Jianye Hao,Mingxuan Yuan,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAPPA, a framework explaining attention patterns in large language models by analyzing mathematical formulations with a temporal perspective. It effectively categorizes attention into predictable and unpredictable types, validating its utility in tasks like cache compression and model pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to unify the fragmented understanding of attention patterns in LLMs and apply this understanding to improve inference efficiency.

Method: The authors propose TAPPA, which mathematically analyzes temporal attention patterns. It categorizes patterns based on query self-similarity and provides detailed analysis using key components like Rotary Positional Embeddings.

Result: The framework distinguishes between predictable and random attention patterns, applying these insights to optimize KV cache compression and pruning tasks, achieving improved performance.

Conclusion: TAPPA provides a mathematical unification of attention behaviors in LLMs, leading to enhanced understanding and efficiency in practical applications. The framework shows broad utility in model optimization tasks.

Abstract: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

*Huiyuan Lai,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TACLer, a reinforcement learning framework, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to reduce computational costs and eliminate redundant reasoning steps while maintaining or improving the reasoning performance of LLMs.

Method: TACLer incorporates tailored curriculum learning and a hybrid reasoning paradigm to progressively train the model and optimize between thoroughness and efficiency.

Result: TACLer achieves a 50% reduction in training computational costs, a 42% reduction in inference token usage, and a 9% accuracy improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: TACLer effectively enhances the performance and efficiency of LLMs, outperforming existing frameworks across complex reasoning datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

*Neil Heinrich Braun,Keane Ong,Rui Mao,Erik Cambria,Gianmarco Mengaldo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework enhancing NLP model robustness against greenwashing and vague claims in sustainability reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of reliable NLP tools for evaluating ESG by analyzing sustainability reports, which often contain ambiguous and misleading claims.

Method: The framework uses contrastive learning, ordinal ranking objective, gated feature modulation, and MetaGradNorm to structure latent spaces and filter noise.

Result: Experiments show the proposed framework has superior robustness and highlight a trade-off between rigidity and generalization.

Conclusion: This approach improves ESG assessment by structuring latent spaces and filtering unreliable information, while addressing limitations of existing NLP models.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims. Our approach incorporates gated feature modulation to filter disclosure noise and utilizes MetaGradNorm to stabilize multi-objective optimization. Experiments in cross-category settings demonstrate superior robustness over standard baselines while revealing a trade-off between representational rigidity and generalization.

*Liangze Jiang,Zachary Shinnick,Anton van den Hengel,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores procedural pretraining on structured data to improve and accelerate language model capabilities, contrasting it with conventional pretraining on natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mimic human cognitive progression, where exposure to structured and abstract reasoning (like logic and mathematics) precedes complex reasoning. This aims to enrich models' semantic understanding and algorithmic skills through structured procedural data.

Method: The authors experiment with pretraining models on procedural data, such as Dyck sequences and formal algorithms, and compare performance gains against standard natural language and mathematical datasets. They also explore gains in larger models and analyze how procedural data impacts attention and MLP layers.

Result: With as little as 0.1% procedural data, models outperform standard pretraining methods on natural language and mathematics datasets, achieving the same loss values with significantly less data. Gains in context recall and structured attention mechanisms are highlighted.

Conclusion: Procedural pretraining is shown to enhance model performance, reduce pretraining data requirements, and improve structural understanding, representing a promising path for disentangling reasoning from knowledge acquisition in language models.

Abstract: Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

### [108] [When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22025)
*Daniel Commey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an evaluation-driven workflow and introduces a Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES) for better testing of large language model applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in evaluating stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive outputs of large language models that cannot be efficiently tested using traditional methods.

Method: The authors propose an evaluation-driven workflow called Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix and introduce MVES, along with specific evaluation methods for general LLMs, RAG, and agentic tool-use workflows.

Result: Experiments show that generic prompt templates can trade off certain behaviors (e.g., reducing RAG compliance) while improving others (e.g., instruction-following). This emphasizes evaluation-driven iteration over universal solutions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that careful evaluation methods are necessary for improving LLM applications, advocating for reproducible processes and iterative designs tailored to specific use cases.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CE-GOCD, a method to enhance scientific question answering by modeling semantic substructures in knowledge graphs, showing improved results over existing methods on NLP datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLMs' comprehension of scientific papers to generate more comprehensive and specific answers by addressing the lack of semantic connections between papers in traditional approaches.

Method: Proposes CE-GOCD, leveraging central entities like paper titles for subgraph retrieval, semantic discovery through graph pruning/completion, and community detection for coherent grouping of papers.

Result: CE-GOCD outperformed traditional retrieval methods for scientific question answering on three NLP datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling semantic substructures within knowledge graphs improves LLM performance in scientific question answering, enhancing response relevance and specificity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for question answering over scientific research papers. Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: This paper presents TeGu, a contrastive decoding method for LLMs that improves performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of contrastive decoding methods in large language models while ensuring stable performance even on small-scale models.

Method: Introduction of Temporal Guidance (TeGu), a contrastive strategy based on temporal dimensions using Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) and a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP) for stabilization.

Result: TeGu demonstrates significant performance improvements across different model series and benchmarks, with low memory and computational overhead.

Conclusion: TeGu provides an effective and efficient contrastive decoding strategy that enhances LLMs while solving the stability and computational cost issues of existing methods.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm to identify content generated by language models like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Extensive testing shows significant performance improvements over previous detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of identifying content generated by large language models (LLMs) to combat misinformation and ensure academic integrity.

Method: The paper builds on a geometric approach to understanding rewrite-based detection and introduces a new algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between original and rewritten texts. Theoretical and experimental evaluations were performed.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms baseline detection methods, achieving relative performance improvements ranging from 57.8% to 80.6% across scenarios and targets.

Conclusion: Adaptive distance functions enhance the effectiveness of rewrite-based detection algorithms. The proposed method shows strong potential in detecting LLM-generated content.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create generative model architectures that surpass Transformers in efficiency (fewer parameters, shorter pre-training time) while retaining or improving their effectiveness on various tasks.

Method: The authors design architectural components inspired by continued fractions, replacing key parts of Transformer blocks while developing custom gradients for optimized training.

Result: CoFrGeNet models showed competitive and occasionally superior performance compared to Transformer models on various tasks, with fewer parameters and shorter pre-training times.

Conclusion: CoFrGeNet architectures are an efficient and effective alternative to traditional Transformers, with potential for improvement when customized to hardware.

Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.

TL;DR: Zonkey introduces a trainable hierarchical model with a differentiable tokenizer to overcome limitations of fixed tokenizers in LLMs, enabling improved adaptability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like BPE hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability in LLMs for handling noisy or specific domain data.

Method: Zonkey uses a hierarchical diffusion model featuring a differentiable tokenizer with probabilistic attention for adaptive splits, variable-length outputs, and reconstruction using a Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM).

Result: Zonkey trained on Wikipedia successfully generates coherent, hierarchically-aligned, and variable-length text, outperforming entropy-based tokenizers in data distribution alignment.

Conclusion: Zonkey's novel approach pushes LLMs toward gradient-based adaptability and scalability, enabling better domain adaptation and effective tokenization. Source code is provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

*Yaocong Li,Leihan Zhang,Le Zhang,Qiang Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KID, a framework that integrates external knowledge into meme analysis to address the challenge of detecting harmful memes with implicit toxicity, achieving improved results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the detection of harmful memes by addressing their reliance on subtle sociocultural and metaphorical content, which poses challenges for automated moderation systems reliant solely on intra-modal and inter-modal signals.

Method: The KID framework uses knowledge-grounded analysis through a dual-head architecture. It applies label-constrained distillation to create reasoning chains linking visual evidence, external knowledge, and classification labels, and optimizes linguistic reasoning and classification objectives simultaneously.

Result: KID achieves state-of-the-art performance on harmful meme detection tasks in five multilingual datasets (English, Chinese, Bengali), delivering improvements ranging from 2.1% to 19.7% in evaluation metrics over previous methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating external knowledge and a dual-head learning approach leads to significant advancements in detecting implicit toxicity in memes, offering a more robust and generalizable framework for harmful content moderation.

Abstract: Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MA-LipNet, a lipreading network utilizing multiple attention modules to enhance feature discriminability and improve lipreading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lipreading systems face challenges with subtle articulatory gestures, leading to limited feature discriminability and generalization. Enhanced feature purification is needed for better lipreading performance.

Method: MA-LipNet uses three attention modules: Channel Attention for refining channel-wise features, Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention for coarse filtering, and Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention for fine-grained spatio-temporal refinement.

Result: Experiments on CMLR and GRID datasets show MA-LipNet reduces Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MA-LipNet effectively highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement in visual speech recognition, showing robust and superior performance in lipreading tasks.

Abstract: Lipreading, the technology of decoding spoken content from silent videos of lip movements, holds significant application value in fields such as public security. However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes improvements for conversational image generation in non-Markov settings to enhance multi-round interaction, consistency, and instruction compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing models in handling referential and long-history-dependent interactions in multi-round conversational image generation.

Method: Introduces data construction strategies that force retrieval of earlier visual states, implements history-conditioned training with token-level caching, and proposes improvements like a reconstruction-based detokenizer and multi-stage fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed approach shows significant improvements in multi-round consistency and compliance with user instructions, while performing strongly in single-round scenarios.

Conclusion: Training explicitly for non-Markov settings enhances conversational image generation systems, making them better at managing multi-turn references and maintaining consistency over time.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a synthetic data-based unrolled dual-domain method to correct low-performance pixel (LPP) artifacts in CT detectors without requiring clinical datasets, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to correct LPP artifacts in CT images arises from these artifacts making images clinically unusable. Existing methods require expensive training datasets and only focus on one domain, either sinogram or image.

Method: A synthetic data-based unrolled dual-domain method was introduced to correct LPP artifacts. The model leverages intrinsic correlations between image and sinogram domains derived from natural images, eliminating the need for clinical data for training.

Result: The proposed method showed significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches in experiments with simulated detector defects near the isocenter (1-2%).

Conclusion: The solution successfully corrects LPP artifacts cost-efficiently without clinical datasets, is adaptable to different scanners, and offers a viable software-based artifact correction solution.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops and assesses an AI-based model trained on prostate biopsy slides to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostatectomy, showing its potential to improve risk prediction, but calls for further critical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for predicting BCR after radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients are inadequate, necessitating more precise and personalized predictive approaches.

Method: The study uses an AI-based model combining foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning, trained on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n=676). Generalizability was tested across three external cohorts with different specimen types.

Result: The model achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64-0.70 across external cohorts and showed improved prognostication when clinical variables were integrated. It outperformed the guideline-based CAPRA-S for postoperative predictions.

Conclusion: AI-based histopathology models trained on biopsy data can generalize across specimen types to aid in pre- and post-operative decisions, but further studies should critically assess their added value over simpler models.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadDet+ introduces a unified framework for backdoor attacks on object detection, addressing weaknesses in existing approaches with superior robustness and clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection-based backdoor attack methods face limitations like reliance on unrealistic assumptions and insufficient validation in physical settings.

Method: BadDet+ employs a log-barrier penalty mechanism for enhancing position and scale invariance, boosting physical robustness, and unifying Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA).

Result: BadDet+ outperforms current baselines in synthetic-to-physical transfers while maintaining clean inference performance.

Conclusion: Object detection is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and specialized defense mechanisms are necessary to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [122] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ActionVLM, a framework addressing modality bias in Temporal Action Localization (TAL) by prioritizing vision over language using adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in TAL overemphasize linguistic priors from vision-language models, causing limited visual performance and modality bias.

Method: The paper proposes a debiasing reweighting module to estimate the incremental benefit from language and dynamically reweight it, alongside a residual aggregation strategy for vision-language combination.

Result: ActionVLM achieves up to 3.2% improved mAP over state-of-the-art methods on the THUMOS14 dataset.

Conclusion: ActionVLM mitigates modality bias by prioritizing vision, adaptively leveraging language, and improving temporal action localization effectiveness.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

TL;DR: The paper presents Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a novel visual framework for improving compositional structural constraints in text-to-image generation, along with a new dataset and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image generation struggles with compositional accuracy, like numeracy, attribute binding, and part relations. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: A visual chain-of-thought (CoT) framework called SoT trains autoregressive models to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered shapes, using a dataset derived from CAD hierarchies.

Result: Fine-tuning on the newly created SoT-26K dataset yields significantly improved results in component numeracy (88.4%) and structural topology (84.8%), outperforming baselines by ~20%.

Conclusion: The study introduces SoT, demonstrating its advantage in producing more reliable and compositional text-to-image outputs, establishing a new paradigm in its domain.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI framework for automated assessment of microsurgical instrument handling skills, addressing the flaws of subjective evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of subjective and inconsistent evaluations of microsurgical performance, providing a scalable, reliable alternative.

Method: Developed an AI framework with core modules: YOLO-based instrument detection, DeepSORT-based tracking, shape descriptor-driven tip localization, and supervised classification.

Result: Experimental results show 97% instrument detection precision and 96% mAP, evaluated with IoU thresholds between 50%-95%.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework demonstrates promising capability in providing automated, accurate, and scalable microsurgical skill assessment.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDCI, a training-free framework enhancing remote sensing semantic segmentation by addressing feature fusion and boundary prediction challenges, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing imagery features dense and complex structures demanding improved geometric and semantic modeling, unmet by current methods for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Method: SDCI utilizes a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) for feature encoding, a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) for segmentation reliability, and superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) for refining boundaries.

Result: SDCI showed superior results on various benchmarks and confirmed the effectiveness of traditional superpixel structures in modern deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The SDCI framework offers improved geometric localization and semantic prediction for remote sensing imagery while maintaining effectiveness of legacy methods, contributing significantly to OVSS advancements.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes.

*Chenyu Huang,Peng Ye,Xudong Tan,Jinhan Mu,Shenghe Zheng,Li Shen,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRISM, a fine-grained reasoning injection framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance reasoning without compromising visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for merging VLMs with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) struggle to balance reasoning enhancement with visual capability preservation, due to coarse-grained approaches.

Method: FRISM utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose reasoning vectors and adaptively tunes subspace coefficients for fine-grained reasoning injection. It also employs a label-free self-distillation learning strategy using common datasets.

Result: FRISM demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities while preserving visual capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fine-grained subspace-level merging effectively enhances reasoning in VLMs without visual capability compromise, paving the way for better integration of reasoning models.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) challenges using a two-stage method called GRDR, which uses a generative retrieval model with improved semantic tokenization and retrieval capabilities, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores TVR for large-scale video platforms, aiming to address inefficiencies in dense retrieval systems and improve recall speed and storage scalability.

Method: The authors introduce GRDR, a generative recall method assigning diverse semantic IDs to videos through a multi-view tokenizer with joint training of tokenizer and retriever, leveraging trie-constrained decoding for efficient recall.

Result: GRDR achieves accuracy comparable to dense retrievers, reduces storage requirements significantly, and accelerates retrieval processes by up to 300× on benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRDR improves TVR efficiency and storage viability, presenting a scalable solution for real-time large-scale video retrieval applications.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with robot-specific perception tasks, such as perspective recognition and understanding video endings.

Method: The authors provide a large-scale dataset for robotic perception and reasoning and introduce a method to improve video comprehension by combining key frames and full video inputs.

Result: Thinker establishes state-of-the-art performance in task planning benchmarks, validating its approach.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and video comprehension method significantly advance embodied intelligence in robotics.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the unexplored vulnerabilities in multi-image MLLMs, particularly under black-box threat models, as previous attacks predominately focus on single-image settings and white-box approaches.

Method: LAMP introduces an attention-based constraint to disrupt information aggregation across images, a cross-image contagious constraint to spread adversarial effects to clean inputs without modifying all, and an index-attention suppression loss to enhance position-invariant attacks.

Result: LAMP demonstrates superior attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple vision-language models and tasks.

Conclusion: LAMP is an effective black-box adversarial attack framework for multi-image MLLMs, revealing previously unaddressed vulnerabilities and offering new benchmarks for evaluating model robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on quantizing AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models, presenting a new framework, PTQ4ARVG, to tackle key challenges, enabling efficient 8-bit and 6-bit quantization with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is a valuable technique to reduce model size and computational cost, yet existing methods fail to adapt well to ARVG models. The authors aim to address the challenges specific to ARVG quantization.

Method: The PTQ4ARVG framework is introduced, which includes Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) to handle channel-wise outliers, Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) to resolve token-wise variance, and Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) to address sample-wise distribution mismatch.

Result: The PTQ4ARVG framework successfully quantizes ARVG models to 8-bit and 6-bit precision while maintaining competitive generative performance, showcasing its efficiency and practicality.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG effectively tackles the key quantization challenges for ARVG models by employing training-free methodologies, offering a significant improvement in model efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a method to improve the fidelity-perception trade-off in diffusion-based image restoration by controlling noise frequency during reverse diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of reduced data fidelity in diffusion-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods caused by noise during reverse diffusion.

Method: A Fourier-domain filter is designed to suppress low-frequency noise while preserving high-frequency components during reverse diffusion, introducing a data-consistency prior for improved fidelity and perception.

Result: The NFCDS approach achieves better fidelity-perception balance without requiring further training and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks.

Conclusion: NFCDS provides a novel and effective method for improving fidelity and perceptual quality in zero-shot image restoration tasks, advancing the utility of diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: The method improves over existing global regularization techniques by focusing on local constraints, showing promise for specific tasks requiring detailed classification.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

*Jianglong Li,Jun Xu,Bingcong Lu,Zhengxue Cheng,Hongwei Hu,Ronghua Wu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a 3D talking face compression framework that achieves high-fidelity visualization at low bitrates using parametric modeling and efficient neural rendering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for efficient and high-quality 3D talking face representation for immersive and interactive communication in video conferencing, which current methods struggle to deliver due to limitations in compression and computational efficiency.

Method: The technique combines FLAME-based parametric facial modeling with 3DGS neural rendering, transmits necessary facial metadata in real time, and employs Gaussian-based head model reconstruction and optimized compression schemes using Gaussian attribute compression and MLP.

Result: The proposed method shows superior rate-distortion performance and delivers high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, designed for real-time operation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in 3D video conferencing by providing high-fidelity and low-bitrate solutions, making it an efficient tool for real-time applications.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

### [135] [GeoRC: A Benchmark for Geolocation Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21278)
*Mohit Talreja,Joshua Diao,Jim Thannikary James,Radu Casapu,Tejas Santanam,Ethan Mendes,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks Vision Language Models (VLMs) on their geolocation prediction and reasoning abilities, showing that while they predict well, their reasoning chains are often flawed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate VLMs not just on their ability to predict global geolocation accurately, but to provide coherent and audit-worthy reasoning chains, as current models struggle in this aspect.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains by collaborating with expert GeoGuessr players to generate 800 ground-truth reasoning chains for 500 street view scenes. They evaluated VLM- and LLM-based scoring strategies against these expert chains.

Result: The results reveal that while closed-source VLMs like Gemini and GPT 5 perform comparably to human experts in geolocation prediction, they lag behind in reasoning chain accuracy. Open-weight VLMs like Llama fail significantly on this benchmark.

Conclusion: There is a noticeable gap between human reasoning and VLMs due to their inability to extract fine-grained visual attributes, underscoring the limitations of current VLM technology for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

### [136] [Token Entropy Regularization for Multi-modal Antenna Affiliation Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21280)
*Dong Chen,Ruoyu Li,Xinyan Zhang,Jialei Xu,Ruoseng Zhao,Zhikang Zhang,Lingyun Li,Zizhuang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for antenna affiliation identification using a multi-modal approach that integrates video footage, antenna features, and PCI signals, addressing challenges through a novel training framework and Token Entropy Regularization technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual process of identifying antenna affiliation is inefficient, error-prone, and cumbersome, necessitating an automated and reliable solution.

Method: The authors propose a multi-modal system that combines video footage, antenna geometry, and PCI signals. A unique Token Entropy Regularization (TER) module is introduced during the pretraining stage to improve representation alignment between modalities.

Result: The proposed approach accelerates convergence and significantly enhances performance in antenna identification tasks. Experimental analysis shows that the entropy of the first token varies based on the modality.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated, multi-modal antenna affiliation identification and highlights the effectiveness of the TER module. It sets the foundation for future advancements in the field, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

*Rishi Upadhyay,Howard Zhang,Jim Solomon,Ayush Agrawal,Pranay Boreddy,Shruti Satya Narayana,Yunhao Ba,Alex Wong,Celso M de Melo,Achuta Kadambi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate and diagnose specific physics concepts in generative world models, ensuring improved physical reasoning and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing physics-based benchmarks which entangle multiple physical concepts, reducing diagnostic specificity, and to create a more reliable framework for evaluating the physical fidelity of generative world models.

Method: WorldBench systematically evaluates generative models through disentangled, concept-specific metrics. It includes tests at two levels: intuitive physical understanding (e.g., object permanence, perspective) and low-level physics properties (e.g., friction and viscosity).

Result: State-of-the-art generative video-based models demonstrate consistent failures in specific physics understanding, highlighting a lack of consistency in physical dynamics and revealing areas for improvement.

Conclusion: By dissecting physical concepts individually, WorldBench provides a nuanced tool to rigorously test and enhance video generation and world models, advancing generalizable world-model training for real-world systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

*Jie Tang,Pingping Xie,Jian Li,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN) to improve depth completion leveraging a hybrid method combining deep learning and probabilistic graphical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively handling sparse and irregular input depth data in deep networks, which limits performance under high sparsity.

Method: A hybrid model called GBPN dynamically constructs a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) using the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) and performs inference using Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP). GMCN predicts adaptive non-local edges to capture long-range dependencies.

Result: GBPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks and demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across varying sparsity levels and patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed GBPN effectively integrates deep learning with probabilistic graphical models, addressing sparsity challenges in depth completion and achieving substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

*Md Nadim Mahamood,Md Imran Hasan,Md Rasheduzzaman,Ausrukona Ray,Md Shafi Ud Doula,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mam-App, a lightweight yet efficient model for diagnosing apple leaf diseases, achieving remarkable performance with low parameter usage, making it suitable for resource-limited devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for increased food production, coupled with the need to minimize losses caused by crop diseases, drives the exploration of efficient diagnosis methods for agricultural health monitoring.

Method: A parameter-efficient deep learning model, Mam-App, based on Mamba architecture, is developed for feature extraction and disease classification, evaluated on various plant disease datasets.

Result: Mam-App performs exceptionally well, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores across Apple, Corn, and Potato Leaf Disease datasets while utilizing minimal parameters (0.051M).

Conclusion: Mam-App strikes a balance between efficiency and performance, proving to be effective for real-time use in resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile devices.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

### [140] [HiFi-Mesh: High-Fidelity Efficient 3D Mesh Generation via Compact Autoregressive Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21314)
*Yanfeng Li,Tao Tan,Qingquan Gao,Zhiwen Cao,Xiaohong liu,Yue Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE) to improve 3D mesh generation by addressing inefficiencies in sequence modeling and proposing faster inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D mesh generation methods suffer from slow inference and are constrained to handling small sequences, limiting their ability to express detailed structures.

Method: LANE leverages compact autoregressive dependencies to extend the generatable sequence length and employs the AdaGraph strategy to enhance inference speed by decoupling spatiotemporal computations.

Result: LANE achieves a sixfold increase in maximum sequence length, faster generation speeds, and better structural detail and geometric consistency compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LANE method offers a significant improvement for high-quality 3D mesh generation by addressing both efficiency and structural detail limitations.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

### [141] [Optimal Transport-Induced Samples against Out-of-Distribution Overconfidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21320)
*Keke Tang,Ziyong Du,Xiaofei Wang,Weilong Peng,Peican Zhu,Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overconfident predictions by DNNs on OOD inputs using a framework based on optimal transport (OT) geometry, specifically by leveraging OT-induced singular boundaries and introducing a novel training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of neural networks making overly confident predictions in open-world or ambiguous scenarios, particularly on OOD inputs.

Method: The authors develop an optimal transport (OT)-based framework to identify singular boundaries where predictions are unreliable. They propose generating OOD samples (OTIS) near these boundaries and introduce a confidence suppression loss during training to improve the model's prediction calibration.

Result: The method reduces OOD overconfidence and demonstrates performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed OT-grounded approach effectively mitigates overconfidence in uncertain regions, boosting the reliability of neural network models in open-world settings.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Pritika Vig,Ren-Chin Wu,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether vision foundation models trained on sampled images capture continuous processes, particularly in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if vision foundation models' latent representations reflect disease progression, enabling better generalization and analysis in computational pathology.

Method: Used diffusion pseudotime to infer developmental trajectories and analyzed trajectory fidelity across cancers using pathology-specific and vision-only models.

Result: Pathology-specific models achieved high trajectory fidelity, with fidelity predicting downstream classification performance. Inferred trajectories aligned with known biological patterns.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models capture continuous processes and trajectory fidelity offers a complementary metric for model evaluation across pathology and other domains.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

### [143] [SR$^{2}$-Net: A General Plug-and-Play Model for Spectral Refinement in Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21338)
*Ji-Xuan He,Guohang Zhuang,Junge Bo,Tingyi Li,Chen Ling,Yanan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight rectifier (SR$^{2}$-Net) to enhance HSI-SR models by improving spectral fidelity and spatial resolution while maintaining efficiency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) enhance spatial resolution but often produce spectral artifacts and lack spectral consistency, resulting in loss of physical plausibility.

Method: The proposed SR$^{2}$-Net is a plug-and-play rectifier that works with existing architectures without modification, using Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) for cross-band interaction and Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) for spectral plausibility.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and diverse backbone models show consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: SR$^{2}$-Net effectively resolves spectral inconsistency issues in HSI-SR enhancement while preserving flexibility and requiring negligible computational resources, showcasing its practical applicability.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

*Ruiqi Liu,Boyu Diao,Zijia An,Zhulin An,Fei Wang,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF), a method for constructing a single robust global adapter to address catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods either suffer from retrieval costs and hindered knowledge transfer due to task-specific parameters or catastrophic forgetting due to naive parameter fusion.

Method: The proposed DAF method derives optimal fusion coefficients using PAC-Bayes theory and Taylor expansion to dynamically integrate task-specific, previous global adapter, and initialization parameters. Additionally, a Robust Initialization strategy is introduced to capture global knowledge patterns.

Result: DAF achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIL benchmarks, validating its ability to balance stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: DAF effectively overcomes standard challenges in CIL by combining a novel fusion mechanism and robust initialization, making it a strong solution for combating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) to improve class-incremental learning by sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-Incremental Learning requires balancing learning new classes without forgetting previously learned ones, but restrictive parameter constraints can harm adaptability.

Method: The SGDS method dynamically sparsifies activation spaces to allocate shared or non-overlapping subspaces for similar and dissimilar classes, respectively, without over-restricting parameters.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SGDS effectively mitigates interference and supports knowledge transfer, advancing solutions for class-incremental learning.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMRMamba introduces an innovative structured state space model for 3D human mesh recovery, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods, which suffer from physically implausible results due to flawed pose anchors and ineffective spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: HMRMamba utilizes a Geometry-Aware Lifting Module with a dual-scan Mamba architecture for stable 3D pose sequences and a Motion-guided Reconstruction Network to improve temporal coherence through kinematic analysis.

Result: HMRMamba achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency on standard benchmarks (3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M) while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: HMRMamba establishes a novel and effective approach to video-based 3D human mesh recovery, solving key limitations of previous methods with enhanced efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in aerial-ground person re-identification caused by geometry distortions between camera views, proposing Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT) for improving similarity computation and incorporating geometry-conditioned prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AG-ReID methods struggle with extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies that induce distortions, invalidating commonly used similarity assumptions.

Method: The authors propose GIQT, a lightweight module to rectify similarity space based on camera geometry, and introduce a geometry-conditioned prompt system for global representation adjustments.

Result: Experiments across four benchmarks show that the approach improves robustness under challenging geometric conditions with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: GIQT effectively addresses distortions in query-key similarity space, enhancing AG-ReID performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed UniMRG method effectively enhances the multimodal capabilities of Unified Multimodal Models, fostering a deeper comprehension of visual inputs through diverse representations.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

### [149] [MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408)
*Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Yue Zhou,Jiaming Zhong,Wei Ye,Wenhui Yi,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Haodong Li,Bo Cao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting high-fidelity AI-generated videos, introducing a hierarchical dual-path framework that exploits residual manifold anomalies and temporal inconsistencies termed 'Manifold Projection Fluctuations.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the difficulty of differentiating between real videos and high-quality AI-generated videos, especially as such synthetic content visually improves. It addresses the need for detecting computational fingerprints where traditional methods may fail.

Method: The framework consists of two paths: 1) The Static Manifold Deviation Branch, using Vision Foundation Models to identify spatial anomalies or deviations from the real-world manifold, and 2) The Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch, analyzing temporal inconsistencies and structured computational artifacts in AI videos.

Result: The proposed framework can expose AI-generated videos, even when they visually appear indistinguishable from real ones, ensuring robust detection of forgeries.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI-generated videos, despite their advanced visual quality, still exhibit distinguishable computational patterns through structured manifold projection fluctuations, making it possible to reliably expose them using the proposed hierarchical framework.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [150] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies the issue of Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD) in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) when handling dense and self-occluding 3D scenes. It suggests a solution using Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper arises from the increasing need to enhance NeRFs for quantitative 3D scene analysis, particularly in challenging dense and self-occluding environments, where traditional methods often fail to accurately reconstruct solid interiors.

Method: The authors propose replacing implicit density fields with an explicit geometric pipeline (Sparse Voxel Rasterization - SVRaster) that utilizes 2D mask projections onto voxel grids and enforces geometric separation via recursive splitting. This approach is initialized with SfM feature geometry to address the degradation issues in NeRFs.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved performance, achieving a 95.8% instance recovery rate in dense clusters compared to 89% with state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs. It also shows greater robustness to degraded segmentation masks, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors, as implemented through the SVRaster pipeline, are essential for reliable 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding environments. This work advances the field by providing a practical approach to overcoming NeRF-related geometric reconstruction limitations.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to transform unimodal datasets into multimodal ones to align pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks, achieving strong performance in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning, which limits the utilization of rich pre-trained representations in neural networks.

Method: The authors introduce synthetic image captions generated by Multimodal Large Language Models, supervised contrastive loss for clustering same-class representations, and a novel inference technique using class-averaged text embeddings.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in extensive experiments across 13 benchmarks, excelling particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: This work presents a paradigm shift for leveraging multimodal pre-training and improves dataset enhancement techniques for fine-tuning, providing significant performance gains in image classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

*Yuxiang Huang,Mingye Li,Xu Han,Chaojun Xiao,Weilin Zhao,Ao Sun,Ziqi Yuan,Hao Zhou,Fandong Meng,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spava, a sequence-parallel framework for efficient long-video inference using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video inference are inefficient due to dense computation in the prefill stage of LMMs, leading to limited acceleration or degraded performance, and preventing LMMs from handling complex videos effectively.

Method: Spava introduces a sequence-parallel framework with optimized approximate attention, distributing computation across multiple GPUs to reduce load and increase parallelism.

Result: Spava achieves significant speedups of up to 12.72x compared to methods like FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Spava enables efficient handling of long, complex videos by improving task performance and delivering substantial acceleration in long-video inference processes.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

*Donghuo Zeng,Hao Niu,Zhi Li,Masato Taya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes seven metric learning losses and their impact on embedding geometry and retrieval performance, introducing diagnostic metrics for comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the effects of different metric learning losses on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics for retrieval tasks.

Method: The study examines seven metric learning losses across five image-retrieval datasets, using diagnostic metrics like variance and greediness to analyze intra-/inter-class variance and gradient dynamics.

Result: Triplet and SCL maintain high within-class variance and inter-class margins for fine-grained retrieval. Contrastive/InfoNCE excels in rapid convergence but oversimplifies structures, while N-pair achieves large mean separation with less uniformity.

Conclusion: Triplet/SCL are ideal for diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination, whereas Contrastive/InfoNCE are better suited for fast embedding compaction.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

*Midou Guo,Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Rui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RT-DeepLoc, a framework for detecting deepfake forgeries over time using weakly-supervised learning via reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deepfakes have become more localized and intermittent, requiring precise methods for temporal localization. Frame-level labels are expensive, making weakly-supervised approaches essential.

Method: RT-DeepLoc uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained only on authentic data to learn spatiotemporal patterns, creating reconstruction discrepancies for fake segments. It incorporates a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL) to enhance feature compactness and generalization.

Result: RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art results for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization, validated through extensive experiments on large datasets, such as LAV-DF.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc effectively addresses weakly-supervised temporal deepfake detection by leveraging reconstruction-based methods and contrastive learning for robust and generalizable performance.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Method: The authors propose LingBot-VA, using Mixture-of-Transformers, a shared latent space for vision and actions, closed-loop rollout mechanisms, and asynchronous inference for efficient control.

Result: LingBot-VA shows strong performance in long-horizon tasks, post-training efficiency, and generalizability in both benchmarks and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The model successfully demonstrates the feasibility of integrating video world models into robot learning and provides significant advancements, with code and models openly shared for further development.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

Motivation: Physicians face challenges in estimating device usage for coronary artery calcifications due to varying patient conditions presented in tabular data.

Method: The paper approaches the task as a Multiple-instance Learning problem and proposes HyperAdAgFormer, a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer that modifies feature aggregation strategies based on tabular data.

Result: Experiments on clinical datasets showed that HyperAdAgFormer is effective in estimating the need for debulking calcifications.

Conclusion: HyperAdAgFormer demonstrates potential in improving personalized medical decision-making for coronary calcification treatment, supported by clinical dataset experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempt to estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications from computed tomography (CT) images. We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimGraph, a unified framework for improved image generation and editing using scene-graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial and semantic coherence in current image generation and editing techniques.

Method: The paper proposes a scene graph-driven method called SimGraph, combining token-based generation with diffusion-based editing for unified and precise control.

Result: Experiments show that SimGraph outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality and consistency.

Conclusion: SimGraph achieves superior image generation and editing with structured control over objects and spatial relationships, integrating these tasks within a unified framework.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HERS, a framework to address challenges in generating reliable text-to-image vehicle damage imagery for safety-critical applications like auto insurance. It emphasizes improved fidelity, controllability, and alignment for trustworthy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over misuse and fraud due to realistic synthesis of crash-like imagery with text-to-image diffusion models in automated insurance processes.

Method: HERS fine-tunes a diffusion model using self-supervised image-text pairs without manual annotation. Experts for different damage types are trained and integrated into a unified model.

Result: HERS demonstrates a 5.5% improvement in text faithfulness and a 2.3% increase in human preference ratings across four diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: HERS enhances reliability and trustworthiness of generative models in high-stakes domains, aiding safe implementation for applications like insurance fraud detection and auditability.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ViK, an attention-free vision backbone inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), achieving competitive accuracy with linear complexity by using a novel token mixer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the quadratic complexity and interpretability issues of attention mechanisms in vision models, and explore alternatives to achieve scalability and efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces ViK, which relies on MultiPatch-RBFKAN for token mixing using patch-wise nonlinear transforms, axis-wise separable mixing, and low-rank global mappings for efficient long-range dependencies.

Result: ViK achieves competitive performance on ImageNet-1K with reduced computational complexity compared to traditional attention-based mechanisms.

Conclusion: KAN-based token mixing offers a promising, efficient, and interpretable alternative to attention-based methods for vision tasks.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver) to accelerate Flow Matching (FM) models, reducing generation latency while maintaining high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome latency bottlenecks in Flow Matching models caused by iterative Ordinary Differential Equation solving, avoiding trade-offs of existing low Neural Function Evaluations solutions.

Method: BA-solver uses a lightweight SideNet alongside a frozen backbone, focusing on Bidirectional Temporal Perception and Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Result: BA-solver achieves high-quality generation with minimal Neural Function Evaluations, reducing computational requirements drastically while maintaining competitive results.

Conclusion: The proposed BA-solver offers a plug-and-play solution that accelerates FM model processes, preserves generation fidelity, and integrates seamlessly with existing frameworks for tasks like image editing.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR methods struggle with conflicting optimization objectives caused by heterogeneous degradations and are limited by coarse-grained control mechanisms or rigid optimization strategies.

Method: The authors propose a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation to model degradation uncertainties and solve the drift singularity problem in standard diffusion bridges. They also introduce dual modulation strategies, including a noise schedule for aligning degradations and a path schedule for adaptive regulation of transport trajectories.

Result: The proposed UDBM outperforms prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse restoration tasks in a single inference step.

Conclusion: UDBM effectively resolves conflicts in AiOIR by modeling uncertainties and optimizing transport dynamics, presenting a highly adaptive and efficient restoration approach.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Motivation: Existing watermarking evaluation methods are inadequate due to lacking a unified framework, poor interpretability, weak security considerations, and inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks.

Method: WMVLM redefines watermark evaluation metrics for residual and semantic types, utilizes latent distribution shifts analysis, and introduces a three-stage training strategy for classification, scoring, and text generation.

Result: WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language models, showing strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: WMVLM represents a significant advancement in image watermarking evaluation, addressing limitations of previous methods and offering improved interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

*Songhan Jiang,Fengchun Liu,Ziyue Wang,Linghan Cai,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoner introduces a large-scale dataset for reasoning with whole-slide images in pathology, enabling visual models to provide transparent and clinically grounded diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack explainable reasoning and verifiable evidence in diagnosis processes, limiting trustworthiness and error correction in medical settings.

Method: PathReasoner creates a large-scale dataset using a knowledge-guided generation pipeline leveraging medical knowledge graphs to align pathological findings with diagnoses. PathReasoner-R1 combines trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning.

Result: PathReasoner-R1 offers state-of-the-art performance on its dataset and public benchmarks, showcasing transparent and structured reasoning capabilities for pathology models.

Conclusion: PathReasoner equips pathology models with enhanced reasoning that is both clinically reliable and transparent, fostering trust and improving diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

### [165] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether different vision models converge towards not only universal representations but also similar intermediate processes during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the similarity among representations of large models extends beyond outputs to include intermediate steps and operations.

Method: The authors compute distances between models' representations across layers and analyze the evolution and distinctions of these distances at various stages of the models.

Result: The study reveals that while similar layer positions across different models produce comparable representations, significant differences exist, particularly on how classifiers and transformer-based models process and discard information.

Conclusion: Different vision models exhibit some convergence in outputs but differ significantly in intermediate processes, highlighting qualitative distinctions in their operations.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

### [166] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fault-Adaptive Routing in Eisenstein-Jacobi Interconnection Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21090)
*Mohammad Walid Charrwi,Zaid Hussain*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores routing strategies for faulty Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, determining RL-based approaches outperform deterministic and optimal algorithms in terms of resilience, efficiency, and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of ensuring high-performance and fault-resilient communication in increasingly dense many-core architectures using interconnection networks, particularly for EJ networks under faulty conditions.

Method: The paper evaluates three routing paradigms: Greedy Adaptive Routing, Dijkstra's algorithm, and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach using a multi-objective reward function.

Result: Greedy routing's performance degrades significantly under faults; Dijkstra achieves higher reachability (52-54%) but involves high computational cost. RL-based routing achieves 94% reachability, 91% packet delivery, and over 90% throughput even under faults, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: RL-based adaptive policies provide an effective and practical solution for maintaining robust communication in faulty EJ networks, achieving a balance between efficiency, resilience, and computational feasibility.

Abstract: The increasing density of many-core architectures necessitates interconnection networks that are both high-performance and fault-resilient. Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.

### [167] [Maxwait: A Generalized Mechanism for Distributed Time-Sensitive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21146)
*Francesco Paladino,Shulu Li,Edward A. Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'maxwait', a coordination mechanism for balancing timing and consistency in distributed time-sensitive systems, subsuming classic methods and enabling enhanced real-time behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed systems face challenges in balancing timing requirements and consistency, especially with communication delays and uncertainties. There is a need for mechanisms that improve this tradeoff.

Method: The paper presents the 'maxwait' mechanism, which makes tradeoffs between timing and consistency explicit and configurable, subsuming existing distributed system approaches. It is implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca language.

Result: Maxwait facilitates classical methods and common distributed patterns, enhances control over timing, fault detection, determinism, and logical-time consistency in distributed systems.

Conclusion: Maxwait offers a unified semantic framework for distributed time-sensitive systems, improving timing control and fault handling beyond classical methods.

Abstract: Distributed time-sensitive systems must balance timing requirements (availability) and consistency in the presence of communication delays and synchronization uncertainty. This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.

*Yuchen Yang,Yaru Zhao,Pu Yang,Shaowei Wang,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZipMoE, a memory-efficient and semantically lossless system for using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices, capable of reducing inference latency and improving throughput significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enhance large language models, but their high memory needs hinder deployment on resource-limited edge devices. There is a need for a solution that allows model effectiveness without resorting to lossy quantization.

Method: ZipMoE employs a caching-scheduling co-design that leverages statistical redundancies in MoE and hardware properties of edge devices to optimize performance. This design transforms on-device MoE inference from being I/O-limited to compute-centric, enabling enhanced parallelism.

Result: The prototype of ZipMoE demonstrated up to a 72.77% reduction in inference latency and a 6.76x increase in throughput compared to existing systems, based on evaluations on edge platforms and real-world workloads.

Conclusion: ZipMoE provides a practical approach for implementing memory-efficient and high-performance MoE models on edge devices without sacrificing semantic fidelity, fundamentally addressing scalability concerns for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

*Adithya Bhat,Harshal Bhadreshkumar Shah,Mohsen Minaei*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes Ira, a framework to improve consensus latency in primary-backup replication by accelerating backup replay with hints from the primary node.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck caused by backup nodes replaying transactions too slowly in primary-backup replication systems.

Method: The Ira framework transmits compact hints from the primary to backups during transaction batch execution, with a focus on Ethereum block execution.

Result: Using Ira-L, backups demonstrated a median per-block speedup of 25× in replay time, reducing aggregate replay time significantly against baseline performance.

Conclusion: Ira effectively improves backup replay efficiency, showing significant performance improvement while imposing manageable overheads that can be optimized further in practical deployments.

Abstract: In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.
  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.
  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

*Bronislav Sidik,Chaya Levi,Joseph Kampeas*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EWSJF is an adaptive scheduler that enhances Large Language Model performance by improving throughput and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scheduling policies, such as FCFS, lead to inefficiencies like high tail latency and underutilized hardware when handling mixed workloads (interactive queries and batch requests) in LLMs.

Method: Developed EWSJF, a scheduler with unsupervised algorithms, dynamic routing, scoring prioritization, and optimization using live feedback, targeting efficiency and fairness in request handling.

Result: EWSJF improved throughput by over 30% and reduced latency for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS when implemented in vLLM.

Conclusion: Learning-based request scheduling like EWSJF is essential for optimizing LLM performance in mixed workload conditions.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

*Chuan-Chi Lai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SA-PSKY proposes a self-adaptive framework for efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query processing in edge-cloud systems, overcoming limitations of traditional static threshold methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of sensor data in IoE and the inefficiencies of static filters in edge computing create resource conflicts, necessitating dynamic and efficient solutions.

Method: The paper formulates a dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient agent to optimize resource usage in real-time.

Result: The framework achieves up to 60% reduction in communication overhead and 40% reduction in response time while maintaining scalability across diverse data distributions.

Conclusion: SA-PSKY is a scalable and efficient solution for probabilistic skyline queries in dynamic edge-cloud environments, outperforming traditional approaches in both communication and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

TL;DR: The paper explores Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), providing theoretical guarantees for its validity in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs. Experiments confirm Gaussian convergence within few BP iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical guarantees for Gaussian approximations in GBP applied to non-Gaussian, complex factor graphs, which are common in spatial AI applications.

Method: The authors leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to mathematically prove Gaussian convergence in loopy factor graphs meeting four specific assumptions. They validate this experimentally with a stereo depth estimation task.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms convergence to Gaussian distributions under specified conditions, and experimental results show that beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after a few BP iterations.

Conclusion: Gaussian approximations in GBP are theoretically valid and experimentally effective in non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs under the given assumptions.

Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASH enhances LLM-driven heuristic design by co-optimizing solver mechanisms and runtime efficiency to address convergence and adaptation challenges in combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven heuristic design (LHD) struggles with endpoint-only evaluation and high adaptation costs, limiting efficiency and practicality.

Method: DASH combines a convergence-aware metric for solver optimization and employs Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) for cost-effective re-adaptation of solvers.

Result: DASH improves runtime efficiency by 3x, surpasses state-of-the-art solution quality, and reduces LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, efficient method for improving combinatorial optimization solvers, addressing both runtime and adaptation challenges effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a method for improving multimodal pretraining with a focus on a target modality during fine-tuning. It enhances downstream performance without extra data or compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many pretrained multimodal models treat all modalities equally, often under-optimizing representations for crucial target modalities used during fine-tuning.

Method: FIP biases representation learning to a designated target modality using strategies like higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality.

Result: FIP improves fine-tuned performance in multimodal tasks, tested on wireless signals, without requiring additional data or computational resources.

Conclusion: FIP is simple, architecture-compatible, and boosts downstream performance, making it broadly applicable across multimodal modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Method: The study integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model on a dataset of 450 samples to generate and filter candidates. Density functional theory simulations validate four out of six promising candidates identified.

Result: The framework generates 1,000 candidate metal hydrides, ranks and filters them, and identifies six novel formulas and structures. Four are validated and show strong potential for further experimental investigation.

Conclusion: This scalable and efficient framework contributes to expanding hydrogen storage datasets, aiding materials discovery, and supporting carbon-neutral energy technologies.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of circuit design have limitations in navigating large design spaces and rigorously verifying large-scale performance-driven discoveries. This paper aims to overcome these challenges using AI.

Method: PowerGenie integrates an automated analytical framework for assessing theoretical limits and converter functionality without simulation, along with an evolutionary finetuning approach to co-evolve a generative model through fitness selection and uniqueness checks.

Result: PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable power converter with 23% higher FoM compared to existing topologies. SPICE simulations confirm efficiency gains of up to 17% in a single mode and average gains of 10% across modes.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective in automated discovery of superior converter topologies, addressing mode collapse and overfitting while providing accessible code for broader use.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and knowledge isolation caused by fixed prompt allocations in current continual learning systems.

Method: The authors propose a global prompt pool coupled with a gated routing mechanism for dynamic prompt sharing, alongside a history-aware modulator for cumulative prompt activation monitoring.

Result: The new approach enhances performance and efficiency compared to static prompt allocation strategies, as confirmed by extensive analysis and empirical studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively advances prompt-based continual learning by optimizing parameter utilization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TwinWeaver, a framework leveraging large language models for forecasting clinical events, achieving competitive results in oncology prediction tasks over longitudinal studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of clinical event forecasting and risk stratification in precision oncology by addressing challenges associated with sparse and multi-modal clinical time-series data.

Method: The authors developed TwinWeaver, a framework that converts longitudinal patient histories into text for training large language models. They built Genie Digital Twin (GDT), based on this framework, using data from 93,054 patients with 20 cancer types.

Result: The Genie Digital Twin (GDT) outperformed traditional time-series baselines, achieving lower forecasting errors (median MASE of 0.87) and higher accuracy in event prediction (average C-index of 0.703). It also generalized well to clinical trials, showing promising results without additional training.

Conclusion: TwinWeaver and GDT demonstrate significant improvement in clinical event prediction, providing a scalable, interpretable, and effective tool for precision oncology applications.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

### [180] [Noisy but Valid: Robust Statistical Evaluation of LLMs with Imperfect Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20913)
*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework, "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing, to reliably certify large language models (LLMs) even with noisy and biased judge systems by using a human-labeled calibration set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of reliably certifying LLMs, ensuring their failure rates are below safety thresholds, especially since imperfections in LLM judges can undermine statistical guarantees.

Method: The method employs a small, human-labeled calibration set to estimate the judge’s TPR/FPR. Using these estimates, the authors derive a variance-corrected threshold applied to a larger, judge-labeled dataset for valid hypothesis testing with Type-I error control.

Result: The framework is validated empirically through experiments on datasets like Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech, and SafeRLHF. The results reveal the 'Oracle Gap,' quantifying the performance cost of judge estimation and highlighting diagnostics for judge reliability.

Conclusion: This framework provides interpretable diagnostics of noisy judge behavior, guarantees statistical validity, and advances understanding of trade-offs and power in statistical evaluations of LLM certifications.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning methodology for noninvasive intracranial pressure estimation using multiple signals and achieves notable estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating intracranial pressure (ICP) noninvasively is a critical challenge in the field of critical care, as it can improve patient outcomes by enabling less invasive monitoring.

Method: The study developed a machine learning framework leveraging a subspace system identification algorithm for cerebral hemodynamics model simulations and a convex optimization-based mapping function to connect noninvasive signal features with estimation errors.

Result: About 31.88% of test cases achieved an estimation error within 2 mmHg, while 34.07% had errors within 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg when using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that noninvasive ICP estimation using the proposed machine learning approach is feasible, laying groundwork for further refinement and validation for clinical use.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

### [182] [A Theory of Universal Agnostic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20961)
*Steve Hanneke,Shay Moran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a complete theory for optimal universal rates in agnostic binary classification, describing four fundamental convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the existing theory of universal rates in binary classification by removing the assumption of realizability, which limits its applicability.

Method: The authors identified a tetrachotomy of optimal convergence rates ($e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow) and used combinatorial structures to categorize concept classes.

Result: A full characterization of concept classes based on their optimal convergence rates and the identification of simple combinatorial determinants for these rates were achieved.

Conclusion: The work generalizes the theory by addressing the agnostic setting, offering broader insights into the universal rates of convergence in binary classification.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [183] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the integration of learned models into the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm for solving monotone optimisation problems, bypassing traditional challenges by introducing Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like POA require explicit definitions of objective and constraint functions, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios where data is the primary input.

Method: The authors devise HM-RI networks that predict the projection primitive for POA through a radial inverse approach, replacing the traditional bisection procedure. They also propose relaxed monotonicity constraints to reduce training complexity.

Result: The approach achieves significant computational speed-ups and high-quality solutions across various monotone optimisation benchmarks, outperforming methods that ignore monotonic structures.

Conclusion: The integration of HM-RI networks into POA offers an efficient, theoretically sound, and practical method for solving data-driven monotone optimisation problems.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

### [184] [DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824)
*Xinwei Qiang,Hongmin Chen,Shixuan Sun,Jingwen Leng,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DASH, a method to address the performance loss caused by determinism in attention backward pass during LLM training by proposing optimal scheduling strategies, achieving up to 1.28x throughput improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in LLM training requires determinism, but this comes with a performance cost due to inefficient scheduling and hardware underutilization in deterministic attention operations.

Method: The paper frames the deterministic attention backward pass as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduling problem and proposes two strategies: Descending Q-Tile Iteration and Shift Scheduling, to reduce pipeline stalls and optimize computation.

Result: The proposed DASH strategies significantly improved throughput in deterministic attention backward operations by up to 1.28x over baseline methods when evaluated on NVIDIA H800 GPUs.

Conclusion: DASH bridges the gap in deterministic attention performance, boosting efficiency in reproducible LLM training, and the methods and code are publicly available for adoption.

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method merging active inference with distributional reinforcement learning to improve control in complex environments efficiently, addressing sensory state organization and action planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve robotic systems' efficiency in complex environments, overcoming limitations like sample inefficiency in traditional reinforcement learning.

Method: A formal abstraction is developed to integrate active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, eliminating the need for transition dynamics modeling while combining model-based and model-free approaches.

Result: The integration provides performance advantages from active inference in reinforcement learning without relying on modeling transition dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper exemplifies a promising step in enhancing AI's capability to handle dual challenges in robotic environments through innovative framework integration.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-trained encoder for child development analysis using UNICEF data, achieving significant performance with minimal samples and enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address preventable developmental delays in children and overcome the data bottleneck preventing effective machine learning deployment in new countries.

Method: The approach involves creating a pre-trained encoder using data from 357,709 children across 44 countries and utilizing transfer learning for few-shot generalization in child development analysis.

Result: The pre-trained encoder performs better than traditional methods even with few samples, achieving high AUC scores in unseen countries and demonstrating success in zero-shot deployment.

Conclusion: Pre-trained encoders are effective for global child development monitoring and can enhance feasibility for resource-constrained settings, supporting UN SDG goals.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

### [187] [Top-k on a Budget: Adaptive Ranking with Weak and Strong Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20989)
*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of identifying the top-k items when high-quality evaluations are costly and introduces an adaptive approach to minimize strong oracle queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from scenarios where exact valuations (through strong, high-fidelity oracles) are expensive, and the goal is to efficiently identify top-k items by leveraging a combination of noisy, fast weak oracles and scarce strong oracles.

Method: The proposed methods include a baseline approach called screen-then-certify (STC), an adaptive certification algorithm (ACE), and a fully adaptive two-phase method (ACE-W). ACE minimizes strong oracle calls by focusing queries on critical boundary items, and ACE-W further adapts the weak oracle budget before applying ACE.

Result: The authors provide theoretical guarantees, showing that ACE achieves the same asymptotic bound as STC in terms of strong oracle calls while reducing them in practice. ACE-W further enhances efficiency by adaptively allocating weak oracle resources.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive methods like ACE and ACE-W yield significant reductions in strong oracle calls without compromising accuracy, making them effective strategies in costly evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate reward discovery in Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO), aiming to remove human design bias and risks of reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias and risks associated with manually-designed reward functions in MetaBBO, and to improve effectiveness and efficiency in optimization.

Method: An LLM-based program search process is used with an evolutionary paradigm for effective reward discovery. Multi-task evolution architecture ensures parallel reward discovery across multiple tasks, leveraging knowledge sharing to speed up convergence.

Result: The discovered reward functions enhance existing MetaBBO methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving optimization outcomes.

Conclusion: Automated reward discovery using LLMs shows promise in overcoming design biases and improving performance in MetaBBO, highlighting the critical role of well-designed rewards in this field.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies energy and inference time in generative AI with extensive measurements and proposes a framework for understanding and optimizing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate understanding and diagnosis of energy consumption differences in ML tasks for optimization.

Method: Large-scale measurement study with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs, followed by the development of a framework linking energy and time to latent metrics like memory and utilization.

Result: Findings revealed significant energy variations across task types (up to 100x between tasks) and demonstrated the influence of various algorithmic, software, and hardware factors on energy consumption.

Conclusion: A comprehensive framework was developed to analyze energy consumption, aiding in energy optimization and applicable to datacenter metrics like throughput per watt.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

### [190] [The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994)
*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies architecture-conditioned neural scaling laws, finding that width should grow faster than depth in language models, and establishes optimal depth-width tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how language model architecture impacts loss reduction by analyzing depth and width in parameter scaling.

Method: Proposes architecture-conditioned scaling laws, introduces terms for critical depth, and validates the findings empirically with experiments on 30 transformer architectures.

Result: Width should grow 2.8 times faster than depth; excessive depth reduces performance due to the critical depth phenomenon, confirmed with high R^2 across tested models.

Conclusion: Optimal depth-width tradeoffs are crucial in language models, as going beyond a critical depth harms performance even at large scales.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unsustainable energy growth in AI has driven the need for alternatives like neuromorphic computing and physics-based training that are more energy-efficient, addressing constraints in connectivity.

Method: The authors trained an XY model with equilibrium propagation using locally connected lattices while analyzing performance and response evolution over benchmark tasks.

Result: Sparse, locally connected networks proved to perform comparably to densely connected networks, despite fewer connections.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that equilibrium propagation can scale effectively in realistic, sparse architectures, offering a path for energy-efficient AI solutions.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to address the iterative, resource-constrained nature of real scientific discovery processes in materials science.

Method: The authors formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns, evaluating algorithms under constraints such as oracle budgets, and allows for flexible configurations of discovery agents.

Result: Through systematic experiments, the framework evaluates discovery pipelines' components, highlighting their scalability and efficiency in complex systems.

Conclusion: MADE provides a comprehensive and flexible platform for benchmarking and advancing end-to-end autonomous workflows in materials discovery, fostering innovation in scientific methodologies.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces two benchmarks for Operations Research (OR) that evaluate iterative diagnostic and behavioral rationality loops, rather than one-shot problem-solving. Domain-specific training enables significant performance improvement in model resolution, accuracy, and bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing OR benchmarks that evaluate only one-shot problem-to-solver translation, omitting the iterative diagnostic loop crucial for debugging infeasible models.

Method: Two benchmarks, ORDdebug and ORBias, are proposed. ORDebug evaluates self-corrective actions on 5,000+ problems and ORBias assesses rationality through deviations in systematic policies. The evaluations use a solver-in-the-loop strategy to provide deterministic feedback.

Result: Customized domain-specific training achieved an 8B model surpassing state-of-the-art APIs. Metrics include a 95.3% recovery rate (+9.1%), improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.6%, 1.7 times faster resolution, and a 48% reduction in systematic bias in curriculum training.

Conclusion: Process-centric evaluations with verifiable oracles lead to better training outcomes, allowing smaller models with targeted training to outperform larger generic models.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

### [194] [Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics for Robust Streaming Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21012)
*Young Kyung Kim,Oded Schlesinger,Qiangqiang Wu,J. Matías Di Martino,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA), an approach that incorporates temporal dynamics into Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), demonstrating improvements in prediction accuracy across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Adaptation methods usually overlook the temporal dynamics in test data streams, which can provide supervisory signals to improve model adaptation.

Method: OATTA uses gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation with a dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine predictions. Additionally, a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) ensures safety by reverting to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent.

Result: OATTA demonstrates universal applicability and improves accuracy by up to 6.35% across tasks like image classification, signal analysis, and sentiment analysis, outperforming standard TTA methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal dynamics into TTA offers critical and orthogonal improvements over traditional order-agnostic approaches, making OATTA a versatile and efficient solution to distribution shift.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

### [195] [Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21021)
*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new generative model called Conditional Denoising Model (CDM) to improve physical consistency in surrogate modeling without relying on explicit physics constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current surrogate modeling methods, which struggle to balance physical consistency and data-fitting accuracy, and often fail to guarantee strict adherence to governing equations.

Method: The Conditional Denoising Model (CDM) learns the geometry of the physical solution manifold by training a network to denoise states. This denoising process transforms noisy approximations into points on the valid physical subspace using a deterministic fixed-point iteration.

Result: CDM produced results with greater parameter and data efficiency compared to physics-consistent baselines and adhered to physical constraints more strictly, despite not explicitly incorporating governing equations during training.

Conclusion: CDM offers an effective method to model physical systems with improved physical consistency and efficiency, leveraging a denoising objective that acts as an implicit regularizer of the governing physical laws.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIGMA-PPG, a generative model addressing redundancy and noise in PPG signals using a novel adversarial masking mechanism and semantic consistency constraints. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in current PPG signal modeling, such as noise, redundancy, and lack of morphological precision in masked or contrastive methods.

Method: The proposed SIGMA-PPG employs Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking using reinforcement learning to create robust learning paths and integrates semantic consistency via vector quantization to enhance feature mapping.

Result: SIGMA-PPG, pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, outperformed five state-of-the-art approaches across 12 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG is an effective solution for improving PPG signal analysis through innovative masking and semantic modeling, offering better performance in diverse applications.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

### [197] [Predict-Project-Renoise: Sampling Diffusion Models under Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21033)
*Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Gilles Louppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to enforce hard constraints like physical laws during the sampling process of neural emulators based on diffusion models using an algorithm called Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla diffusion models lack the ability to ensure physical accuracy or satisfy hard constraints during generation, which limits their applicability in scientific domains.

Method: The paper proposes a constrained sampling framework utilizing a constrained forward process and the Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) algorithm. The framework alternates between denoising, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising to ensure constraint satisfaction.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution, as shown through experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The constrained sampling approach effectively ensures physical accuracy and constraint satisfaction in diffusion models, enhancing their utility for scientific and physics-constrained applications.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

### [198] [Supervised Guidance Training for Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20756)
*Elizabeth L. Baker,Alexander Denker,Jes Frellsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the use of score-based diffusion models in infinite-dimensional function spaces for sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems, introducing a novel method for efficient and stable posterior sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to extend the applicability of score-based diffusion models to Bayesian inverse problems defined in infinite-dimensional function spaces, where conditioning these models on posterior distributions remains an open challenge.

Method: The authors develop a framework based on an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's h-transform, decomposing the conditional score into an unconditional score and a guidance term. They also propose a novel training objective, Supervised Guidance Training, to circumvent the intractable guidance term.

Result: The paper provides a theoretical solution for conditioning diffusion models in infinite-dimensional function spaces and demonstrates its efficacy with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: This study offers the first method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models in function space to accurately sample from posterior distributions, contributing a significant advancement to the theory and practice of Bayesian methods in function spaces.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

*Chengzu Li,Zanyi Wang,Jiaang Li,Yi Xu,Han Zhou,Huanyu Zhang,Ruichuan An,Dengyang Jiang,Zhaochong An,Ivan Vulić,Serge Belongie,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the use of video generation models for visual reasoning, focusing on tasks like Maze Navigation and Tangram Puzzle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of Vision-Language Models in fine-grained spatial understanding, continuous action planning, and complex visual reasoning.

Method: The study evaluates video generation models' intermediate reasoning capabilities in sequential discrete planning and continuous manipulation tasks.

Result: Three insights were observed: robust zero-shot generalization, effective utilization of visual contexts, and a test-time scaling law improving planning in complex paths.

Conclusion: Video generation is proposed as a powerful paradigm for scalable and generalizable visual reasoning beyond traditional media applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

*Yiqiao Liao,Farinaz Koushanfar,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACO, a framework that bridges generalizable and instance-specific neural combinatorial optimization by enabling effective test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization methods either generalize across instances but lack adaptability or optimize instance-specific models but miss inductive biases, leading to inefficiencies. A unified approach is needed.

Method: The authors propose TACO, a model-agnostic framework using strategic warm-starting to partially retain trained parameters while allowing instance-specific adaptation during test-time.

Result: TACO achieves better solution quality than existing methods without significant computational overhead, as demonstrated on Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique problems under various conditions.

Conclusion: TACO effectively combines the strengths of generalizable and instance-specific neural combinatorial optimization, offering practical and robust solutions for challenging optimization tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

*Haokun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMKC, a framework for anomaly detection in multivariate time series with dynamic sensor structures, leveraging fixed-size feature hashing and hybrid kernel imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in multivariate time series anomaly detection caused by sensor churn, where observed variables change dynamically over time, violating conventional static input assumptions.

Method: The authors propose SMKC, a framework that uses permutation-invariant feature hashing to create fixed-size state sequences, hybrid kernel imagery for temporal structure, and learning through masked reconstruction and teacher-student objectives.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that log-distance channels are more effective for discriminatory signals than cosine representations, and the proposed SMKC-based detection approach using random projections performs competitively with trained baselines without requiring gradient updates.

Conclusion: SMKC provides an effective and practical anomaly detection solution under dynamic sensor conditions, offering a cold-start capability for environments with limited resources.

Abstract: Conventional anomaly detection in multivariate time series relies on the assumption that the set of observed variables remains static. In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments.

*Alexandre Larouche,Audrey Durand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUBo-GFN, a new method combining submodularity and Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) to optimize generative model training efficiently, outperforming classical GFNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to harness the structure of submodular rewards to address the challenge of learning to sample compositional objects in GFNs and improve efficiency in training generative models.

Method: The work leverages submodularity to establish reward upper bounds for unobserved objects, using them to compute optimistic training data while minimizing queries to the reward function. This leads to the SUBo-GFN framework.

Result: SUBo-GFN requires significantly fewer reward queries to achieve better distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on submodular tasks compared to classical GFNs.

Conclusion: The integration of submodularity principles into GFNs through SUBo-GFN results in a more efficient training process and generates higher-quality outputs, applicable to synthetic and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Motivation: There is a need to improve time-to-solution in Ising machines by solving challenges like restricted hardware topology, inefficient spin update methods, and limited coupling-coefficient precision, which negatively impact performance.

Method: The study introduces Snowball, a digital Ising machine featuring dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection, asynchronous spin updates, and wide coupling precision, implemented on an AMD accelerator card.

Conclusion: Snowball demonstrates that addressing key challenges in digital Ising machine designs, including scalable precision and efficient update algorithms, can significantly enhance optimization performance.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative human-LLM framework for feature engineering in tabular learning that utilizes human feedback and explicit modeling of operation utility to optimize performance, avoiding repeated exploration of ineffective transformation operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based feature engineering approaches rely heavily on LLMs as black-box optimizers, which often lack mechanisms for accurately prioritizing promising operations, resulting in inefficiencies.

Method: The framework decouples LLM-generated operation proposals from operation selection. Selection is guided by utility and uncertainty modeling, with human expert feedback incorporated selectively to refine the process in early-stage feature engineering.

Result: Evaluations on synthetic and real user studies show improved feature engineering performance across diverse tabular datasets and reduced cognitive load for users during the process.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging human expert input alongside LLM capabilities enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of automated tabular feature engineering processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

*Augusto Santos,Teresa Santos,Catarina Rodrigues,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning approach for early detection of emergent phenomena, focusing on hidden causal structures within complex systems to predict and explain critical events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to detect emergent phenomena such as epileptic seizures, customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks early, which arise from hidden causal interactions, while also uncovering latent structures in data.

Method: The proposed method leverages a one-parameter family of estimators based on the empirical covariance or precision matrix to uncover causal structures. Afterward, a supervised learning mechanism classifies these learned representations.

Result: The researchers demonstrated competitive results in seizure detection and churn prediction tasks, showing structural consistency and good identifiability. The method captured structural signatures, combining predictive performance with interpretable statistics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their method balances predictive performance with interpretability, offering a principled way to uncover latent causal structures in complex systems and enabling explainability alongside early event detection.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

*Anders Gjølbye,Ida Kargaard,Emma Kargaard,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the behavior and limitations of Partial Least Squares (PLS-SVD) in multimodal datasets with entry-wise missing data, revealing phase transitions in its ability to recover shared structure based on signal-to-noise ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by missing entries in multimodal datasets, particularly in understanding how PLS-SVD can recover shared structures under such conditions.

Method: Authors analyze PLS-SVD under a spiked model with missing-completely-at-random masking, using normalized cross-covariance and deriving asymptotic overlap formulas for signal recovery.

Result: The study identifies a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a signal-to-noise threshold, singular vectors are uninformative; above it, they align with latent directions. Results are supported with simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: PLS-SVD's ability to recover shared structures in paired data diminishes with missing entries, with recovery determined by the signal-to-noise ratio. This behavior is predictable through derived formulas.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

*Minghui Chen,Wenlong Deng,James Zou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP) to address issues like exploding and vanishing textual gradients in deep, multi-module AI systems, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in deep, long-horizon AI workflows, such as performance degradation caused by exploding and vanishing textual gradients during message propagation.

Method: The TEP approach employs two phases: (1) a 'free phase' where local modules iteratively refine prompts, and (2) a 'nudged phase' using controlled prompt edits with task-level objectives to improve performance without relying on global textual backpropagation.

Result: TEP demonstrates improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to global propagation methods, particularly in long-horizon question answering and tool-use benchmarks.

Conclusion: TEP effectively mitigates signal degradation in deep AI systems by facilitating local prompt optimization and controlled adaptation, making it a practical solution for enhancing modular AI workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

TL;DR: This paper establishes optimal convergence rates for Q-learning in average-reward Markov decision processes by introducing a "lazy" transformation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in analyzing Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes due to the lack of contraction and limitations of current techniques that rely on strong assumptions or inefficient approximations.

Method: The authors introduce a lazified dynamics where the system remains in the same state with a fixed probability. They analyze this modified system under a reachability assumption, leveraging instance-dependent seminorms to demonstrate one-step contraction of the Bellman operator.

Result: Achieved optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for both synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning in average-reward Markov decision processes.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel method for establishing optimal sample complexity in Q-learning by addressing fundamental challenges related to the absence of contraction, offering practical and efficient solutions.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

### [209] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21067)
*Haoyang Li,Haibo Chen,Xin Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews graph foundation models focused on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, discussing challenges, strategies, pretraining approaches, and open research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning models struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions due to distribution shifts in graph structures and task formulations. There is a need for models capable of general-purpose representation learning across various graphs and tasks.

Method: The survey organizes approaches based on their capacity to generalize under fixed or heterogeneous task specifications, examining OOD handling strategies, pretraining goals, and evaluation protocols.

Result: The survey provides an overview of existing OOD strategies in graph foundation models, offering a unified framing and highlighting gaps in the field.

Conclusion: This work establishes itself as the first comprehensive survey on OOD generalization in graph foundation models, identifying challenges and open research directions.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

### [210] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates partial-feedback online learning, focusing on scenarios where sublinear regret is attainable, characterizing minimax regret, introducing new dimensions like PFLdim and PMSdim, exploring deterministic versus randomized learnability, and addressing intractable cases beyond set realizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in online learning with partial feedback scenarios, such as language generation, where multiple valid labels exist but learners only observe a single correct label each round. This necessitates new dynamics for understanding regret and learnability.

Method: The paper introduces dimensions like Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to characterize minimax regret and learnability for deterministic and randomized learners. Broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized approaches are also identified.

Result: Precise bounds and characterizations for minimax regret and learnability are established for both deterministic and randomized learners. A sharp separation is shown for intractable scenarios outside set realizability, highlighting issues with existing complexity measures.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of partial-feedback online learning by showcasing tight bounds for sublinear regret in set-realizable cases while emphasizing the need for new noise-sensitive complexity measures outside this regime.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

### [211] [LOCUS: Low-Dimensional Model Embeddings for Efficient Model Exploration, Comparison, and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21082)
*Shivam Patel,William Cocke,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOCUS introduces a system to succinctly represent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using embeddings that streamline integration, evaluation, and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanding ecosystem of LLMs creates challenges in efficiently managing diverse models and optimizing queries. This demands a scalable and adaptable solution for embedding and retrieval.

Method: LOCUS employs an attention-based encoder to transform query encodings and evaluation scores into embeddings, allowing for refined integration and model routing without retraining. It includes a correctness predictor leveraging these embeddings.

Result: LOCUS achieves superior routing accuracy, generates meaningful embedding spaces, and significantly reduces query evaluation samples, outperforming baselines by up to 4.8x.

Conclusion: LOCUS provides an innovative framework for model management, comparison, and application with minimal resource usage, enabling enhanced organization and functionality in LLM ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Haoyang Liu,David Simchi-Levi,Will Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on semi-supervised stochastic optimization utilizing predictions from pre-trained models alongside labeled data. It introduces PPI-SVRG, showing theoretical stability and empirical effectiveness in improving performance under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in semi-supervised learning where labeled data is limited, leveraging predictions from pre-trained models for optimization stability and improved performance.

Method: Combine two variance reduction techniques, PPI (uses predictions from pre-trained models) and SVRG (uses reference gradients), into a unified approach termed PPI-SVRG. Formally analyze its convergence properties.

Result: PPI-SVRG maintains convergence stability under prediction imperfections and achieves significant improvements in mean estimation benchmarks and test accuracy under limited labeled data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed PPI-SVRG successfully integrates prediction-based and gradient-based variance reduction techniques, offering theoretical convergence robustness and practical performance enhancements, even under scarce label conditions.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

*Marvin Sextro,Weronika Kłos,Gabriel Dernbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MapPFN is a meta-learning model designed to estimate perturbation effects, adapting to unseen biological contexts without gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell perturbation datasets and existing methods are limited in adapting to new biological contexts, leading to challenges in identifying underlying mechanisms from limited contexts.

Method: The authors introduce MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) meta-trained on synthetic gene perturbation data. It employs in-context learning to predict post-perturbation outcomes without requiring conventional gradient-based model updates.

Result: MapPFN effectively identifies differentially expressed genes and demonstrates performance comparable to models trained on real experimental data, despite being pretrained solely on synthetic data.

Conclusion: MapPFN proves capable of adapting to new biological contexts and inferring the effects of perturbations, enabling advancements in biological intervention modeling.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

### [214] [Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Siyang Gao,Hanwei Li,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy to handle biased proxies and scarce ground-truth resources in fixed-confidence best-arm identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying the best arm when relying on cheap, biased proxies and selectively acquired ground-truth labels.

Method: The authors design an estimator combining proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and confidence sequences, complemented by an adaptive auditing algorithm concentrating audits on unreliable contexts.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show mis-selection probabilities reduce, and numerical experiments demonstrate efficiency and improved performance.

Conclusion: This method effectively corrects bias, makes efficient use of audit resources, and provides reliable identification in complex fixed-confidence scenarios.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

*Minjae Kwon,Josephine Lamp,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates safe RL algorithms under distribution shifts in diabetes management, exposing a safety generalization gap and proposing test-time shielding to restore safety, improving outcomes and reducing risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore how training-time safety guarantees of RL algorithms transfer to deployment, particularly under distribution shifts in safety-critical contexts like diabetes management.

Method: A unified clinical simulator is used to benchmark safe RL algorithms. The authors introduce test-time shielding based on learned dynamics models to filter unsafe actions.

Result: Test-time shielding significantly improves safety and effectiveness of RL algorithms, achieving Time-in-Range gains and reducing clinical risk indicators across diverse diabetes types and populations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of addressing safety generalization gaps in RL under distribution shifts, and test-time shielding is shown to be an effective solution. The provided simulator and benchmark serve as tools for future research.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

### [216] [TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135)
*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a novel framework for learning causal mechanisms that transition continuously, achieving better performance in capturing such dynamics compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal representation learning methods often assume abrupt shifts between mechanisms, but real-world scenarios like vehicle dynamics and human motion involve continuous transitional mechanisms.

Method: The method models transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of atomic mechanisms with time-varying mixing coefficients. TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework, learns individual atomic mechanisms to recover mechanism trajectories even for unobserved states.

Result: TRACE achieves up to 0.99 correlation in recovering mixing trajectories on both synthetic and real-world data, outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Conclusion: TRACE is suitable for identifying and modeling continuously transitioning mechanisms, extending beyond typical discrete-switching scenarios to uncover unobserved transitional states.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

### [217] [More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522)
*Sagi Meir,Tommer D. Keidar,Noam Levi,Shlomi Reuveni,Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Reset-and-Discard (ReD) to improve the efficiency of querying large language models (LLMs), reducing costs while increasing coverage@cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics like pass@k fail to account for diminishing returns, making it inefficient to optimize on a fixed budget.

Method: The authors establish a link between pass@k and coverage@cost using power-law behavior and propose ReD to improve efficiency by increasing coverage@cost regardless of the pass@k form.

Result: Experiments on three large language models using HumanEval show that ReD significantly reduces the required attempts, tokens, and costs while enabling power-law inference.

Conclusion: The proposed ReD method saves attempts and costs while offering a way to efficiently measure inference power-laws, making it a practical improvement for querying LLMs under budget constraints.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

### [218] [Smooth Dynamic Cutoffs for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21147)
*Kevin Han,Haolin Cong,Bowen Deng,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic cutoff mechanism for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to reduce inference time and memory consumption while maintaining simulation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs face limitations in inference speed and memory consumption, preventing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The authors aim to overcome these challenges by rethinking the fixed cutoff radius approach.

Method: The study proposes a dynamic cutoff mechanism that adjusts the cutoff radius to target a specific number of neighboring atoms, enabling sparsity in atom graphs. This is implemented in four MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet.

Result: Implementing the dynamic cutoff achieved up to 2.26x lower memory usage and 2.04x faster inference time with minimal accuracy trade-offs on materials and molecular datasets.

Conclusion: The dynamic cutoff mechanism effectively addresses MLIP bottlenecks of speed and memory while maintaining performance. All implementations and training codes will be open-sourced to the community.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

### [219] [Graph-Free Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21359)
*Luan Pham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a framework for effective Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in complex systems without the need for a dependency graph, achieving significant improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing RCA methods that fail to account for fault propagation due to dependency graph absence, which causes inaccuracies when identifying the root cause during failures.

Method: Develop a simple and efficient RCA framework named PRISM, backed by theoretical guarantees, tailored for component-based systems to mitigate propagation-based anomaly misidentification.

Result: PRISM demonstrates superior performance with 68% Top-1 accuracy across 735 failures from 9 real-world datasets, outperforming the best baseline by 258% and diagnosing failures in only 8ms.

Conclusion: PRISM proves to be an effective and efficient solution for RCA in the absence of dependency graphs, significantly enhancing diagnosis accuracy and reducing processing time.

Abstract: Failures in complex systems demand rapid Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to prevent cascading damage. Existing RCA methods that operate without dependency graph typically assume that the root cause having the highest anomaly score. This assumption fails when faults propagate, as a small delay at the root cause can accumulate into a much larger anomaly downstream. In this paper, we propose PRISM, a simple and efficient framework for RCA when the dependency graph is absent. We formulate a class of component-based systems under which PRISM performs RCA with theoretical guarantees. On 735 failures across 9 real-world datasets, PRISM achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy, a 258% improvement over the best baseline, while requiring only 8ms per diagnosis.

### [220] [Sampling-Free Privacy Accounting for Matrix Mechanisms under Random Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21636)
*Jan Schuchardt,Nikita Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to privacy amplification in differentially private model training by using methods based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition, avoiding the limitations of sampling-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing sampling-based approaches for computing privacy amplification parameters, such as lack of deterministic guarantees, random abstention, and high sample requirements.

Method: The paper develops sampling-free bounds using Rényi divergence and conditional composition, leveraging a dynamic programming formulation for efficient computation and providing stronger guarantees in specific cases.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates better efficacy through numerical comparisons, showing broad applicability to various matrix mechanisms used in private model training.

Conclusion: The new methods present a deterministic and more efficient approach to privacy amplification, offering more robust performance, particularly for small epsilon and general matrix mechanisms.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

*Maria Despoina Siampou,Shushman Choudhury,Shang-Ling Hsu,Neha Arora,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that combines textual data and human mobility insights to create detailed representations of points-of-interest (POIs) based on their real-world usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POI representations primarily rely on place identity from metadata or trajectory contexts, neglecting the actual function or usage patterns of the POIs.

Method: The authors propose ME-POIs, which integrates textual embeddings with human mobility data using temporally contextualized embeddings, contrastive learning, and a mechanism for handling sparsity through spatial propagation.

Result: ME-POIs achieves superior performance over text-only and mobility-only baselines on five map enrichment tasks, demonstrating its ability to effectively represent POI identity and function.

Conclusion: POI function is a vital aspect for generalizable and accurate representations; ME-POIs successfully leverages this component to enhance multi-task POI understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

*Henry Kvinge,Andrew Aguilar,Nayda Farnsworth,Grace O'Brien,Robert Jasper,Sarah Scullen,Helen Jenne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether neural networks trained on fixed mathematical tasks can uncover broader mathematical structures, finding some abstract algebraic properties are captured and others aren't.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance mathematical progress using AI by moving beyond simple question answering and investigating the broader mathematical structures captured by neural networks.

Method: Experiments involved training neural networks on predicting group operations and testing them for understanding abstract algebraic concepts such as commutativity or subgroups.

Result: The study found models captured some algebraic properties like commutativity and subgroup distinctions, but struggled with others, such as identifying the identity element.

Conclusion: Neural networks trained on specific mathematical tasks have potential to uncover abstract structures, but their capabilities may vary across different mathematical properties.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PARADIS, a physics-inspired weather model combining advection, diffusion, and reaction for enhanced and efficient global weather prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic architectures in machine learning models for weather forecasting struggle with efficiently modeling advection and other physical processes, requiring costly computation.

Method: Introduces PARADIS, which uses functional decomposition with advection (through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator), diffusion (via spatial mixing), and reaction mechanisms for better forecasting.

Result: PARADIS achieves state-of-the-art forecast accuracy with significantly reduced training costs, outperforming traditional and ML-based models such as ECMWF HRES and GraphCast.

Conclusion: PARADIS demonstrates that physics-inspired methods can provide high-efficiency and accurate weather forecasting with lower computational resources.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring differential privacy in various settings, specifically for vector- and matrix-valued queries, using randomized mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyze differential privacy properties of the Wishart projection mechanism through theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations, including non-asymptotic guarantees and membership inference attacks. They also study both noise-free and noisy variants of the mechanism.

Result: The study finds that the mechanism provides strong privacy guarantees for vector-valued queries but not for matrix-valued ones in the noise-free setting. By adding noise, the mechanism delivers better privacy via randomness and low-rank projections. LoRA-style updates are identified as a specific application, with implications for their privacy properties.

Conclusion: The Wishart projection mechanism can ensure differential privacy under certain conditions. However, care must be taken, especially in matrix-valued settings, as it is not inherently private without noise. LoRA-style updates benefit from privacy amplification, offering a balance between privacy and accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

*Michael Ibrahim,Nagi Gebraeel,Weijun Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedGEM, a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, to tackle federated clustering with unknown and overlapping local clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve federated clustering challenges where the number of clusters K and their overlaps across clients' data are unknown, while maintaining efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Method: The method involves local EM steps at clients, uncertainty set construction for each component, and a central server inferring global clusters via closed-form computations. Theoretical guarantees and specific isotropic GMM applications are also discussed.

Result: FedGEM achieves comparable performance with centralized EM and surpasses existing federated clustering methods, as shown in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that FedGEM is an effective and theoretically grounded method for federated clustering addressing unknown and overlapping cluster issues.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

*Jinjun Peng,Magnus Saebo,Tianjun Zhong,Yi-Jie Cheng,Junfeng Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Simin Chen,Yangruibo Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) to improve Small Language Models (SLMs) for coding, surpassing limitations found in the existing Task-Centric Learning paradigm by emphasizing deep understanding of software environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Small Language Models lack the ability to generalize effectively with complex and unfamiliar codebases, limiting their utility in coding scenarios within resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors introduce Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), which emphasizes training models on deeper, domain-specific software repositories rather than diverse, task-focused datasets. They also develop a model, SWE-Spot-4B, trained with repository-specific interactive signals.

Result: SWE-Spot-4B demonstrates performance surpassing larger open-weight models (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-30B) and matching certain efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini) across various software engineering tasks. It also achieves higher training efficiency and lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Repository mastery through RCL proves to be a critical and complementary dimension for achieving efficient and capable coding models, addressing the limitations of current SLMs.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

*Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Jose I. Mestre,Manuel F. Dolz,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why Adam optimizer performs better when β₁=β₂, attributing it to gradient scale invariance, and provides theoretical and empirical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address an observed but unexplained phenomenon: training performance improves for Adam optimizer when the momentum parameters β₁=β₂, requiring a theoretical explanation.

Method: Formalize the notion of gradient scale invariance and prove that Adam becomes scale-invariant of first order only when β₁=β₂. Supporting experiments were conducted across tasks and architectures.

Result: The analysis showed that β₁=β₂ aligns with gradient scale invariance. Experimental results confirmed smoother gradient rescaling effects and improved performance across tasks.

Conclusion: The study resolves an open question about Adam's behavior, offering a principled explanation and guidance for the design of future optimizers.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

### [228] [Efficient Simple Regret Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21167)
*Shuai Liu,Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Botao Hao,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents new algorithms for stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective, achieving improved regret bounds and validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of simple regret guarantees in stochastic contextual logistic bandits and improve computational efficiency with practical algorithms.

Method: The paper develops a self-concordant analysis-based algorithm achieving regret bounds independent of κ and introduces tailored Thompson Sampling methods for both linear and logistic cases.

Result: The deterministic algorithm achieves a regret of \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})\), while the randomized Thompson Sampling algorithms achieve \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})\), validated by empirical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed deterministic and randomized algorithms provide state-of-the-art simple regret performance for stochastic contextual bandits, with computational advantages and validated theoretical claims.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

*Fernando Palafox,Jingqi Li,Jesse Milzman,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for learning in unknown dynamical systems, providing a generalized cost for active information gathering that integrates various modeling choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for active information gathering are restricted by bespoke costs tailored to specific models, limiting flexibility and generalization.

Method: The authors present a framework that decouples modeling choices from information-gathering costs, using Massey's directed information to craft a general cost. They also demonstrate how mutual information-based costs are a special case of their generalized cost.

Result: They establish theoretical links between mutual information-based costs and Bayesian estimation, and validate their framework through experiments across different system types.

Conclusion: The proposed framework simplifies and unifies active learning approaches, offering theoretical and practical advantages for system learning.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: ECSEL is an explainable classification method using compact signomial equations. It surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in symbolic regression benchmarks with less computation and provides interpretable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for interpretable classification methods with formal, compact representations, and improved efficiency in recovering target equations.

Method: ECSEL directly constructs structural, closed-form signomial equations as classifiers and explanations, focusing on interpretability and computational efficiency.

Result: ECSEL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in symbolic regression benchmarks, achieves competitive classification accuracy, and provides insights such as dataset biases and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: ECSEL successfully balances interpretability and accuracy in classification models, with valuable real-world applications in e-commerce and fraud detection.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

*Kamal Berahmand,Saman Forouzandeh,Mehrnoush Mohammadi,Parham Moradi,Mahdi Jalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AC2L-GAD, an active counterfactual contrastive learning framework for graph anomaly detection that balances efficiency and performance by addressing augmentation and sampling shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve graph anomaly detection, which struggles with label scarcity and class imbalance, by overcoming limitations of random augmentations and naive negative sampling in graph contrastive learning.

Method: AC2L-GAD incorporates information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation to create semantically consistent and informative contrasts while optimizing computational efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate AC2L-GAD's competitive or superior performance on nine benchmark datasets, with significant improvement in scenarios involving complex anomaly interactions and a 65% reduction in computational cost.

Conclusion: The AC2L-GAD framework effectively balances efficiency and detection quality, providing a robust solution for graph anomaly detection that outperforms existing methods in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Kexuan Xin,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses entity alignment (EA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) by proposing a foundation model that solves the reasoning horizon gap in EA via a parallel encoding strategy and other innovations. It exhibits strong generalization to unseen KGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of existing EA models that lack transferability and struggle with aligning unseen KGs without retraining.

Method: The authors introduced a parallel encoding strategy that leverages seed EA pairs as anchors, incorporates a merged relation graph, and uses a learnable interaction module to facilitate precise matching.

Result: Experiments showed that the proposed framework effectively enhances entity alignment and generalizes well to unseen KGs.

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses reasoning horizon challenges in EA, offers strong generalization capabilities, and demonstrates potential for improving KG fusion.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

*Xin Peng,Ang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow Perturbation++ improves unbiased Boltzmann sampling in high-dimensional systems by reducing estimator variance while maintaining unbiasedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of CNFs in high-dimensional unbiased Boltzmann sampling caused by the computationally expensive Jacobian-determinant evaluation and the tradeoff between bias and variance in existing stochastic Jacobian estimators.

Method: Developing Flow Perturbation++, which uses a variance-reduced version of Flow Perturbation, applies discretized probability-flow ODEs, and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step.

Result: Flow Perturbation++ achieves lower estimator variance and improves equilibrium sampling performance on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and an all-atom Chignolin protein compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++ effectively overcomes the variance issues of unbiased Jacobian estimation methods while maintaining scalability and unbiased Boltzmann sampling performance.

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

*Jinhang Chai,Xuyuan Liu,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a transfer learning framework for structured matrix estimation, focusing on scenarios where ambient and intrinsic representations grow. It builds a new estimator and validates its performance theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to manage expanding ambient dimensions and latent structures in learning systems and efficiently transfer knowledge from source to higher-dimensional target tasks.

Method: The paper proposes an anchored alternating projection estimator that separates source embedding, low-rank innovations, and sparse modifications, providing deterministic error bounds under growing dimensions.

Result: The framework theoretically improves rates under specific conditions and is validated through structured problems like Markov transition matrix and covariance estimation, showcasing consistent transfer gains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in handling structured matrix estimation with representation growth, leveraging transfer learning for better performance in target tasks.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

*Xin Peng,Ang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR), a post-hoc refinement framework to correct biases in generative models, achieving remarkable sample quality enhancement without perturbing original sampling dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models suffer from systematic biases, especially in high-dimensional data, leading to degraded sample quality. The authors aim to address this issue efficiently to enhance fidelity and diversity.

Method: The paper proposes a Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) framework involving two strategies: (1) latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and (2) data space refinement with lightweight augmentations. Importantly, it avoids perturbing sampling dynamics and applies deterministic corrections to output.

Result: Their experiments show substantial improvement in fidelity and coverage of generated samples on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ. Notably, BFR achieved a state-of-the-art FID of 1.46 on MNIST with minimal computational cost using 1 function evaluation.

Conclusion: The BFR framework successfully enhances sample quality in generative models, providing an efficient post-hoc methodology that is computationally light and preserves original sampling trajectories.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel domain adaptation method for cross-subject SSVEP-based BCIs to achieve enhanced decoding accuracy, addressing signal variability and annotation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy in decoding SSVEP signals in brain-computer interfaces by addressing signal variability across subjects and high annotation costs.

Method: The paper introduces a self-training-based domain adaptation method, combining Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) to utilize frequency information, a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework with Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL) and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), and a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to improve feature discriminability.

Result: The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Benchmark and BETA datasets in decoding SSVEP signals across various signal lengths.

Conclusion: This study's novel domain adaptation framework significantly improves cross-subject SSVEP signal decoding performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

*Gloria Felicia,Michael Eniolade,Jinfeng He,Zitha Sasindran,Hemant Kumar,Milan Hussain Angati,Sandeep Bandarupalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces StepShield, a benchmark that evaluates when safety violations in AI agents are detected, emphasizing early intervention over post-mortem analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for agent safety fail to distinguish between early detection (which enables corrective action) and late detection (which only aids forensic analysis). This distinction is critical for improving AI safety.

Method: StepShield evaluates the timeliness of detecting safety violations using a dataset of 9,213 agent trajectories and introduces three new metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. It compares the performance of different detection systems.

Result: StepShield reveals significant differences in detection methods—LLMs achieve a higher EIR (59%) compared to static analyzers (26%), showing the importance of evaluating time-specific detection.

Conclusion: StepShield shifts safety evaluation towards identifying violations earlier, demonstrating its feasibility and economic benefits, such as reduced monitoring costs with the HybridGuard system. The benchmark sets a new direction in developing secure and cost-effective AI agents, with provided data and code (Apache 2.0 license).

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for analyzing feature behavior in geometric and topological deep learning, providing insights into feature diffusion and aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of how features distribute and diffuse during training in geometric and topological deep learning models.

Method: The authors leverage cellular sheaf theory to model local feature consistency and harmonicity in graph-based architectures, and propose a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis to analyze hierarchical interactions.

Result: The framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and introduces a multiscale approach for analyzing graph models, aiding tasks like node classification and community detection.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances understanding of feature-driven dynamics in geometric and topological architectures, paving the way for improved analysis of these systems.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Motivation: The goal is to understand the interaction between model architectures and temporal context in decoding naturalistic EEG data and to identify trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

Method: Five architectures (CNN, LSTM, EEGXF, S4, S5) were benchmarked on a 4-class task using the HBN movie-watching EEG dataset across different segment lengths (8s to 128s), with explorations of cross-subject generalization, out-of-distribution performance, and frequency-shift robustness.

Result: The S5 model achieved the highest accuracy (98.7%) with fewer parameters than CNN, while EEGXF demonstrated better robustness under certain conditions such as frequency shifts. Each model showed strengths and weaknesses in efficiency, accuracy, and uncertainty handling.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between parameter efficiency and robustness: S5 is optimal for peak accuracy and efficiency, while EEGXF performs better in scenarios requiring robustness and conservative uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

### [240] [Optimistic Transfer under Task Shift via Bellman Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21924)
*Jinhang Chai,Enpei Zhang,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses online transfer reinforcement learning challenges in episodic Markov decision processes by introducing a method that improves source-task data reuse while overcoming systematic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in online reinforcement learning when reusing experience from related source tasks due to task similarity being traditionally measured by rewards or transitions, rather than Bellman regression targets.

Method: The authors propose a re-weighted targeting (RWT) method, which corrects transition mismatches via retargeting continuation values. It aligns tasks using one-step Bellman alignment and integrates a two-stage framework for variance reduction and bias correction.

Result: The proposed RWT $Q$-learning framework achieves regret bounds based on the task shift's complexity instead of the target MDP's complexity. Empirical results show consistent improvement over single-task learning and naïve pooling in both tabular and neural network contexts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that one-step Bellman alignment is an effective model-agnostic principle for transfer in online reinforcement learning, enabling statistically valid reuse of source-task data with robust performance.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

*Daniel T. Bernstein,Luca Di Carlo,David Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'soft quantization', a method of applying short-range attractive couplings during neural network training to achieve model quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses the challenge of quantizing neural network weights efficiently, while maintaining performance, through a novel and flexible training method.

Method: The method applies short-range attractive couplings to the neural network weights during training, introducing two hyperparameters to induce mixed-precision weight discretization.

Result: The proposed 'soft quantization' method achieves better performance compared to traditional histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20 using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Conclusion: Soft quantization offers a flexible way to compress models and provides insights into balancing model compression with generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Kendra Givens,Peilun Li,Thomas Beckers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHDME, a diffusion model framework for forecasting dynamical trajectories under sparse observations and incomplete physics knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with sparse data, and existing physics-informed approaches often require explicit governing equations, which are not always fully available in complex dynamics.

Method: The framework employs a Gaussian process-based port-Hamiltonian system to generate a physics-based dataset for training a diffusion model. It also integrates structured physics residual loss and uses split conformal calibration for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and physical consistency under data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: PHDME effectively combines sparse data and incomplete physics for reliable trajectory forecasting, enhancing both accuracy and physical reliability.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

*Luwei Sun,Dongrui Shen,Jianfe Li,Yulong Zhao,Han Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper offers a framework for approximating ratio-type functionals in conditional generative modeling using deep neural networks with SignReLU activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target density exists as a ratio of two kernel-based densities, motivate the study.

Method: A theoretical framework that focuses on approximating ratio functionals using SignReLU neural networks, with established bounds and convergence rates.

Result: Develop a neural estimator for DDPM reverse processes, providing KL risk bounds and error analysis for generalization guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework ensures practical training guarantees for finite-sample diffusion-based generative models by addressing approximation and estimation challenges.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: STAER is a framework addressing catastrophic forgetting and temporal misalignment in spiking neural networks for class-incremental learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks face challenges like catastrophic forgetting and temporal misalignment when applied to lifelong learning tasks, necessitating solutions for better performance.

Method: STAER integrates Soft-DTW alignment loss and temporal mechanisms to preserve spike timings and improve robust representation learning, using a ResNet19 spiking backbone.

Result: STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10 while matching/exceeding baseline ANN methods, supported by empirical results and ablation studies.

Conclusion: STAER improves spiking neural networks for scalable lifelong learning by addressing temporal alignment, paving the way for biologically plausible solutions with strong performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are inherently suited for continuous learning due to their event-driven temporal dynamics; however, their application to Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has been hindered by catastrophic forgetting and the temporal misalignment of spike patterns. In this work, we introduce Spiking Temporal Alignment with Experience Replay (STAER), a novel framework that explicitly preserves temporal structure to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. Our approach integrates a differentiable Soft-DTW alignment loss to maintain spike timing fidelity and employs a temporal expansion and contraction mechanism on output logits to enforce robust representation learning. Implemented on a deep ResNet19 spiking backbone, STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10. Empirical results demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms strong ANN baselines (ER, DER++) while preserving biologically plausible dynamics. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit temporal alignment is critical for representational stability, positioning STAER as a scalable solution for spike-native lifelong learning.

TL;DR: BioNIC, a neural network model inspired by biological constraints, achieves comparable performance to conventional models in emotion classification using FER-2013.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage biological insights from cortical structures and connectomics to inform and improve artificial intelligence systems, particularly in emotion classification.

Method: BioNIC incorporates architectural and functional constraints inspired by mouse Primary Visual Cortex, such as adjacency mask-derived connectivity, Hebbian learning, homeostatic regulation, synaptic noise, and convolutional layers for spatial processing.

Result: BioNIC achieved an accuracy of 59.77% on the FER-2013 dataset, comparable to conventional models despite its biologically constrained design.

Conclusion: Integrating biological constraints derived from connectomics is a viable way to develop AI systems, showcasing the utility of connectomics in advancing both neuroscience and AI.

Abstract: We present BioNIC, a multi-layer feedforward neural network for emotion classification, inspired by detailed synaptic connectivity graphs from the MICrONs dataset. At a structural level, we incorporate architectural constraints derived from a single cortical column of the mouse Primary Visual Cortex(V1): connectivity imposed via adjacency masks, laminar organization, and graded inhibition representing inhibitory neurons. At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013. Our findings demonstrate that integrating constraints derived from connectomics is a computationally plausible approach to developing biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems. This work also highlights the potential of new generation peta-scale connectomics data in advancing both neuroscience modeling and artificial intelligence.

### [246] [Diversifying Toxicity Search in Large Language Models Through Speciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20981)
*Onkar Shelar,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quality-diversity (QD) extension, ToxSearch-S, for generating high-toxicity prompts for large language models while increasing diversity of attack strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box approaches to prompt search for identifying failures in large language models tend to converge on a small number of high-performing prompts, failing to capture diverse failure modes.

Method: The proposed method, ToxSearch-S, implements a speciation-based QD approach, creating and maintaining multiple high-toxicity prompt niches using capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool, and species-aware parent selection for exploration and exploitation.

Result: ToxSearch-S achieved higher peak toxicity scores (up to 0.73), broader semantic topic coverage, more diverse prompt attack strategies, and better separation in embedding space compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The speciation approach of ToxSearch-S effectively uncovers a wider range of adversarial prompts and provides meaningful partitions in the adversarial search space for large language models.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt search is a practical black-box approach for red teaming large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often collapse onto a small family of high-performing prompts, limiting coverage of distinct failure modes. We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.

### [247] [Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation: Aligning Language Models Without Ground-Truth Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21268)
*Micah Rentschler,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: RLME is a reinforcement learning approach for training large language models without requiring explicit ground-truth labels, instead deriving improvement signals from meta-evaluation by natural-language evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for training LLMs often rely on ground-truth labels or external verifiers, which limit scalability and feasibility when clear correctness is unavailable or expensive.

Method: RLME uses meta-questions to elicit judgments from a natural-language evaluator, treating the positive probability of these responses as reward signals, and employs group-relative policy optimization to update the generator.

Result: RLME achieves comparable accuracy to label-based training, supports controllable multi-objective outcomes, promotes reliable reasoning, and adapts effectively to open-domain tasks without ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: RLME expands the scalability and capability of reinforcement learning for LLMs by enabling effective training in settings where traditional ground-truth labels are impractical or unavailable.

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEXUS, a framework achieving mathematical equivalence between ANNs and SNNs, addressing accuracy loss in conventional SNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNN methods compromise accuracy by approximating continuous values, while combining energy efficiency and precision remains challenging.

Method: NEXUS utilizes IF neuron logic gates for IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic, spatial bit encoding, hierarchical gate circuits, and surrogate-free STE training.

Result: NEXUS achieves identical accuracy to ANNs (0% degradation), significant energy reductions (27-168,000x), and robustness against potential leakage and synaptic noise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates bit-exact equivalence to ANNs, eliminates the usual trade-offs in SNNs, and achieves high energy efficiency suitable for neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100\% accuracy across all decay factors $β\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $σ=0.2$ with >98\% gate-level accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of synergy between neuroscience and AI caused by infrastructural incompatibility, such as AI's lack of biophysical realism and neural simulation tools' unsuitability for modern AI frameworks.

Method: Development of BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning, offering optimized neuronal dynamics on GPUs and scalable solutions for neuromorphic deployment.

Result: BrainFuse enables achievements like simulating 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a neuromorphic chip at low power consumption, and improved AI robustness via biological models.

Conclusion: BrainFuse acts as a transformative platform fostering interdisciplinary research, facilitating the creation of next-gen bio-inspired intelligent systems.

Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: ABOM introduces a new black-box optimization approach that eliminates the reliance on predefined task distributions by adapting parameters online and achieving zero-shot optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning for black-box optimization is often hindered by the need for extensive handcrafted training tasks, which limits its practicality in unknown task distributions.

Method: The proposed ABOM framework uses online parameter adaptation without requiring predefined task distributions. It integrates a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism where evolutionary operators self-update by leveraging optimization data from the target task.

Result: ABOM demonstrates competitive performance on synthetic benchmarks and UAV path planning problems, achieving zero-shot optimization with no need for handcrafted training tasks.

Conclusion: ABOM simplifies black-box optimization by autonomously adapting optimization parameters, proving its efficacy in real-world tasks and eliminating dependency on handcrafted training tasks.

Abstract: Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.

*Zijie Xu,Zihan Huang,Yiting Dong,Kang Chen,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of ANN-to-SNN conversion for Reinforcement Learning (RL), focusing on continuous control, and proposes a method called CRPI to mitigate performance issues due to error amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to efficiently perform in continuous control tasks in RL without requiring costly and unsafe training processes, which is currently limited by poor performance of existing ANN-to-SNN conversion methods.

Method: The authors introduce Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a training-free mechanism that transfers residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress error accumulation and improve performance in converted SNNs.

Result: Their experiments demonstrated that integrating CRPI into existing adaptation pipelines successfully mitigates performance degradation, even in challenging continuous control tasks with both vector and visual observations.

Conclusion: The study establishes continuous control as a critical benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion and demonstrates that CRPI effectively addresses the amplified error challenge, providing significant performance recovery.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of non-differentiability, trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility in training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) while incorporating predictive coding, a key biological principle.

Method: The paper proposes a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron that generates prediction currents based on input-output history, modulating membrane potential to create continuous gradient flow for stability and improved performance.

Result: The method demonstrated consistent performance improvements across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances SNNs in terms of training efficiency, biological plausibility, and performance, making it broadly applicable in advancing SNN-based systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated design system for Black-Box Optimization (BBO) benchmarks, called Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), which leverages large language models and program evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of manually crafted BBO benchmarks, which can lack diversity and objectivity while being susceptible to expert bias.

Method: EoB employs a large language model to iteratively evolve benchmark programs based on bi-objective optimization: maximizing landscape diversity and algorithm-differentiation ability.

Result: The proposed EoB system is demonstrated to be effective in creating diverse and objective benchmarks, validating its utility across multiple use cases like benchmarking BBO algorithms and extending proxies for complex real-world problems.

Conclusion: Automated benchmark design through EoB enhances diversity, objectivity, and usability in BBO applications, reducing the need for human intervention and addressing biases inherent in manual crafting approaches.

Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.

*Kirill Antonov,Teus Tukker,Tiago Botari,Thomas H. W. Bäck,Anna V. Kononova,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDG-EA, a novel lens optimization framework that efficiently generates diverse and competitive optical lens designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard optimizers in lens design, which often converge to a single local optimum and overlook alternative solutions crucial for engineering.

Method: LDG-EA uses a two-stage approach: partitioning the design space by behavior descriptors and applying a probabilistic model to focus evaluation efforts, followed by Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm for local minima discovery and refinement.

Result: LDG-EA produces 14500 candidate minima across 636 unique descriptors in a one-hour computational timeframe, outperforming CMA-ES in diversity.

Conclusion: LDG-EA enhances solution diversity while maintaining competitive performance, making it suitable for multimodal lens optimization within practical budgets and time constraints.

Abstract: Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon traditional heuristic-based software pipelining by providing a more optimal and explanatory approach for VLIW processors.

Method: The researchers used a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver to develop an optimal software pipeliner for loop optimization.

Result: Their approach outperforms both heuristic algorithms and manual optimization methods. Additionally, it provides feedback on infeasible initiation intervals.

Conclusion: Using an SMT Solver not only achieves optimal software pipelining but also aids in better understanding the limitations of certain schedules for programming and processor design.

Abstract: Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in efficiently updating roadmap graphs in dynamic environments with high accuracy.

Method: Introduced the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm that classifies nodes and edges as valid, invalid, or unknown using computational geometry and heuristic checks.

Result: Preliminary experiments show the method improves accuracy and edge classification, outperforming the traditional approach by Leven and Hutchinson while maintaining runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances roadmap updates for robot motion planning, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

### [259] [Track-centric Iterative Learning for Global Trajectory Optimization in Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21027)
*Youngim Nam,Jungbin Kim,Kyungtae Kang,Cheolhyeon Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for optimizing autonomous racing trajectories for better lap times under uncertain vehicle dynamics, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for autonomous racing optimization focus on dynamics learning for trajectory tracking without considering updates to the trajectory itself based on learned dynamics, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The paper uses a track-agnostic parametric representation with wavelet transforms, Bayesian optimization for evaluating lap times with learned dynamics, and an iterative framework for refining trajectories based on real-world data.

Result: The method showed up to a 20.7% lap time improvement over a nominal baseline and outperformed state-of-the-art approaches consistently.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significant potential in optimizing full-horizon autonomous racing trajectories under uncertain dynamics by combining innovative trajectory representation, optimization techniques, and iterative learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve AI-based industrial inspection safety and perception, overcoming the limitations of current datasets that lack real-world data, multimodal sensing, and fine-grained annotations.

Method: The researchers developed InspecSafe-V1, a dataset using real-world data from 41 inspection robots across five industrial scenarios, including multimodal data such as infrared, audio, and radar point clouds.

Result: The dataset includes segmentation annotations, semantic scene descriptions, safety level labels, and multimodal sensing data, enabling robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning.

Conclusion: InspecSafe-V1 fills a critical gap in industrial safety assessments by providing a rich, real-world, multimodal dataset to advance predictive maintenance and safety in industrial AI systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a disturbance-aware control framework for robotic blimps, using moving mass mechanisms and advanced estimators to enhance stability in windy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic blimps offer safe and durable aerial operation but are vulnerable to wind disturbances, necessitating an adaptive and robust flight control framework.

Method: The paper uses a moving horizon estimator (MHE) to estimate wind effects and a model predictive controller (MPC) for trajectory regulation. A 2-DoF moving-mass mechanism is utilized for both aerodynamic and inertial adjustments.

Result: The integrated MHE-MPC framework performs significantly better than traditional PID control under headwind and crosswind conditions, as evidenced by flight experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves stability and control of LTA blimps in windy environments, reflecting its potential for addressing wind-related challenges in LTA systems.

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and challenges in current fragmented and task-specific synthetic data pipelines, enabling scalable and sustained generalization of embodied intelligence.

Method: Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture with decoupled execution stages, dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, and fault tolerance for optimized resource utilization.

Result: Achieved a 2-3X improvement in throughput compared to unoptimized baselines, ensuring robust operation in large-scale setups.

Conclusion: Nimbus is a high-throughput, scalable framework that integrates diverse pipelines and supports cross-domain data synthesis, powering InternData production.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based framework to improve multi-task robot manipulation efficiency by using reusable skills and adaptive expert activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task robot manipulation faces challenges with scalability and efficiency when using diffusion-based policies requiring large models and extensive demonstrations.

Method: The proposed SMP learns orthogonal skill bases through a mixture-of-experts framework, integrates sticky routing for task-relevant expert activation, and employs variational training objectives to support efficient sampling.

Result: SMP demonstrates higher success rates and significantly lower inference costs compared to conventional large diffusion-based models in both simulation and real-world multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: SMP offers a solution for scalable and transferable multi-task manipulation by enabling reusable skill learning, targeted activation of task-relevant experts, and rapid task adaptation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Motivation: Control systems often face challenges in ensuring safety in real-time for complex dynamical tasks, especially without accurate system knowledge.

Method: A Quadratic-Program safety filter is trained using neural networks with contraction-based losses for the safety value and its derivative by integrating Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and model-free learning.

Result: The safety filter reduces failures before convergence and improves learning speed, achieving higher returns compared to strong baselines, in various dynamical systems and reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: Deep QP Safety Filter provides an effective solution for safe control, offering a practical and principled approach for model-free systems.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPTune, a hierarchical proactive tuning framework aimed at improving parameter updates in MPC motion planners through new evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies in parameter tuning of MPC motion planners, which historically rely on myopic evaluations and suffer from sparse failure event feedback.

Method: HPTune employs a two-level tuning approach: fast-level using predictive risk indicators and slow-level with extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. It integrates Doppler LiDAR for better motion predictions.

Result: Experimental results in high-fidelity simulations show that HPTune enables efficient MPC tuning and outperforms baseline methods in complex environments.

Conclusion: HPTune provides situation-adaptive motion planning, enhancing safety and agility in collision avoidance strategies for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Combines efficient large-scale pretraining with SAC and safe adaptation for humanoid robots using model-based methods which reduce risks during finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient fine-tuning for humanoids limits applications in real-world environments.

Method: Utilizes off-policy SAC for large-batch, high UTD-ratio pretraining and model-based methods for safe adaptation by separating data collection from stochastic exploration.

Result: Achieved zero-shot deployment of SAC pretrained policies on real robots, with effective adaptation in new environments using safe exploration methods.

Conclusion: Integrating pretraining with off-policy RL and safe model-based fine-tuning achieves efficient, robust humanoid control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The study proposes a method to optimize robotic grasping in space environments and demonstrates significant improvement in task success rates through reinforcement learning in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotic systems face challenges like high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and poor generalization, especially in unstructured environments. This study focuses on addressing these limitations using the example of space-based grasping.

Method: The paper introduces a control policy learned directly in a latent manifold that integrates multi-modal input for decision-making. Using GPU-accelerated physics simulation and reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic), the method aims to improve task success rates under diverse grasping conditions.

Result: The approach achieves over 95% task success within 1M environment steps, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to new conditions, and adaptability to object, gripper, and environmental differences.

Conclusion: Reasoning in latent space enhances robotic grasping efficiency and robustness under varying conditions. The paper outlines remaining challenges and offers insights for improving adaptability in unstructured environments like space.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

*Weitao An,Qi Liu,Chenghao Xu,Jiayi Chai,Xu Yang,Kun Wei,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a navigation system called DSCD-Nav that employs a debate mechanism to enhance decision-making for household robots in unfamiliar environments, improving action reliability and navigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robots to adaptively navigate indoor environments with minimal errors and redundant exploration due to limitations in existing one-shot, overconfident decision-making systems.

Method: The DSCD-Nav mechanism uses two stances—Task-Scene Understanding (for scene and goal cues) and Safety-Information Balancing (for risk and exploration)—to cross-check actions with grounded arguments. A Navigation Consensus Arbitration agent integrates these stances and employs micro-probing to resolve uncertainties.

Result: DSCD-Nav led to consistent improvements in navigation success, path efficiency, and reduced redundant exploration across multiple benchmarks (HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, MP3D).

Conclusion: Using a cooperative debate mechanism enables a more reliable and effective navigation decision process in household service robots, showcasing potential for better real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

### [271] [Singularity-Free Lie Group Integration and Geometrically Consistent Evaluation of Multibody System Models Described in Terms of Standard Absolute Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21413)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for using Lie group integrators with standard equations of motion in multibody systems and proposes a method to incorporate rigid body motion geometry into simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multibody system modeling struggles with singularity-free parameterization for spatial motions during time integration, and current methods are incompatible with Lie group integrators without major code restructuring.

Method: The paper introduces a framework to combine Lie group integrators with standard equations of motion and uses local-global transition maps to update absolute coordinates based on Lie group configurations.

Result: The framework successfully integrates Lie group methods with standard multibody system formulations, allowing compatibility and enhanced handling of spatial motion geometry.

Conclusion: This approach enables multibody systems to leverage the advantages of Lie group integrators without massive code base changes, providing a novel and practical solution for handling spatial motions.

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

*Alexandre Chapin,Bruno Machado,Emmanuel Dellandréa,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates visual representation methods for robotic manipulation under distribution shifts and shows that Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR) outperform dense and global feature methods in generalization without task-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing visual representation methods for robotic manipulation, which struggle to generalize under distribution shifts such as lighting changes, textures, and distractors.

Method: The authors introduce Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into object-like entities, then benchmark this approach against global and dense representations across simulated and real-world tasks under diverse visual conditions.

Result: SBOCR-based policies demonstrated superior generalization compared to policies using dense and global representations, even without task-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: SBOCR is a promising approach for improving generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks, particularly in dynamic, visually diverse environments.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for solving challenges in 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling, enabling faster and more accurate integration of both sensors for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address difficulties in extrinsic calibration and annotation of sparse radar data for 4D radar and camera integration, which are essential for autonomous driving.

Method: The method involves a unique dual-purpose calibration target combining a checkerboard pattern for camera detection and a corner reflector for radar detection, alongside a robust correspondence algorithm. It also presents an auto-labeling pipeline using calibrated sensor relationships for annotation transfer.

Result: The proposed method achieves accurate calibration results and minimizes the manual annotation effort, enhancing radar-camera integration for autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates the development of multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving by advancing calibration and annotation methodologies.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework, which utilizes multi-dimensional tactile data from human demonstrations to enhance the contact-awareness of dexterous robots for tasks requiring intricate interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of low-dimensional tactile information in existing systems for dexterous manipulation, which can hinder their ability to generate comprehensive and effective tactile-aware motions.

Method: DexTac employs kinesthetic teaching to collect multi-dimensional tactile data, including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions, and integrates these tactile modalities into a policy network to train contact-aware agents for dexterous manipulation.

Result: The framework was evaluated on a unimanual injection task, achieving a 91.67% success rate. It also outperformed force-only baselines by 31.67% in high-precision scenarios, showcasing the benefits of integrating multi-dimensional tactile data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is crucial for robust and human-like dexterous manipulation, particularly in contact-intensive environments.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

*Anna Rothenhäusler,Markus Mazzola,Andreas Look,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Bödecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based method, MatchInformer, addresses the challenge of predicting hidden traffic agents for autonomous vehicles, improving prediction accuracy and reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor handling of occluded traffic agents by autonomous vehicles leads to unexpected hazards, and the need exists for more accurate and efficient predictions of such agents.

Method: MatchInformer combines Hungarian Matching into its training for one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, decouples heading from motion in trajectory forecasts, and uses Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for robust evaluation.

Result: Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, MatchInformer outperformed previous methods in predicting occluded regions and generating accurate trajectory forecasts.

Conclusion: Integrating innovative techniques such as Hungarian Matching and MCC evaluation leads to improved prediction performance for autonomous vehicle systems, making MatchInformer a significant advancement.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

### [276] [IROS: A Dual-Process Architecture for Real-Time VLM-Based Indoor Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21506)
*Joonhee Lee,Hyunseung Shin,Jeonggil Ko*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IROS is a real-time navigation framework for indoor mobile robots that combines efficient perception and contextual reasoning to achieve robust, human-like navigation with reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current indoor navigation methods fail to balance fast operation with robust semantic interpretation, especially when dealing with human-centric cues or reasoning about unseen areas.

Method: IROS employs a dual-process framework, separating quick reflexive actions from slower deliberative reasoning. It uses lightweight perceptual modules and a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM) that activates only when needed, leveraging spatial and textual cues.

Result: IROS improves decision accuracy while reducing latency by 66% over continuous VLM-based navigation in tests across five real-world buildings.

Conclusion: By integrating an efficient dual-process system and optimized VLM usage, IROS offers a practical solution for real-time indoor navigation, achieving a balance between speed and rich semantic understanding.

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

Conclusion: This work showcases that brain-inspired neuromorphic systems can handle dynamic interaction tasks and foster continuous learning, paving the way for optimized intelligent robotics.

Abstract: Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

Conclusion: AIR-VLA serves as a standard platform for advancing research in aerial manipulation systems, fostering innovation in general-purpose aerial robotics.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for sound-triggered mobile manipulation, enabling agents to autonomously interact with sound-emitting objects using a new dataset (Habitat-Echo) and a proposed baseline system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on mobile manipulation restricts autonomy as it relies on predefined textual instructions, limiting adaptability to dynamic environments.

Method: The authors introduce Habitat-Echo, a platform integrating acoustic rendering and physical interaction, and a baseline combining high-level task planning with low-level policy models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the baseline allows agents to detect auditory events and interact with sound-emitting objects autonomously. The agent is shown to isolate primary sound sources effectively, even in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances agent autonomy, enabling interaction with environments based on auditory triggers without explicit instructions, proving its robustness in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

Conclusion: The integration of CoFreeVLA improves safety and effectiveness in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts.

TL;DR: This paper explores a modular and efficient approach to reinforcement learning for robotic cloth manipulation, significantly reducing model size and training time while achieving superior performance on the SoftGym benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloth manipulation in robotics is challenging due to fabrics' high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and self-occlusion. Analytical methods have failed to provide robust manipulation policies, prompting the need for reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: The authors propose a modular RL method with careful design to reduce model size and training time, focusing on simulation training and sim-to-real transfer leveraging realistic workspace image inputs.

Result: The proposed method achieves better performance than baselines in the SoftGym benchmark tasks, all while using a much smaller model and reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Modular RL with thoughtful design choices can overcome major challenges in robotic cloth manipulation, offering an efficient and viable method for adoption in real-world robotics.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Result: The dataset includes synchronized eye-tracking measurements, environmental logs, and mental workload ratings suitable for algorithm development and temporal modeling.

Conclusion: GAZELOAD enables improved modeling of mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration by combining multimodal data and environmental factors.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve driving efficiency and safety in autonomous vehicles, especially in congested environments where existing frameworks struggle with mode transitions and control updates.

Method: Leveraging large language models (LLM) for scene understanding, combining that with mode configuration and motion planning using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization techniques.

Result: LAP, implemented in Python and ROS, outperformed existing benchmarks in terms of driving time and success rate in high-fidelity simulations.

Conclusion: The LAP method successfully reconciles efficient high-speed driving and precise maneuvering in dense traffic, showcasing the potential of LLMs in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, modular manipulation system using fabric-based surfaces, reducing actuator density while maintaining effective object control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, scalable manipulation system for fragile and heterogeneous objects, addressing limitations in dense actuator arrays that increase complexity and reduce scalability.

Method: The proposed system utilizes a modular design, geometric transformation-driven PID controller, and object-passing strategy for reduced actuator density, tested through simulations and physical prototypes.

Result: Successful manipulation of diverse objects, including fragile ones, validated via simulations and physical experiments, demonstrating scalability and effective performance.

Conclusion: The multi-module MANTA-RAY platform enables coordinated manipulation with improved scalability, showcasing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

*Jinhao Zhang,Wenlong Xia,Yaojia Wang,Zhexuan Zhou,Huizhe Li,Yichen Lai,Haoming Song,Youmin Gong,Jie Me*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses the issue of task-irrelevant noise in oversized denoising decoders for diffusion-based visuomotor policies. By introducing Variational Regularization (VR), a simpler and more efficient alternative, it achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the redundancy and noise caused by oversized denoising decoders in diffusion-based visuomotor policies, which hampers effective intermediate feature representation.

Method: The paper proposes Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian on backbone features and introduces a KL-divergence regularizer to control information flow.

Result: The proposed method improves success rates by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art results and showing promise in real-world robotic deployments.

Conclusion: Variational Regularization (VR) effectively mitigates task-irrelevant noise and enables diffusion-based learning approaches to achieve better performance. It simplifies the modeling process, demonstrating enhanced generalizability and deployability in both simulation and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for surgical robotics to improve learning and performance using limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in surgical robotics like data scarcity, constrained workspaces, safety, and predictability.

Method: Supervised Mixture-of-Experts architecture combined with an Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) for surgical tasks.

Result: Higher success rates, improved robustness, and zero-shot transfer to ex vivo tissue using stereo endoscopic images and fewer demonstrations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and generalizable framework for surgical robotics, showing potential for in vivo deployment.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a macro-scale foldable rotary motor leveraging origami design and corona discharge for torque production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foldable robots are desirable for their compactness, adaptability, and efficiency, yet current designs lack foldable rotary actuators.

Method: Development of an origami-based rotary motor using corona discharge for torque production, capable of folding flat and functioning upon unfurling.

Result: The motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, a top rotational speed of 1440 rpm at -29 kV, and a torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Conclusion: This prototype demonstrates a novel macro-scale rotary actuator design for foldable robotics, advancing compact and adaptable robotic locomotion.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PocketDP3 proposes a lightweight 3D diffusion policy for robotic manipulation, achieving efficient performance with significant model size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an architectural mismatch in current 3D vision-based diffusion policies: pairing compact point-cloud encoders with heavy decoders, leading to parameter inefficiency.

Method: PocketDP3 introduces the Diffusion Mixer (DiM), built on MLP-Mixer blocks, as a lightweight alternative to existing decoders. It supports effective temporal and channel dimension fusion for efficient computation.

Result: PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across simulation benchmarks with less than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also improving inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method optimizes model efficiency without compromising performance, enabling practical real-time deployment and demonstrating strong applicability in real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

*Runsheng Wang,Katelyn Lee,Xinyue Zhu,Lauren Winterbottom,Dawn M. Nilsen,Joel Stein,Matei Ciocarlie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The authors explore a method to adapt surface electromyography (sEMG)-based stroke intent detection using pretrained models on healthy individuals and fine-tuning for stroke patients, achieving improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting intent signals from paretic muscles for stroke rehabilitation using sEMG often requires lengthy calibration and is prone to variability.

Method: The approach initializes intent detection using healthy-pretrained sEMG models, then fine-tunes them with limited subject-specific stroke data using adaptation strategies like head-only tuning, LoRA adapters, and full fine-tuning.

Result: Adapted models showed enhanced stroke intent detection accuracy, with transition accuracy rising from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78 compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Healthy-domain pretraining and adaptation reduce calibration needs and improve robustness for real-time detection of stroke patient intent signals.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

TL;DR: DynamicVLA presents a novel framework tackling the challenges of dynamic object manipulation by leveraging temporal reasoning, efficient inference, and action streaming, evaluated with a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the existing limitations of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in dynamic object manipulation scenarios that require rapid decision-making and adaptability.

Method: DynamicVLA incorporates three innovations: a compact vision encoder for efficient inference, continuous inference for faster adaptation, and a temporal alignment mechanism for action execution.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated improved response speed, perception capabilities, and adaptability in dynamic scenarios using extensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynamicVLA advances capabilities for general dynamic object manipulation, bridging the perception-control gap and facilitating performance in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

*Bruno Claudino Matias,Savio Freire,Juliana Freitas,Felipe Fronchetti,Kostadin Damevski,Rodrigo Spinola*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on software maintainability and evolvability, highlighting benefits, risks, and mitigation tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of LLMs in software engineering is growing, but their mixed outcomes on long-term software maintainability and evolvability remain unclear.

Method: A systematic literature review of 87 studies (2020-2024) using databases like ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus, supported by human-guided LLM-based analysis.

Result: LLMs enhance code comprehension, debugging, testability, and automated repair while introducing risks like hallucinations, unstable performance, and limited domain reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs have both positive and negative impacts on software systems. Responsible use requires rigorous oversight and evaluation to ensure sustainability.

Abstract: Context. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability. Responsible adoption requires safeguards, rigorous evaluation, and structured human oversight.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces DevOps-Gym, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents in the complete DevOps workflow and highlights their existing limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI agents' effectiveness in the entire DevOps cycle, rather than just code generation, by addressing the need for benchmarks involving real-world DevOps tasks and tools.

Method: The authors developed DevOps-Gym, a benchmark with 700+ real-world tasks from 30+ Java and Go projects. It includes a semi-automated data collection mechanism for task quality and coverage.

Result: State-of-the-art AI models showed limitations in resolving issues, generating tests in Java and Go, and handling new tasks related to monitoring and build and configuration.

Conclusion: Current AI agents are insufficient for automating the full DevOps cycle, and further research is essential to improve AI capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: Even though demonstrating extraordinary capabilities in code generation and software issue resolving, AI agents' capabilities in the full software DevOps cycle are still unknown. Different from pure code generation, handling the DevOps cycle in real-world software, including developing, deploying, and managing, requires analyzing large-scale projects, understanding dynamic program behaviors, leveraging domain-specific tools, and making sequential decisions. However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated problems and lack environments and tool interfaces for DevOps. We introduce DevOps-Gym, the first end-to-end benchmark for evaluating AI agents across core DevOps workflows: build and configuration, monitoring, issue resolving, and test generation. DevOps-Gym includes 700+ real-world tasks collected from 30+ projects in Java and Go. We develop a semi-automated data collection mechanism with rigorous and non-trivial expert efforts in ensuring the task coverage and quality. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models and agents reveals fundamental limitations: they struggle with issue resolving and test generation in Java and Go, and remain unable to handle new tasks such as monitoring and build and configuration. These results highlight the need for essential research in automating the full DevOps cycle with AI agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing AI IDE agents' collaboration capabilities in complex, real-world software tasks effectively.

Method: A Dockerized test harness enabling structured interaction with an AI-native IDE-like environment; evaluation using 80 tasks from diverse, uncontaminated modern tech stack repositories.

Result: IDE-Bench demonstrates reliable correlation between AI agents' intended actions and success in modifying diverse codebases in various programming languages.

Conclusion: IDE-Bench provides a systematic and uncontaminated approach to measure AI IDE agents’ performance as collaborators in real-world developer environments.

Abstract: IDE-Bench is a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI IDE agents on real-world software engineering tasks through an IDE-native tool interface. We present a Dockerized test harness that goes beyond raw terminal execution, granting models a structured tool ecosystem that represents AI-native IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. By providing high-level abstractions for codebase search, structured file editing, and tools for testing full-stack applications, IDE-Bench evaluates an agent's ability to act as a true engineering collaborator. For evaluation and to prevent training data contamination, we created 80 tasks across eight never-published repositories spanning C/C++, Java, and MERN stacks, representing modern tech stack production scenarios, including feature implementation, bug fixing, refactoring, and performance optimization that mirror daily developer workflows in private codebases. Our benchmark is the first to systematically correlate agent-reported intent with successful project-level modifications in a multi-language, full-stack environment on completely uncontaminated code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how authors justify conducting additional SLRs on the same topic, using effort estimation in Agile software development as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLRs are effort-intensive, but the duplication of overlapping SLRs indicates researchers often don't check for existing reviews. This inefficiency can hinder progress in software engineering research.

Method: A qualitative content analysis was performed on 18 published SLRs related to Agile effort estimation. Factors like citation data, publication years, venues, and quality were analyzed alongside common justification patterns.

Result: Key justification patterns include identifying gaps, limitations in prior studies, outdated existing SLRs, and advancements that necessitate updates.

Conclusion: The paper suggests emphasizing existing SLR identification and justification in design guidelines, as well as policy improvements for conferences and journals to reduce duplication and enhance research progress.

Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and precision of the Domain-Driven Design process by automating the creation of metamodels, which are conventionally crafted manually by system designers, with the help of generative AI.

Method: The authors propose training a generative AI model on real-world DDD project data to generate domain-specific JSON objects. They use a 4-bit quantized Code Llama model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU.

Result: The fine-tuned AI model produced syntactically correct JSON objects with minimal post-processing, demonstrating its capability to assist the metamodel generation process despite hardware constraints.

Conclusion: The research validates the potential of generative AI in automating parts of the DDD process, showcasing improvements in efficiency, reducing hardware requirements, and setting the stage for advancements in AI-enabled software development.

Abstract: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a key framework for developing customer-oriented software, focusing on the precise modeling of an application's domain. Traditionally, metamodels that describe these domains are created manually by system designers, forming the basis for iterative software development. This paper explores the partial automation of metamodel generation using generative AI, particularly for producing domain-specific JSON objects. By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Despite limited hardware, the model achieved high performance, generating accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing. This research illustrates the viability of incorporating generative AI into the DDD process, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements, while also laying the groundwork for further advancements in AI-driven software development.

Result: 31% of studies fully address trustworthiness; six key studies explored blockchain's impact on reliability and accountability.

Conclusion: Blockchain benefits AI-driven SE via data integrity and transparency, but trust issues require reproducible frameworks and real-world testing for progress.

Abstract: Context: Blockchain and AI are increasingly explored to enhance trustworthiness in software engineering (SE), particularly in supporting software evolution tasks. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges. Future work must develop measurable, reproducible trust frameworks to enable reliable, secure, and compliant AI-driven SE ecosystems, including applications involving large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent definitions of research software hinder empirical studies and the evaluation of security risks in the research software supply chain.

Method: The authors conducted a targeted scoping review to harmonize definitions, synthesized them into a taxonomy, operationalized it on a dataset, and applied a security analysis using OpenSSF Scorecard.

Result: An RSSC-oriented taxonomy was established, along with an annotated dataset, labeling codebook, labeling pipeline, and insights into security signals based on taxonomy clusters.

Conclusion: Taxonomy-aware stratification is essential for interpreting research software supply chain security, aiding in standardizing empirical research and reducing risks.

Abstract: Empirical studies of research software are hard to compare because the literature operationalizes ``research software'' inconsistently. Motivated by the research software supply chain (RSSC) and its security risks, we introduce an RSSC-oriented taxonomy that makes scope and operational boundaries explicit for empirical research software security studies.
  We conduct a targeted scoping review of recent repository mining and dataset construction studies, extracting each work's definition, inclusion criteria, unit of analysis, and identification heuristics. We synthesize these into a harmonized taxonomy and a mapping that translates prior approaches into shared taxonomy dimensions. We operationalize the taxonomy on a large community-curated corpus from the Research Software Encyclopedia (RSE), producing an annotated dataset, a labeling codebook, and a reproducible labeling pipeline. Finally, we apply OpenSSF Scorecard as a preliminary security analysis to show how repository-centric security signals differ across taxonomy-defined clusters and why taxonomy-aware stratification is necessary for interpreting RSSC security measurements.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation approaches for language models in coding, identifies key problems, and introduces BEHELM—a benchmarking infrastructure to assess models holistically in software engineering contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks for language models in code, such as narrow tasks, lack of robustness, and data inconsistencies, which hinder the understanding and improvement of these models.

Method: The authors conducted a survey of existing benchmarks and gathered community insights through a workshop to identify barriers to reliable evaluations. They proposed BEHELM, a benchmarking infrastructure combining software scenario specifications with multi-metric evaluations.

Result: BEHELM provides a structured and standardized way to evaluate language models for coding tasks, addressing issues like diverse task coverage, language support, and quality assessment across multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: BEHELM aims to improve the evaluation framework for language models in software engineering, promoting fairer, scalable, and more realistic assessments while reducing the complexity of constructing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models for code are advancing fast, yet our ability to evaluate them lags behind. Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation. BEHELM provides a structured way to assess models across tasks, languages, input and output granularities, and key quality dimensions. Our goal is to reduce the overhead currently required to construct benchmarks while enabling a fair, realistic, and future-proof assessment of LLMs in software engineering.

*S M Mahedy Hasan,Md Fazle Rabbi,Minhaz Zibran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates the challenges and decision-making processes behind silent AI-generated pull requests (SPRs) by analyzing their impact on code quality and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the reasoning behind the acceptance or rejection of AI-generated pull requests, specifically those without accompanying comments or discussions, which makes their evaluation challenging.

Method: The paper conducts a quantitative analysis of 4,762 silent AI pull requests (SPRs) generated by five AI agents, focusing on their effects on code complexity, quality issues, and security vulnerabilities.

Result: The results provide insights into factors influencing the acceptance or rejection of SPRs by analyzing their impact on different code quality metrics.

Conclusion: Understanding the role of SPRs in code quality and their acceptance or rejection can enhance AI tools' development and improve automated contributions to repositories.

Abstract: We present the first empirical study of AI-generated pull requests that are 'silent,' meaning no comments or discussions accompany them. This absence of any comments or discussions associated with such silent AI pull requests (SPRs) poses a unique challenge in understanding the rationale for their acceptance or rejection. Hence, we quantitatively study 4,762 SPRs of five AI agents made to popular Python repositories drawn from the AIDev public dataset. We examine SPRs impact on code complexity, other quality issues, and security vulnerabilities, especially to determine whether these insights can hint at the rationale for acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

### [302] [AI-Assisted Engineering Should Track the Epistemic Status and Temporal Validity of Architectural Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116)
*Sankalp Gilda,Shlok Gilda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for explicit mechanisms to track the validity and status of architectural decisions in AI-assisted software engineering, proposing a framework to categorize, aggregate, and monitor evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inadequacy of current frameworks to distinguish evidence validity, prevent trust issues, and detect outdated evidence in rapidly-generated architectural decisions by AI coding assistants.

Method: The authors propose the First Principles Framework (FPF), which includes epistemic layers, conservative assurance aggregation using the Gödel t-norm, and automated evidence decay tracking.

Result: A retrospective audit of two internal projects using the proposed framework revealed 20-25% of decisions had outdated evidence within two months, demonstrating the importance of tracking evidence validity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed framework is necessary for maintaining accountability and reliability in AI-assisted software engineering, emphasizing future research potential in evidence handling and validation.

Abstract: This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.

### [303] [From Logic to Toolchains: An Empirical Study of Bugs in the TypeScript Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21186)
*TianYi Tang,Saba Alimadadi,Nick Sumner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates the types of bugs in TypeScript projects, finding that most issues are related to tooling, configuration, API misuse, and asynchronous handling rather than traditional logic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the adoption of TypeScript impacts software faults, given its rapid growth in modern web development.

Method: Analyzed 633 bug reports from 16 open-source TypeScript projects to create a taxonomy of fault types, their prevalence, and their correlation with project characteristics.

Result: Identified that tooling/configuration, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues dominate the fault types, correlating with build complexity and dependency diversity. Static typing reduces traditional errors but shifts fragility to toolchains.

Conclusion: TypeScript's language and ecosystem design influence fault profiles by reducing classic runtime errors but introducing new challenges in integration, build systems, and tooling.

Abstract: TypeScript has rapidly become a popular language for modern web development, yet its effect on software faults remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems.

*Roberto Milanese,Francesco Salzano,Angelica Spina,Antonio Vitale,Remo Pareschi,Fausto Fasano,Mattia Fazzini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper provides an empirical analysis of human-agent pull requests (HAPRs) versus human pull requests (HPRs), focusing on testing behaviors and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the role and impact of human-agent collaboration in software testing, which remains underexplored despite the rising integration of AI-based coding agents in development workflows.

Method: The authors analyzed 6,582 HAPRs and 3,122 HPRs from the AIDev dataset, examining testing frequency, testing types, and quality (using test smells).

Result: HAPRs showed a comparable likelihood of inclusion of tests (42.9% vs. 40%) but demonstrated greater test extent and were more likely to add new tests during co-evolution tasks. Differences in test smell categories had negligible impact on quality.

Conclusion: Human-agent collaboration influences testing practices by increasing test extent and introducing new tests in co-evolution tasks, without affecting overall test quality significantly.

Abstract: AI-based coding agents are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, collaborating with developers to create pull requests (PRs). Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality. These insights provide the first characterization of how human-agent collaboration shapes testing practices.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CovAgent, an AI-enhanced framework, significantly improves Android app UI testing coverage compared to prior techniques by overcoming limitations in reaching app activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI testing techniques for Android apps fail to achieve adequate activity coverage (often below 30%) due to the inability to generate complex inputs or meet activation conditions, harming app quality assurance.

Method: CovAgent employs AI agents to analyze decompiled Smali code and transition graphs, identify activation conditions blocking activity access, and dynamically generate instrumentation scripts to traverse unreachable code paths.

Result: Tests using CovAgent achieve significantly higher activity coverage compared to LLMDroid and other baselines like Fastbot and APE (e.g., improvements of 101.1%-179.7% in coverage). Additional metrics such as class, method, and line coverage are also improved.

Conclusion: By effectively enabling higher test coverage through agentic AI techniques, CovAgent demonstrates its potential to improve the quality and reliability of automated Android app testing.

Abstract: Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.

*Sayma Sultana,London Cavaletto,Bianca Trinkenreich,Amiangshu Bosu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates systemic biases faced by software engineers using Social Identity Theory and identifies significant impacts on career development and task selection biases, especially for women and marginalized ethnic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand systemic workplace biases in the specific context of software engineers, where its effects are under-researched compared to other non-computing fields.

Method: The study utilized a vignette-based survey to measure prevalence, demographics affected, outcomes, and motivations of biases among software engineers.

Result: Biases in career development and task selection are most frequent, disproportionately affecting women and marginalized ethnic groups. Other factors like age, experience, organization size, and location also predict bias victimization.

Conclusion: Gender, ethnicity, and additional socio-demographic factors are significant predictors of systemic workplace bias in software engineering, requiring targeted interventions to address these disparities.

Abstract: While systemic workplace bias is well-documented in non-computing fields, its specific impact on software engineers remains poorly understood. This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM Agents assist in tasks like code generation but may reduce long-term code quality and maintainability, leading to technical debt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the impacts of LLM-generated code pull requests on readability, maintainability, and overall development quality beyond pass rates.

Method: Analyzing the quality of LLM-generated pull requests using code metrics and emotions analysis from both an objective and subjective perspective.

Result: LLM-generated pull requests exhibit more code redundancy than human-made ones, though reviewers show neutral or positive emotions towards the AI contributions.

Conclusion: Despite positive reactions to AI contributions, their redundancy issues can silently accumulate technical debt, highlighting the need to improve human-AI collaboration in development.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are advancing quickly, with the increasing leveraging of LLM Agents to assist in development tasks such as code generation. While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments. Our research provides insights for improving human-AI collaboration.

### [308] [Detecting Multiple Semantic Concerns in Tangled Code Commits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21298)
*Beomsu Koh,Neil Walkinshaw,Donghwan Shin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the issue of tangled commits in version control systems, presenting a method to detect multiple concerns using small language models (SLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often create tangled commits that bundle multiple concerns, which complicates understanding and maintenance of code. The feasibility of using language models to detect these concerns was previously unexplored.

Method: The study frames multi-concern detection as a multi-label classification problem and creates an artificial dataset based on real-world data. It uses SLMs to study their performance under several conditions, such as fine-tuning and token-budget constraints.

Result: Fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLMs are competitive with state-of-the-art LLMs for single-concern detection and effective for up to three concerns. Including commit messages significantly improves detection accuracy without adding latency.

Conclusion: SLMs are a viable alternative to LLMs for detecting multiple concerns in tangled commits, with commit messages serving as valuable cues for improving detection accuracy.

Abstract: Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.

*Mark Looi,Julianne Quinn*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores the effects of Generative AI tools on software development, finding that frequent and broad usage strongly correlates with perceived gains in productivity and quality. Security concerns and testing tool adoption lag remain barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of Generative AI in software development raises questions about its perceptual impact and practical outcomes, prompting investigation into its effects on developer productivity and quality.

Method: The authors studied 147 professional developers, analyzing their usage patterns of AI tools, perceived outcomes, and readiness for AI-enhanced software development.

Result: Frequent and broad usage of AI tools strongly correlates with perceived productivity and quality. Security concerns moderately impact adoption, and testing tools lag behind coding tools, creating a Testing Gap.

Conclusion: High usage and broad applications drive adoption cycles among developers. Organizational transitions rely on Enthusiasts to convert Pragmatists, while Cautious developers remain static without examples of success. Policy marks maturity but does not drive intent to adopt AI tools.

Abstract: The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.

TL;DR: This paper conducts a large-scale study on developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions and introduces a prediction model, CSAP, which significantly improves the accuracy of predicting accepted suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative analysis in understanding and improving developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, which often cause interruptions in developer workflows.

Method: Analyzing 66,329 developer-AI interactions from a technology company to identify features associated with accepted and rejected code suggestions. Based on this analysis, the CSAP model is developed to predict suggestion acceptance.

Result: CSAP achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy (0.973 on imbalanced and 0.922 on balanced datasets) and outperforms both a large language model and an industrial filter with substantial accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: The model predicts acceptance of code suggestions effectively, demonstrating that targeted personalization can reduce interruptions, and provides a foundation for enhancing AI-assisted programming tools.

Abstract: AI-assisted programming tools are widely adopted, yet their practical utility is often undermined by undesired suggestions that interrupt developer workflows and cause frustration. While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\% and 69.5\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\% and 140.1\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming.

TL;DR: DebateCoder is a multi-agent collaborative framework to enhance reasoning in Small Language Models for code generation, showing improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs face reasoning bottlenecks and inefficiencies in managing complex logical requirements, urging the need for a scalable framework that elevates computational performance.

Method: A structured role-playing protocol (User Agent, Technical Agent, Quality Assurance Agent) alongside adaptive confidence gating, multi-turn deliberation, and analytical debugging loops are used to enhance SLMs’ collaborative reasoning.

Result: DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforms MapCoder, and reduces API overhead significantly (by 35%), proving its efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Collaborative protocols, as implemented in DebateCoder, can effectively mitigate SLM limitations, offering a resource-efficient solution to automated software engineering challenges.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed breakthroughs in automated code generation, Small Language Models (SLMs) often encounter reasoning bottlenecks and failure loops when addressing complex logical requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose DebateCoder, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to improve the reasoning ability of SLMs (e.g., Pangu-1B) in resource-constrained environments. DebateCoder uses a structured role-playing protocol with three agents: User Agent (A_UA), Technical Agent (A_TA), and Quality Assurance Agent (A_QA). It also includes an Adaptive Confidence Gating mechanism with a 95% threshold to balance accuracy and inference efficiency. In addition, we introduce a multi-turn deliberation module and a reviewer-guided analytical debugging loop for orthogonal pre-generation debate and post-generation refinement. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming MapCoder while reducing API overhead by about 35%. These results indicate that collaborative protocols can mitigate limitations of small-parameter models and provide a scalable, efficient approach to high-quality automated software engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of detecting input-dependent and intra-allocation out-of-bound memory accesses (OOB) in GPU programs. The authors propose SCuBA, a compile-time analysis tool that outperforms existing runtime techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory safety issues, like out-of-bound accesses, endanger the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. Current detection tools fail to identify input-dependent and intra-allocation OOBs, motivating the need for a better solution.

Method: SCuBA analyzes both CPU and GPU code, leveraging semantic relations between program variables. It uses a SAT solver to identify potential OOB access under any input and tracks memory partitioning to detect intra-allocation OOBs.

Result: SCuBA successfully detects elusive memory bugs, outperforming NVIDIA Compute Sanitizer by identifying all 45 missed bugs across 20 programs without false alarms.

Conclusion: SCuBA significantly enhances memory bug detection in GPU programs, offering a robust and reliable alternative to runtime detection techniques.

Abstract: Memory safety bugs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB) in GPU programs, can compromise the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.
  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective integer linear programming model and accompanying algorithms to reduce cognitive complexity in software by optimizing code structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the paper is to enhance software maintainability and reduce bugs and vulnerabilities by simplifying code comprehension.

Method: The authors use a multi-objective integer linear programming model to balance code complexity and line count, backed by algorithms and a validation tool.

Result: A computational tool was developed to apply various algorithms for optimizing code structure, addressing software cognitive complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed solution aims at improving software quality through parameterized resolution methods to simplify cognitive complexity effectively.

Abstract: Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces EthCRAFT, a tool for detecting context-aware RPC bugs in blockchain clients, outperforming existing detectors and finding new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of attention on generating proper blockchain contexts to detect context-dependent RPC bugs, which are often triggered under various conditions and lead to unexpected responses or vulnerabilities like Denial of Service.

Method: EthCRAFT works by exploring state transition programs of blockchain clients, generating transactions to construct contexts, designing context-aware RPC method call generation, and utilizing cross-referencing responses from different client implementations as detection oracles.

Result: EthCRAFT outperformed existing RPC detectors, identified six new RPC bugs in major Ethereum clients, and led to fixes; some earned bounty rewards from the Ethereum Foundation.

Conclusion: By generating and analyzing blockchain contexts, EthCRAFT improves the detection of context-dependent RPC bugs and strengthens the reliability and security of blockchain client implementations.

Abstract: Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.
  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation.

Conclusion: Mobile apps must address the unique needs of users across age groups. Insights gained from age-related reviews could help developers create more age-inclusive designs and improve usability.

Abstract: In recent years, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for managing various aspects of life. From enhancing productivity to providing personalized entertainment, mobile apps have revolutionized people's daily routines. Despite this rapid growth and popularity, gaps remain in how these apps address the needs of users from different age groups. Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to older users having difficulty with usability due to age-related vision and cognition impairments. Although there have been initiatives to create age-inclusive apps, a limited understanding of user perspectives on age-related issues may hinder developers from recognizing specific challenges and implementing effective solutions. In this study, we explore age discussions in app reviews to gain insights into how mobile apps should cater to users across different age groups.We manually curated a dataset of 4,163 app reviews from the Google Play Store and identified 1,429 age-related reviews and 2,734 non-age-related reviews. We employed eight machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to automatically detect age discussions, with RoBERTa performing the best, achieving a precision of 92.46%. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the 1,429 age-related reviews uncovers six dominant themes reflecting user concerns.

### [316] [AtPatch: Debugging Transformers via Hot-Fixing Over-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21695)
*Shihao Weng,Yang Feng,Jincheng Li,Yining Yin,Xiaofei Xie,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AtPatch, a dynamic method that mitigates backdoor attacks and unfairness in transformer-based DNNs by redistributing attention maps during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks and unfairness in transformer-based DNNs cause anomalous attention that over-focuses on triggers or protected attributes. Current mitigation strategies lack flexibility or distort feature representations, necessitating a new approach.

Method: AtPatch dynamically modifies attention maps during inference. It identifies anomalous columns with a pre-trained detector, replaces them with benign attention, rescales other columns, and returns the updated attention map while preserving original functionality.

Result: AtPatch outperformed existing methods in mitigating backdoor attacks and unfairness while retaining the model's original functionality based on extensive experimental validation.

Conclusion: AtPatch provides an effective and deployable solution for addressing over-attention issues in transformer-based DNNs without necessitating parameter modification or retraining.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) affected by backdoor attacks and unfairness typically exhibit anomalous attention patterns, leading to over-attend to backdoor triggers or protected attributes. Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modernizing legacy programming languages like FORTRAN 77, especially with proprietary extensions, is critical to maintain their relevance in industrial applications.

Method: The paper utilizes model-driven engineering techniques to transform proprietary Esope code into a readable and maintainable Fortran 2008 format.

Result: The approach supports readable and abstract migration results, aiding maintainability and scalability.

Conclusion: This tool offers a scalable and adaptable solution for modernizing legacy languages while ensuring quality in migrated code.

Abstract: Legacy programming languages such as FORTRAN 77 still play a vital role in many industrial applications. Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.

TL;DR: The paper examines the strain on peer review in software engineering due to increased submission volume and proposes solutions to improve scalability and resilience of the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing disparity between high paper submissions and availability of qualified reviewers threatens the growth and quality of software engineering research.

Method: The vision suggests focusing on three key strategies: training newcomers, incentivizing community participation, and integrating AI tools to enhance peer review.

Result: The suggested vision addresses the problem by aiming for a robust, inclusive, and sustainable peer review process.

Conclusion: Adopting scalable and innovative review practices is essential to ensure the growth and quality of software engineering research.

Abstract: Peer review is the main mechanism by which the software engineering community assesses the quality of scientific results. However, the rapid growth of paper submissions in software engineering venues has outpaced the availability of qualified reviewers, creating a growing imbalance that risks constraining and negatively impacting the long-term growth of the Software Engineering (SE) research community. Our vision of the Future of the SE research landscape involves a more scalable, inclusive, and resilient peer review process that incorporates additional mechanisms for: 1) attracting and training newcomers to serve as high-quality reviewers, 2) incentivizing more community members to serve as peer reviewers, and 3) cautiously integrating AI tools to support a high-quality review process.

### [319] [Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21787)
*Chantale Lauer,Peter Pfeiffer,Alexander Rombach,Nijat Mehdiyev*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEF4LLM, a framework to systematically evaluate BPMN models generated by LLMs, and compares their quality to human-generated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of creating BPMN models combined with existing limitations in evaluating the quality of LLM-generated models led to the need for a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: The authors developed the BEF4LLM evaluation framework with four quality perspectives (syntactic, pragmatic, semantic, and validity), benchmarking open-source LLMs against human modelers.

Result: LLMs perform well in syntactic and pragmatic quality but are less accurate in semantic quality and validity compared to human modelers.

Conclusion: LLMs show competitive potential in BPMN modeling, but improvements in validity and semantic understanding are needed for their practical deployment.

Abstract: The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores and defines folklore in software engineering, identifying its narratives, myths, and informal knowledge through qualitative research and interviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the informal, cultural, and narrative aspects within software development communities that influence knowledge and practices.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review, thematic analysis, and semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden.

Result: The paper identified key folklore items like myths about software practices and analyzed them in context, leading to a definition of software engineering folklore.

Conclusion: Explicitly understanding software engineering folklore enables further ethnography, reflective practices, and helps balance helpful heuristics with challenging unhelpful folklore.

Abstract: We explore the concept of folklore within software engineering, drawing from folklore studies to define and characterize narratives, myths, rituals, humor, and informal knowledge that circulate within software development communities. Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Replay, a technique for cost-efficient and effective test-time scaling of LLM agents in software engineering, reusing prior trajectories instead of starting from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense and limitations of traditional test-time scaling methods for LLM agents in SWE tasks, which rely on repeated sampling or noisy value estimates.

Method: Proposed SWE-Replay, a method that optimizes test-time scaling by reusing prior trajectories and branching at critical steps based on repository exploration significance, avoiding dependence on LLM-based quality estimates.

Result: SWE-Replay reduces computational costs by up to 17.4% on SWE-Bench Verified while maintaining or improving performance by up to 3.8%. It shows generalizability and robustness across other benchmarks like SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual.

Conclusion: SWE-Replay is an efficient and generalizable strategy for test-time scaling of LLM agents in SWE tasks, offering both cost savings and performance improvements while avoiding reliance on potentially error-prone external quality evaluations.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

### [322] [Differential Dynamic Causal Nets: Model Construction, Identification and Group Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21478)
*Kang You,Gary Green,Jian Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to construct hierarchical differential causal networks for comparing brain systems using EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in pathophysiological modeling is the difficulty in modeling neuron interactions across microscale and macroscale measurement levels, especially during group comparisons.

Method: The method involves constructing causal networks where nodes are parameterized local neural systems, and edges represent connections with transmission parameters. It uses mixed-effects models and an evolutionary optimization algorithm for parameter inference.

Result: The model shows disruptions in networks and altered connectivity during epileptic seizures in both synthetic and real EEG data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tracks dynamic neural causality and identifies brain system functional alterations during seizures, advancing EEG-based modeling.

Abstract: Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.

*Johannes Bertram,Luciano Dyballa,Anderson Keller,Savik Kinger,Steven W. Zucker*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the internal workings of a neural foundation model to understand its alignment with biological visual systems and explores representational structures of different modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the biological plausibility of foundation models in fitting neural activity and to explore design changes that can better align these models with brain function.

Method: The authors employed a novel analysis of neurons' temporal response properties using decoding and encoding manifolds. They characterized representational structures across different processing stages (encoder, recurrent, readout) of the neural activity model.

Result: The study found that the recurrent module significantly enhances representation by separating temporal stimulus patterns, while the readout module uses less biologically plausible specialized feature maps. It also introduced a 'tubularity' metric to measure biological relevance.

Conclusion: The findings suggest improvements to bring neural foundation models closer to biological validity, such as adding recurrence in early stages and constraining feature use in the readout module.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module.

*Youguang Chen,George Biros*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent-IMH, a new method for faster sampling in Bayesian linear inverse problems, leveraging an approximate operator for offline computation and achieving superior efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges in sampling posterior distributions for Bayesian linear inverse problems, particularly when the operator $A$ is expensive to compute.

Method: The authors propose Latent-IMH, which uses an inexpensive approximation $\tilde{A}$ to generate latent variables before refining them with the exact $A$, built on the Metropolis-Hastings independence sampler framework.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that Latent-IMH, under reasonable conditions, is significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art methods like NUTS, in some cases by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Latent-IMH is an effective sampling approach for Bayesian inverse problems, successfully reducing online computational costs and providing theoretical guarantees on performance.

Abstract: We study sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian linear inverse problems where $A$, the parameters to observables operator, is computationally expensive. In many applications, $A$ can be factored in a manner that facilitates the construction of a cost-effective approximation $\tilde{A}$. In this framework, we introduce Latent-IMH, a sampling method based on the Metropolis-Hastings independence (IMH) sampler. Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency. In some cases, Latent-IMH can be orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with super-exponential search space growth and computational demands in causal structure learning from observational data.

Method: VISTA employs a modular approach using Markov Blankets, weighted voting for edge integration, a Feedback Arc Set algorithm for acyclicity, and adaptive thresholds to filter unreliable edges.

Result: Experiments show VISTA improves accuracy and efficiency across diverse settings, with established theoretical guarantees such as finite-sample error bounds and asymptotic consistency.

Conclusion: VISTA provides a robust, scalable, model-agnostic solution for causal structure learning, addressing current limitations and enhancing computational efficacy.

Abstract: Learning causal structures from observational data remains a fundamental yet computationally intensive task, particularly in high-dimensional settings where existing methods face challenges such as the super-exponential growth of the search space and increasing computational demands. To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.

*Louis Grenioux,RuiKang OuYang,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF), a method to improve energy-based models (EBMs) by reframing EBM learning as a classification task to enable higher fidelity and broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While score-based generative models show strong performance, training energy-based models (alternative representation using input-gradients of energy functions) is challenging due to computational inefficiency and mode blindness in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose DiffCLF, which reformulates EBM training as a supervised classification problem across noise levels. It combines this with existing score-based objectives to address computational and mode blindness challenges.

Result: The proposed DiffCLF method outperforms existing approaches in tasks like model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling, as validated on analytical Gaussian mixtures and other test cases.

Conclusion: DiffCLF enhances the training of EBMs, providing better energy estimations and extending their applicability for practical tasks like compositional sampling and Boltzmann Generator modeling.

Abstract: Score-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable success. While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling. Our results show that DiffCLF enables EBMs with higher fidelity and broader applicability than existing approaches.

### [327] [Diffusion-based Annealed Boltzmann Generators : benefits, pitfalls and hopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21026)
*Louis Grenioux,Maxence Noble*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of Boltzmann Generators that use annealed Monte Carlo techniques with diffusion models to sample from complex multi-modal and high-dimensional distributions, addressing key limitations such as inaccurate density estimation and performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical physics requires efficient sampling methods for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, especially for multi-modal, high-dimensional targets where current approaches like Boltzmann Generators face limitations.

Method: The paper investigates using annealed Monte Carlo Boltzmann Generators (aMC-BGs) with diffusion models as backbones. It evaluates their performance on controlled experiments (Gaussian mixtures) under two settings: perfectly learned diffusion models and diffusion models trained from data. Additionally, it examines different integration mechanisms like second-order denoising kernels and deterministic transport maps.

Result: Second-order denoising kernels perform better than first-order ones when covariance information is available. Deterministic transport maps outperform stochastic ones but at a higher computational cost. Inaccurate diffusion model log-density estimation emerges as the major bottleneck in the learned model setting.

Conclusion: While DM-based aMC-BGs show potential, significant challenges such as log-density estimation errors limit their accuracy. Improvements in density estimation and recalibration methods are necessary for practical applications.

Abstract: Sampling configurations at thermodynamic equilibrium is a central challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost. Finally, in the learned-DM setting, all DM-aMC variants struggle to produce accurate BGs; we trace the main bottleneck to inaccurate DM log-density estimation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine that efficiently estimates the probability of system failures using adaptive sampling while minimizing model evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a machine learning method to accurately determine the probability of failure in complex systems while reducing the computational cost associated with evaluating system models multiple times.

Method: The method combines a Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine with Gabriel edited sets, creating an adaptive sampling strategy near decision boundaries and utilizing strategic clustering to build locally linear surrogate boundaries.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art classification methods on four test problems and is successfully applied to the Lotka--Volterra survival probability model.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that the method effectively minimizes computational effort while preserving accuracy in estimating failure probabilities, making it suitable for complex systems analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method called the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine based on the Gabriel edited set for the computation of the probability of failure for a complex system as determined by a threshold condition on a computer model of system behavior. The method is designed to minimize the number of evaluations of the computer model while preserving the geometry of the decision boundary that determines the probability. It employs an adaptive sampling strategy designed to strategically allocate points near the boundary determining failure and builds a locally linear surrogate boundary that remains consistent with its geometry by strategic clustering of training points. We prove two convergence results and we compare the performance of the method against a number of state of the art classification methods on four test problems. We also apply the method to determine the probability of survival using the Lotka--Volterra model for competing species.

*Zhou Fan,Leda Wang*

TL;DR: The paper characterizes how mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) evolves dynamics in high-dimensional models under specific scaling conditions, introducing dynamical mean-field equations as an exact description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the dynamics of SGD in high-dimensional environments and provide rigorous mathematical characterization for different scaling parameters like batch size, learning rate, etc.

Method: The authors employed asymptotic analysis in high dimensions where both sample size and data dimension scale proportionally, deriving dynamical mean-field equations and Gaussian diffusion approximations.

Result: The study concludes that the dynamics of SGD remains invariant across batch size scaling parameters under specific conditions. However, SGD, SME, and gradient flow exhibit different dynamics, except for linear models where SGD and SME align.

Conclusion: The research provides deep insights into the behavior of SGD under multi-pass, mini-batch setups and emphasizes that dynamics depend heavily on scaling factors, offering tools for precise understanding.

Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $κ\asymp n^α$ where $α\in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $α\in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.

Motivation: The motivation is to address biased estimations in existing training-free guidance methods of diffusion models, which fail to capture inherent multimodal distributions in the reverse diffusion process.

Method: The authors propose a sequential Monte Carlo framework with variance-reduction schemes like Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to integrate over denoising distribution via Monte Carlo approximation.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (95.6%) on CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation with 3× lower cost-per-success compared to baselines and 1.5× cost-per-success advantage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The framework provides accurate and computationally efficient guidance for training-free conditional generation in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate, training-free guidance for conditional generation in trained diffusion models. Existing methods typically rely on point-estimates to approximate the posterior score, often resulting in biased approximations that fail to capture multimodality inherent to the reverse process of diffusion models. We propose a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework that constructs an unbiased estimator of $p_θ(y|x_t)$ by integrating over the full denoising distribution via Monte Carlo approximation. To ensure computational tractability, we incorporate variance-reduction schemes based on Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC). Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for training-free guidance on CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, achieving $95.6\%$ accuracy with $3\times$ lower cost-per-success than baselines. On ImageNet, our algorithm achieves $1.5\times$ cost-per-success advantage over existing methods.

### [331] [Provably Reliable Classifier Guidance through Cross-entropy Error Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21200)
*Sharan Sahu,Arisina Banerjee,Yuchen Wu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of classifier training in guided diffusion models and provides a theoretical basis for classifier guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear relationship between standard classifier training procedures and their effectiveness in guiding diffusion models.

Method: The authors show that controlling the cross-entropy error during diffusion steps leads to effective guidance vectors, supported by smoothness assumptions and counterexamples for non-smooth classifiers.

Result: The study establishes an upper bound on sampling error under classifier guidance and identifies the necessity of smooth classifiers for effective guidance.

Conclusion: A quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment is established, providing theoretical insights and guiding the selection of classifiers for diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of a learned classifier, yet it remains unclear whether standard classifier training procedures yield effective diffusion guidance. We address this gap by showing that, under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifiers, controlling the cross-entropy error at each diffusion step also controls the error of the resulting guidance vectors: classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ from the ground-truth conditional label probabilities induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde{O}(d \varepsilon )$. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error under classifier guidance and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev-type inequality. Moreover, we show that the classifier smoothness assumption is essential, by constructing simple counterexamples demonstrating that, without it, control of the guidance vector can fail for almost all distributions. To our knowledge, our work establishes the first quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment, yielding both a theoretical foundation for classifier guidance and principled guidelines for classifier selection.

### [332] [A Flexible Empirical Bayes Approach to Generalized Linear Models, with Applications to Sparse Logistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21217)
*Dongyue Xie,Wanrong Zhu,Matthew Stephens*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new flexible empirical Bayes approach for Bayesian generalized linear models is introduced, featuring a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method that optimizes prior and posterior mean parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified, tuning-free Bayesian framework for generalized linear models, addressing limitations of existing VI methods and reducing optimization complexity.

Method: A novel VI method that directly optimizes posterior mean and prior parameters using scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent.

Result: The method achieves superior predictive performance in sparse logistic regression when compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This unified framework simplifies VI development across various exponential family distributions and enhances predictive accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a flexible empirical Bayes approach for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models. Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free. Unlike traditional VI methods that optimize the posterior density function, our approach directly optimizes the posterior mean and prior parameters. This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches.

### [333] [Bulk-Calibrated Credal Ambiguity Sets: Fast, Tractable Decision Making under Out-of-Sample Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21324)
*Mengqi Chen,Thomas B. Berrett,Theodoros Damoulas,Michele Caprio*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach to solve challenges in distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) under minimal assumptions by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets, providing a robust objective and efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) where classical models like Huber contamination can lead to vacuous objectives due to unbounded risks under minimal-assumption settings.

Method: The authors propose using bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets that focus on learning a high-mass bulk set while addressing contaminations inside the bulk and bounding tail contributions separately. This approach is linked to imprecise probability (IP) theory for robust objectives.

Result: The proposed framework yields a robust and interpretable objective with efficient linear or second-order cone programs for common loss functions, achieving competitive accuracy-robustness trade-offs in various experiments.

Conclusion: This method effectively handles DRO under minimal assumptions, demonstrating improved robustness and efficiency in practical settings, including tasks with distributional shifts in data.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) minimises the worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set that can capture distributional shifts in out-of-sample environments. While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\mathrm{mean}+\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels. Experiments on heavy-tailed inventory control, geographically shifted house-price regression, and demographically shifted text classification show competitive robustness-accuracy trade-offs and efficient optimisation times, using Bayesian, frequentist, or empirical reference distributions.

*Erica Zhang,Naomi Sagan,Danny Tse,Fangzhao Zhang,Mert Pilanci,Jose Blanchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Statsformer, a framework for integrating LLM-derived knowledge into supervised learning, addressing limitations of previous methods by using an adaptive guardrailed ensemble system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of integrating LLM-derived priors into supervised learning, including issues with sensitivity to hallucinations and inflexible methods tied to specific learners.

Method: The authors propose a guardrailed ensemble architecture embedding LLM-derived priors in a system of linear and non-linear learners, optimally calibrated via cross-validation to ensure robustness and adaptability.

Result: Statsformer demonstrates consistent performance improvements using informative priors, while reducing the impact of hallucinations or uninformative guidance across various prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively incorporates LLM knowledge into supervised learning, ensuring adaptability, statistical guarantees, and robustness against unreliable LLM guidance.

Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.

*Yizhou Min,Yizhou Lu,Lanqi Li,Zhen Zhang,Jiaye Teng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how the traditional evaluation metrics for conformal prediction may be misleading due to techniques like the Prejudicial Trick (PT). It proposes a new metric for detecting such biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction is evaluated based on coverage and interval length, but the interval length can be deceptively improved using biased methods like PT, raising practical concerns.

Method: The paper formally derives conditions for misleading improvements due to PT, conducts empirical tests across regression and classification tasks, and introduces the metric interval stability.

Result: PT can produce deceptively lower interval lengths while preserving coverage, but it introduces vulnerabilities such as unstable intervals across repeated runs.

Conclusion: Interval stability is introduced as a new metric to assess conformal prediction methods and detect implicit biases like those introduced by PT.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has become a cornerstone of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, conventionally evaluated by its coverage and interval length. This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques.

*Francisco Caldas,Sahil Kumar,Cláudia Soares*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that better preserves patterns like seasonality by leveraging spectral decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance time-series forecasting by addressing the limitations of standard diffusion processes in preserving structured temporal patterns, such as seasonality.

Method: The method introduces a model-agnostic forward diffusion process that stages noise injection based on spectral component energy, preserving dominant frequencies using strategies like Fourier or Wavelet transforms.

Result: The proposed spectral decomposition approach improves the forecast quality compared to traditional diffusion processes with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Incorporating spectral decomposition into the forward diffusion process significantly enhances forecasting performance for diffusion models without modifying network architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

*Mingyuan Xu,Xinzi Tan,Jiawei Wu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the reliability issues in LLM evaluation using judge models, proposing a framework to better account for judge inconsistency while generating rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in open-ended tasks are evaluated by judge LLMs, but inconsistencies among judges can lead to biased rankings and unreliable conclusions, necessitating a solution.

Method: A judge-aware ranking framework is introduced based on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, incorporating judge-specific reliability and using pairwise comparison data to evaluate both LLM quality and judge performance.

Result: The proposed method aligns better with human preferences, increases data efficiency, and offers better uncertainty quantification in LLM rankings compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: By modeling judge-specific differences, this framework improves the reliability and interpretability of LLM evaluation results, enabling more trustworthy rankings and insights.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes using latent subspaces in exponential parameter spaces for efficient generative modeling of discrete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for a more efficient representation of discrete data by encoding statistical dependencies and eliminating redundancies in categorial variables.

Method: They use latent subspaces and a Riemannian geometry-based framework where geodesics become straight lines, ensuring isometries and enabling effective flow matching during model training.

Result: Empirical results show that low-dimensional latent spaces are sufficient for effective generative modeling of discrete data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces data complexity, enabling streamlined generative modeling through latent subspaces and Riemannian geometry.

Abstract: We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental issue of stability and long-time behavior in generative models, which is crucial for ensuring their reliability.

Method: The authors use a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition to derive stability bounds in reverse diffusion dynamics.

Result: The findings reveal that reverse diffusion dynamics induce a contraction mechanism, ensuring quantitative stability in the sampling process.

Conclusion: The study provides a structured framework to analyze error propagation in score-based generative models, offering insights into stochastic dynamics' role in ensuring model stability.

Abstract: Understanding the stability and long-time behavior of generative models is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning. This paper provides quantitative bounds on the sampling error of score-based generative models by leveraging stability and forgetting properties of the Markov chain associated with the reverse-time dynamics. Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches.

*Lev Fedorov,Michaël E. Sander,Romuald Elie,Pierre Marion,Mathieu Laurière*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes deep Transformers under stochastic initialization, revealing how token dynamics differ significantly from deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the token dynamics in deep Transformers is challenging, as existing deterministic theories fail to align with standard initialization schemes. This paper investigates how stochastic effects influence token behavior.

Method: The authors study Transformer dynamics using diffusion scaling, token-wise RMS normalization, and matrix-valued Brownian noise arising from random initialization of value matrices. They prove convergence to an interacting-particle system for infinite layers.

Result: They show that initialization noise prevents token collapse into a single cluster predicted by deterministic models and induces phase transitions, revealing configurations like antipodal formations.

Conclusion: Intrinsic stochasticity in Transformer initialization plays a critical role in preventing token collapse, enabling more diverse token dynamics and improving performance compared to deterministic approaches.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new diffusion-based sampler for probabilistic target distributions, enhancing accuracy using Langevin Monte Carlo methods and control-variate schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sampling for target distributions when a normalizing constant is unavailable, leveraging diffusion models and score estimation for better accuracy and theoretical guarantees.

Method: Utilizes a diffusion-based sampling framework with annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo for score estimation, and optimized control variate schedules to reduce variance.

Result: Demonstrated theoretical guarantees and empirical success of the method on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance sampling and provide variance minimization techniques for practical probabilistic modeling tasks.

Abstract: We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: A near-optimal testing procedure with Gaussian differential privacy for various tests is proposed, achieving high relative efficiency and improving upon existing DP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a private testing procedure that matches efficiency and accuracy of non-private methods while adhering to privacy constraints.

Method: Utilized a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, constructing private test statistics with controlled type I error.

Result: Private tests matched the asymptotic efficiency of non-private tests, outperforming existing DP methods in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed procedure successfully balances privacy and statistical performance, making it feasible for practical use under privacy constraints.

Abstract: We develop a near-optimal testing procedure under the framework of Gaussian differential privacy for simple as well as one- and two-sided tests under monotone likelihood ratio conditions. Our mechanism is based on a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, whose population risk matches the private minimax rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational inefficiencies of existing stochastic approximation methods in optimizing functions with intractable gradients, such as in maximum marginal likelihood and generative models.

Method: The work introduces an SMC-based approach to replace expensive inner sampling methods, offering efficient SMC approximations for optimization.

Result: The proposed approach is shown to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining effectiveness, with convergence results established for its methodology.

Conclusion: SMC samplers provide an efficient alternative to traditional inner sampling methods for intractable gradient problems, as demonstrated in the tuning of energy-based models.

Abstract: The problem of optimising functions with intractable gradients frequently arise in machine learning and statistics, ranging from maximum marginal likelihood estimation procedures to fine-tuning of generative models. Stochastic approximation methods for this class of problems typically require inner sampling loops to obtain (biased) stochastic gradient estimates, which rapidly becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we develop sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers for optimisation of functions with intractable gradients. Our approach replaces expensive inner sampling methods with efficient SMC approximations, which can result in significant computational gains. We establish convergence results for the basic recursions defined by our methodology which SMC samplers approximate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the reward-tuning of energy-based models within various settings.

*Qiyang Han*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates the arm-pull dynamics in Thompson-sampling type algorithms, highlighting their different stability properties and proposing tools for improved inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the divergence of arm-pull stability dynamics in Thompson-sampling algorithms from UCB-type algorithms, and to unify principles governing stability and inference challenges.

Method: The authors use mathematical tools such as Stieltjes integral analysis and SDE-reparametrization, leveraging the Hörmander condition and Stroock-Varadhan theorem to study arm-pull dynamics and invariant laws.

Result: A dichotomy in arm-pull dynamics is identified: stable arms exhibit asymptotic determinism while unstable arms converge to a unique invariant law. Normalized arm means correspondingly demonstrate Gaussian limits for stable arms and non-Gaussian limits for unstable ones.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into stability in Thompson-sampling algorithms, enabling tractable inference across regimes and advancing the theoretical understanding behind adaptive sampling dynamics.

Abstract: Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.
  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.
  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.
  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic Hörmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven decentralized framework for improving multi-agent environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional mapping deteriorates with uncertain priors, necessitating adaptive frameworks for robust performance in decentralized multi-agent systems.

Method: An adaptive AI-driven mechanism using optimal transport and dual MLP modules enhances density estimation and mitigates stagnation, supported by convergence proofs.

Result: Simulation results highlight higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex spatial distributions compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves decentralized mapping by ensuring scalability, consistency, and robustness in varying environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-augmented decentralized framework for multi-agent (multi-robot) environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication. While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of sample complexity in covariance estimation from log-concave distributions, especially comparing single-chain and parallelized methods.

Method: The authors analyzed and derived sample complexity guarantees using ULA, incorporating log-Sobolev inequality to establish concentration bounds on the sample covariance matrix.

Result: Single-chain ULA demonstrates better sample complexity, outperforming parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor due to reduced bias from burn-in.

Conclusion: Single-chain ULA is more efficient than parallel ULA for this problem, owing to better bias reduction mechanisms.

Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of strongly log-concave smooth distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.

*Simon Woodruff*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper reviews work done for ARPA-E on fusion power-plant costing from 2017 to 2024. It outlines how the costing methods evolved from scaling-based estimates to a more detailed, standards-compliant approach, including open-source tools for transparent costing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve methodologies for evaluating and estimating the costs of fusion power plants, considering engineering realities and incorporating advanced analysis tools for better decision-making in the development of fusion energy systems.

Method: Early work relied on ARIES-style cost scaling and collaboration with industry experts like Bechtel. Later, it adopted nuclear-related cost methodologies, modular and learning-based cost-reduction techniques, and fully transitioned to standards-based, subsystem-specific models in 2023, culminating in an open-source Python platform (pyFECONs).

Result: The framework transitioned from simple cost-scaling to detailed, standardized, subsystem-informed modeling. Key tools like pyFECONs now enable consistent and transparent cost analysis.

Conclusion: The research developed a robust, adaptable methodology for fusion power-plant costing that integrates industry standards, advances in modularization, and open-source tools to facilitate transparent decision-making for fusion energy projects.

Abstract: This paper summarizes and consolidates fusion power-plant costing work performed in support of ARPA-E from 2017 through 2024, and documents the evolution of the associated analysis framework from early capital-cost-focused studies to a standards-aligned, auditable costing capability. Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE.

### [348] [Blind Ultrasound Image Enhancement via Self-Supervised Physics-Guided Degradation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21856)
*Shujaat Khan,Syed Muhammad Atif,Jaeyoung Huh,Syed Saad Azhar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework for ultrasound (US) images, addressing issues like speckle noise and scanner artifacts, using a physics-guided degradation model and Swin Convolutional U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of ultrasound image interpretation by overcoming common degradation issues such as speckle noise, acquisition blur, and scanner/operator-specific artifacts.

Method: The method uses a physics-guided degradation model with Swin Convolutional U-Net for blind deconvolution and denoising. It synthesizes inputs using Gaussian PSF surrogates and noise injection through additive Gaussian noise or Fourier-domain perturbations.

Result: The framework achieves superior PSNR/SSIM across noise levels, enhances resolution without edge erosion, and improves segmentation accuracy when used as a preprocessor.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances US images in a robust and generalizable manner across datasets, scanners, and degradation types, showing promise as a practical tool for medical imaging enhancement.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) interpretation is hampered by multiplicative speckle, acquisition blur from the point-spread function (PSF), and scanner- and operator-dependent artifacts. Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\sim$1--4\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\sim$2--5\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle. Controlled PSF studies show reduced FWHM and higher peak gradients, evidence of resolution recovery without edge erosion. Used as a plug-and-play preprocessor, it consistently boosts Dice for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation. Overall, the approach offers a practical, assumption-light path to robust US enhancement that generalizes across datasets, scanners, and degradation types.

### [349] [Pathwise Learning of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21860)
*Nicole Tianjiao Yang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural path estimation approach using variational inference to model stochastic dynamical systems from noisy, non-linear observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reconstructing and inferring stochastic dynamical systems from noisy, indirectly observed data, which is critical in many practical scenarios but difficult to achieve with standard approaches.

Method: The paper formulates a stochastic control problem to solve the filtering posterior path measure using a Zakai equation and constructs a generative model that maps prior to posterior path measures through controlled diffusion. The approach leverages variational inference and learns control via embedding of noisy observational paths.

Result: The introduced model effectively reconstructs and infers multimodal, chaotic, or high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems from indirect data through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed neural path estimation framework successfully learns system dynamics and probabilistic measures under noisy observational conditions, showcasing its utility in complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.

### [350] [On Approximate Computation of Critical Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21917)
*Amir Ali Ahmadi,Georgina Hall*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the intractability of approximating critical points in simple nonconvex functions, challenging the belief that such computations are generally tractable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that approximate computation of critical points in nonconvex optimization is computationally manageable.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework and prove that approximating critical points of low-degree nonconvex polynomials is NP-hard, even under structural and bounded settings.

Result: Proves that approximating critical points in low-degree nonconvex functions is computationally hard under various scenarios, relating it to P vs NP difficulties.

Conclusion: The study underscores the computational intractability of this task and contrasts it sharply with the widely held belief of its tractability.

Abstract: We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance mobile financial security by addressing vulnerabilities exploited by FjordPhantom malware, which threatens banking app users.

Method: Researchers conducted empirical analysis on the susceptibility of local banking apps to FjordPhantom and evaluated existing protective measures, while exploring improvements.

Result: The study highlights gaps in current defenses against FjordPhantom and proposes methods to detect and mitigate the malware's exploitation tactics.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights to improve security in banking apps by addressing vulnerabilities targeted by FjordPhantom malware.

Abstract: Android banking applications have revolutionized financial management by allowing users to perform various financial activities through mobile devices. However, this convenience has attracted cybercriminals who exploit security vulnerabilities to access sensitive financial data. FjordPhantom, a malware identified by our industry collaborator, uses virtualization and hooking to bypass the detection of malicious accessibility services, allowing it to conduct keylogging, screen scraping, and unauthorized data access. This malware primarily affects banking and finance apps across East and Southeast Asia region where our industry partner's clients are primarily based in. It requires users to be deceived into installing a secondary malicious component and activating a malicious accessibility service. In our study, we conducted an empirical study on the susceptibility of banking apps in the region to FjordPhantom, analyzed the effectiveness of protective measures currently implemented in those apps, and discussed ways to detect and prevent such attacks by identifying and mitigating the vulnerabilities exploited by this malware.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiencies of traditional multiple imputation methods in handling massive datasets and introduces a scalable solution using bigMICE, built on Apache Spark, for memory-efficient and accurate imputations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of handling missing data in large datasets results in biased analyses and traditional imputation methods like MICE struggle due to computational and memory constraints.

Method: The authors developed bigMICE leveraging Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML to adapt the MICE framework for big data, ensuring controlled memory usage even on hardware like ordinary laptops.

Result: Tests on a Swedish medical registry showed enhanced memory efficiency, faster runtime, and high-quality imputations even for data with large missing proportions.

Conclusion: bigMICE provides a scalable and efficient solution for imputation in large datasets, facilitating high-quality analysis and offering open-source accessibility with usage guidance.

Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations.
  To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops.
  The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.

*Augusto Fasano,Giovanni Rebaudo*

TL;DR: The paper presents a mean-field variational Bayes method for Bayesian variable selection under a probit link, addressing computational limits of MCMC for binary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational challenges faced by MCMC samplers in high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes.

Method: A mean-field variational Bayes approach is developed with a spike-and-slab prior, allowing closed-form updates and an efficient coordinate ascent algorithm.

Result: The method achieves fast and accurate variable selection with posterior inclusion probabilities, outperforming MCMC in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy in simulations and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient, interpretable, and accurate Bayesian framework for variable selection and prediction, suitable for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for analyzing temporal count data with regime-adaptive dynamics and Poisson log-normal distributions, which identifies disentangled components. Validation is done on simulated and real microbiome data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of temporal count observations necessitates advanced models to capture the underlying patterns and dynamics effectively.

Method: The proposed model uses independent component analysis with regime-adaptive dynamics and Poisson log-normal emissions. It employs an efficient amortized variational inference for parameter learning.

Result: Simulations showed effective recovery of mixing functions and latent sources. Real-world application to longitudinal microbiome data revealed patterns and regime shifts that correlate with clinical changes.

Conclusion: The framework enables representation learning and analysis of temporal count data, offering interpretable and reliable results for diverse applications.

Abstract: Advances in data collection are producing growing volumes of temporal count observations, making adapted modeling increasingly necessary. In this work, we introduce a generative framework for independent component analysis of temporal count data, combining regime-adaptive dynamics with Poisson log-normal emissions. The model identifies disentangled components with regime-dependent contributions, enabling representation learning and perturbations analysis. Notably, we establish the identifiability of the model, supporting principled interpretation. To learn the parameters, we propose an efficient amortized variational inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data evaluate recovery of the mixing function and latent sources across diverse settings, while an in vivo longitudinal gut microbiome study reveals microbial co-variation patterns and regime shifts consistent with clinical perturbations.

TL;DR: This paper develops a causal framework for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using statistical methods, rejects the concept of a central "hub" goal, and proposes a tiered priority framework for achieving the SDGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance efficient resource distribution to achieve the 2030 SDGs by understanding their causal interdependencies.

Method: The paper uses Panel Vector Autoregression, conditional independence testing (PCMCI+), and country-specific fixed effects, analyzing data from 168 countries (2000–2025).

Result: A distributed causal network was found across the SDGs, with no central 'keystone' SDG. A notable direct relationship was Education reducing inequality significantly. Income level influenced effect magnitude.

Conclusion: Strategic, coordinated multi-dimensional interventions are necessary to accelerate SDG achievement; single-goal strategies are inadequate.

Abstract: The achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is dependent upon strategic resource distribution. We propose a causal discovery framework using Panel Vector Autoregression, along with both country-specific fixed effects and PCMCI+ conditional independence testing on 168 countries (2000-2025) to develop the first complete causal architecture of SDG dependencies. Utilizing 8 strategically chosen SDGs, we identify a distributed causal network (i.e., no single 'hub' SDG), with 10 statistically significant Granger-causal relationships identified as 11 unique direct effects. Education to Inequality is identified as the most statistically significant direct relationship (r = -0.599; p < 0.05), while effect magnitude significantly varies depending on income levels (e.g., high-income: r = -0.65; lower-middle-income: r = -0.06; non-significant). We also reject the idea that there exists a single 'keystone' SDG. Additionally, we offer a proposed tiered priority framework for the SDGs namely, identifying upstream drivers (Education, Growth), enabling goals (Institutions, Energy), and downstream outcomes (Poverty, Health). Therefore, we conclude that effective SDG acceleration can be accomplished through coordinated multi-dimensional intervention(s), and that single-goal sequential strategies are insufficient.

### [356] [Hierarchy of discriminative power and complexity in learning quantum ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22005)
*Jian Yao,Pengtao Li,Xiaohui Chen,Quntao Zhuang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new hierarchy of metrics, MMD-$k$, for measuring distances between quantum state ensembles, balancing discriminative power and statistical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of well-understood distance metrics for ensembles of quantum states under quantum measurement constraints.

Method: A hierarchy of integral probability metrics, MMD-$k$, that generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy for quantum ensembles; analysis of sample complexities using SWAP-test-based estimators.

Result: Estimation of MMD-$k$ requires $O(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$ and $O(N^3)$ for full power at $k=N$, whereas quantum Wasserstein distance reaches full power with $O(N^2 \log N)$ samples.

Conclusion: The MMD-$k$ metrics offer a trade-off between discriminative power and efficiency, guiding loss function design in quantum machine learning, demonstrated in quantum denoising diffusion models.

Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

*Gustav Norén,Anubhab Ghosh,Fredrik Cumlin,Saikat Chatterjee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-free variational state estimation (VSE) method using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to provide Gaussian posteriors for complex dynamic processes, demonstrating strong performance against benchmark methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient state estimation technique that does not require physics-based models for complex, model-free dynamic processes, while maintaining computational simplicity.

Method: The VSE methodology relies on two recurrent neural networks (RNNs): one to infer a closed-form Gaussian posterior during inference, and the other assisting in the learning phase based on variational inference principles.

Result: VSE was tested on a tracking application using stochastic Lorenz system data and outperformed a data-driven state estimation method while being competitive with particle filtering methods that rely on process models.

Conclusion: The proposed VSE proves effective for state estimation tasks without prior knowledge of system dynamics, leveraging RNNs for efficient learning and inference, offering a competitive and computationally simple alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.
