This paper\nintroduces the design elements of the Scry instruction set architecture that\nmost significantly affect instruction density and encoding efficiency. Scry is\na novel and experimental instruction set that revisits first principles to\ndesign an instruction set fit for modern processor implementations. Scry uses\nforward-temporal referencing as a means of data flow, where instructions refer\nto which future instructions consume their outputs. It also uses internal\ntagging, where the processors track data types internally, to reduce the number\nof instructions needed and increase flexibility. Combining these two methods,\nScry achieves instruction-feature parity with RISC-V's RV64IMC using only\n2-byte instructions compared to RISC-V's 4 bytes. Scry's instructions occupy\nonly 28% of the 2-byte encoding space, where RV64IMC instructions occupy 68% of\nthe 4-byte encoding space.

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from\nInterstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated\ndegrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a\nhigh-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that\nTARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple\npreviously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search\nis likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and\nreinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces TARS3D, a robotic platform inspired by the TARS robot from Interstellar, capable of bipedal walking and rolling.

Designing such\nmissions requires rapid exploration of the tradespace between control cost and\nflight time across multiple candidate targets. However, multi-objective\noptimization in this setting is challenging, as the underlying constraints are\noften highly nonconvex, and mission designers must balance accuracy (e.g.,\nsolving the full problem) with efficiency (e.g., convex relaxations), slowing\niteration and limiting design agility. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AI-powered framework that enables agile mission design for a wide\nrange of Earth orbit rendezvous scenarios. Given the orbital information of the\ntarget spacecraft, boundary conditions, and a range of flight times, this work\nproposes a Transformer-based architecture that generates, in a single\nparallelized inference step, a set of near-Pareto optimal trajectories across\nvarying flight times, thereby enabling rapid mission trade studies. The model\nis further extended to accommodate variable flight times and perturbed orbital\ndynamics, supporting realistic multi-objective trade-offs. Validation on\nchance-constrained rendezvous problems with passive safety constraints\ndemonstrates that the model generalizes across both flight times and dynamics,\nconsistently providing high-quality initial guesses that converge to superior\nsolutions in fewer iterations. Moreover, the framework efficiently approximates\nthe Pareto front, achieving runtimes comparable to convex relaxation by\nexploiting parallelized inference. Together, these results position the\nproposed framework as a practical surrogate for nonconvex trajectory generation\nand mark an important step toward AI-driven trajectory design for accelerating\npreliminary mission planning in real-world rendezvous applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces an AI-based framework to streamline mission design and generate near-Pareto optimal trajectories for Earth orbit rendezvous, addressing nonconvex optimization challenges effectively.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the trade-off between control cost and flight time in spacecraft rendezvous missions and improve efficiency while dealing with the challenges of solving nonconvex underlying constraints.", "method": "The paper proposes a Transformer-based AI architecture that generates near-Pareto optimal trajectories across flight times in a single parallelized inference step.

MetaFind addresses two core\nchallenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,\nand stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval\nparadigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches\nmainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key\ninnovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary\ncombinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial\nreasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features\n(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,\nMetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that\ncaptures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring\nretrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the\nexisting scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework\nsupports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval\nresults to current scene updates.

Additional layers of complexities arise due to\nthe problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time\ndetection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving\nat results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges,\nvery strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper\npresents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that\nexploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models.

This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a \"Persuadee\nAgent\" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party\npersuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue\nexperiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating\nthe Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and\nthe presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee\nAgent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude\nchange significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker\nwas also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change.\nAdditionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants\nincreased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results\nsuggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion\nthrough the conformity effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies if humans exhibit the 'conformity effect' influenced by AI and finds that an AI Persuadee Agent can enhance persuasion when it aligns with the persuader.", "motivation": "To examine whether and how the 'conformity effect,' typically observed among humans, can be leveraged using AI agents in persuasive scenarios.", "method": "The researchers conducted a text-based dialogue experiment involving participants interacting with a Persuader Agent and a Persuadee Agent under different conditions, varying persuasion acceptance and presence of an initial icebreaker session.", "result": "The study found that when the Persuadee Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude change improved notably, especially when combined with an icebreaker session.

To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models\nwith defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly\neffective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR\nagainst GPT-4o and a $72\\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy\ndefense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in\nattacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity\nobjectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection\ndetectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the\ndevelopment of stronger, more principled defenses.
