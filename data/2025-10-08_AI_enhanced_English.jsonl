This paper introduces the Deterministic Causal Structure (DCS), a\nformal foundation that decouples correctness from policy. We develop a minimal\naxiomatic theory and prove four results: existence and uniqueness,\npolicy-agnostic invariance, observational equivalence, and axiom minimality.\nThese results show that DCS resolves causal ambiguities that value-centric\nconvergence models such as CRDTs cannot address, and that removing any axiom\ncollapses determinism into ambiguity. DCS thus emerges as a boundary principle\nof asynchronous computation, analogous to CAP and FLP: correctness is preserved\nonly within the expressive power of a join-semilattice. All guarantees are\nestablished by axioms and proofs, with only minimal illustrative constructions\nincluded to aid intuition.

The success of LCMs\ncan be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information\nwithin the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals\nthat LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,\nthat can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained\nanalysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated\nGradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the\ncontext. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context\nnoise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and\nbenefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context\nDenoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy\nthat improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on\nmodel predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context\nwindow scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority\nof CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve\nperformance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Context Denoising Training (CDT), a strategy to mitigate contextual noise in long-context models (LCMs), achieving performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4o.", "motivation": "LCMs struggle with contextual noise, which misleads model attention and hampers prediction accuracy.

We further allow\nvalue functions (games) and thus their M\\\"obius transforms (synergy function)\nand Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a\nring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve\nthis and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,\nefficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine\nShapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two\nnovel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to\ninterpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of\nhigher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of\nthe null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements\nand flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with\nvanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The\nlatter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of\nhierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply\na unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical\nproperties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the\nprojection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion\nalgebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain\npreviously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new\nperspective.
