### [1] [OR-Toolformer: Modeling and Solving Operations Research Problems with Tool Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01253)
*Jianzhang Zhang,Jialong Zhou,Chuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OR-Toolformer, a fine-tuned version of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for solving operations research (OR) problems, achieving high accuracy through tool-augmented fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliance on closed-source APIs for mathematical reasoning creates privacy concerns, and training open-source models is computationally expensive.

Method: OR-Toolformer fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct using a semi-automatic data pipeline for generating OR problem-answer pairs, augmented with external solver integration to produce API calls.

Result: OR-Toolformer achieved up to 80.1% execution accuracy on most benchmarks, outperforming baselines by over 4.3%, and demonstrated a 21 percentage-point improvement in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented fine-tuning provides an effective approach to enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of large language models in solving OR problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

### [2] [Modeling Others' Minds as Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01272)
*Kunal Jha,Aydan Yuenan Huang,Eric Ye,Natasha Jaques,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROTE, an algorithm combining large language models and probabilistic inference to predict human behavior efficiently using behavioral programs, outperforming existing methods in tasks and simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of predicting human behavior are often inefficient, requiring large data sets and making unrealistic assumptions, or being computationally intensive. A better approach is needed to model routine behaviors that follow predictable patterns to improve human-AI collaboration.

Method: The authors propose ROTE, a novel method that utilizes large language models to synthesize a space of behavioral programs and applies probabilistic inference to manage uncertainty. This approach departs from belief-and-desire-based policies to model behaviors as executable programs.

Result: ROTE demonstrated significant improvements in predicting human and AI behavior, achieving up to a 50% increase in in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization in both gridworld tasks and a household simulator compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: By framing action understanding as a program synthesis issue, ROTE provides an efficient solution for predicting human behavior, paving the way for safer and more reliable human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

### [3] [Cyber Academia-Chemical Engineering (CA-ChemE): A Living Digital Town for Self-Directed Research Evolution and Emergent Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01293)
*Zekun Jiang,Chunming Xu,Tianhang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CA-ChemE system, an AI-driven digital platform for interdisciplinary collaboration in chemical engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems struggle with interdisciplinary collaboration and uncharted problem-solving in chemical engineering.

Method: The system integrates domain-specific knowledge bases, enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents to build an intelligent ecosystem.

Result: Knowledge-enhancement improved dialogue quality by 10-15%, while ontology-equipped collaboration agents boosted cross-domain collaboration efficiency by up to 10.6-fold.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems with targeted design offer promising pathways for autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

### [4] [The Social Laboratory: A Psychometric Framework for Multi-Agent LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01295)
*Zarreen Reza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using multi-agent debate as a novel evaluation framework to assess the social and cognitive dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess the interactive social and cognitive dynamics of LLMs as they evolve into autonomous agents, making them inadequate for evaluating their full capabilities.

Method: The authors designed a multi-agent debate framework where LLMs, with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on challenging topics under an LLM moderator’s supervision. New psychometric and semantic metrics were introduced for evaluation.

Result: The analysis showed a strong emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, high semantic agreement even on sensitive topics, and persona-induced psychometric profiles for agents. The persona of the moderator influenced debate outcomes, highlighting challenges in AI alignment.

Conclusion: The paper presents a psychometrically grounded evaluation methodology for AI agents, highlighting its importance for understanding and shaping their interactive social behaviors, and provides the accompanying tools publicly.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

### [5] [Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01304)
*Yu Zeng,Wenxuan Huang,Shiting Huang,Xikun Bao,Yukun Qi,Yiming Zhao,Qiuchen Wang,Lin Chen,Zehui Chen,Huaian Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE enhances visual perception and reasoning in VLMs using interactive jigsaw solving, significantly improving task performance and generalization across additional vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack sufficient perceptual and reasoning abilities, hindering their performance in tasks like jigsaw solving and limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.

Method: AGILE uses an iterative interactive jigsaw solving process where a model generates actions based on its current state and receives fine-grained feedback to progressively refine perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Result: AGILE achieves a massive performance boost in jigsaw-solving tasks, from 9.5% to 82.8% accuracy, and improves generalization across 9 vision tasks with an average enhancement of 3.1%.

Conclusion: AGILE addresses fundamental limitations in multimodal VLM perception and reasoning through efficient exploration and feedback, advancing multimodal reasoning and generalization scalability.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Method: Aristotle combines a Lean proof search system, informal reasoning for lemma generation and formalization, and a specialized geometry solver.

Result: Achieved gold-medal-equivalent performance on 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad problems, demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities.

Conclusion: The system showcases favorable scaling properties for future applications in automated theorem proving and complex problem-solving.

Abstract: We introduce Aristotle, an AI system that combines formal verification with
informal reasoning, achieving gold-medal-equivalent performance on the 2025
International Mathematical Olympiad problems. Aristotle integrates three main
components: a Lean proof search system, an informal reasoning system that
generates and formalizes lemmas, and a dedicated geometry solver. Our system
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with favorable scaling properties for
automated theorem proving.

### [7] [MEMTRACK: Evaluating Long-Term Memory and State Tracking in Multi-Platform Dynamic Agent Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01353)
*Darshan Deshpande,Varun Gangal,Hersh Mehta,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEMTRACK is a benchmark designed to evaluate memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments, focusing on realistic organizational workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for memory evaluation in dynamic enterprise settings beyond conversational contexts.

Method: MEMTRACK integrates asynchronous events and interleaved timelines across platforms like Slack and Git, assessing memory capabilities via expert design and agent-based synthesis.

Result: Experiments show the challenges for state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing model achieving only 60% Correctness.

Conclusion: MEMTRACK is an extensible framework that broadens memory evaluation research for agents in complex, real-world organizational workflows.

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Framework for LLM-Based Clinical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01363)
*Leon Garza,Anantaa Kotal,Michael A. Grasso,Emre Umucu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a clinical decision support system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in prescribing decisions by analyzing historical electronic health record (EHR) data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing complexity of clinical decisions and leverage the wealth of data contained in electronic health records for enhancing data-informed care.

Method: The system integrates natural language processing with structured clinical data using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to provide context-specific therapeutic suggestions. It synthesizes information from local or federated datasets for decision support.

Result: Preliminary evaluations on de-identified and synthetic datasets suggest the system delivers clinically plausible and consistent recommendations, demonstrating potential value in prescribing workflows.

Conclusion: The study highlights that LLM-based decision support systems, with proper constraints and validation, can aid clinicians while prioritizing transparency, safety, and alignment with clinical practices.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

### [9] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a method to detect implicit reward hacking in reasoning models by quantifying the effort a model uses to achieve high rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of reward hacking, where models exploit reward function loopholes to bypass solving tasks in the intended way.

Method: TRACE measures a model's reasoning effort by truncating its chain-of-thought at different lengths, forcing an answer, and evaluating the verifier-passing rate to detect shortcuts.

Result: TRACE achieves significant improvements in detecting hacking, with over 65% gains in math reasoning and 30% gains in coding compared to state-of-the-art monitors. It can also discover previously unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a scalable and unsupervised solution for monitoring reward hacking, particularly when existing methods are ineffective.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

### [10] [Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375)
*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to train large language model agents to internalize retrieval-augmented guidance, improving task performance and efficiency without requiring ongoing external retrieval at runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language model agents often fail at multi-step tasks due to predictable issues like unmet preconditions and redundant commands. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves performance but at the cost of increased computational overhead and reliance on external knowledge bases.

Method: The authors propose a three-step pipeline: extract failure-induced hints, use them for one-shot retrieval to craft enhanced teacher trajectories, and train student models on these trajectories with hints removed, enabling them to internalize the learned guidance.

Result: Across two benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), student models trained with this pipeline outperformed baseline agents, achieving higher task success rates (91% vs. 79% in ALFWorld) and efficiency improvements (10-60% fewer tokens), regardless of model scale or architecture.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized into language model agents through fine-tuning, reducing deployment complexity and improving both performance and token efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

### [11] [Automating Data-Driven Modeling and Analysis for Engineering Applications using Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01398)
*Yang Liu,Zaid Abulawi,Abhiram Garimidi,Doyeong Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for automating data-driven regression modeling, achieving performance equivalent to or better than human expert-developed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and generalized modeling strategies in engineering and science, focusing on automating complex data-driven tasks to minimize manual intervention and enhance predictive efficiency.

Method: The study employs two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system and a single-agent system using the ReAct paradigm, both tasked with automating data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter tuning, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The LLM-agent-developed model demonstrated predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification matching state-of-the-art human methods on the critical heat flux (CHF) prediction dataset, outperforming traditional lookup table approaches.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents can effectively automate sophisticated engineering modeling with minimal human intervention, maintaining or surpassing human-level standards while drastically reducing workload.

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

### [12] [OntoLogX: Ontology-Guided Knowledge Graph Extraction from Cybersecurity Logs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01409)
*Luca Cotti,Idilio Drago,Anisa Rula,Devis Bianchini,Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX is an AI-driven system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert unstructured system logs into ontology-based Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), linking low-level log data to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extract actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) from noisy and fragmented system logs to identify attacker behaviors and adversarial objectives.

Method: OntoLogX employs a combination of LLMs, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), log ontology integration, iterative correction, KG aggregation, and tactic prediction using MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Result: OntoLogX demonstrated robust Knowledge Graph generation with high precision and recall across log datasets and accurate mapping of attacker behavior to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Conclusion: Ontology-grounded representations, supported by LLM-powered retrieval and correction processes, enable effective and actionable CTI extraction, highlighting the role of structured analysis in cybersecurity.

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

*Sipeng Zhang,Longfei Yun,Zilong Wang,Jingbo Shang,Letian Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer is a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with lightweight proxy models for efficient and scalable knowledge mining, reducing costs and improving speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of knowledge mining are efficient but lack generalization, while LLMs, though powerful, are costly at scale. Falconer aims to address these limitations by combining their strengths.

Method: Falconer uses LLMs for planning and supervision while employing lightweight proxy models for execution. It unifies classification and extraction tasks under a single model with consistent benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: Falconer achieves accuracy comparable to leading LLMs, cuts inference costs by 90%, and accelerates large-scale tasks by over 20 times, ensuring consistency between proxy models and human/machine annotations.

Conclusion: Falconer provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for knowledge mining, merging efficiency with generalization capabilities, making it suitable for extensive Deep Research.

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

### [14] [On the Role of Domain Experts in Creating Effective Tutoring Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01432)
*Sarath Sreedharan,Kelsey Sikes,Nathaniel Blanchard,Lisa Mason,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Jill Zarestky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses how highly curated expert knowledge can enhance AI educational systems through automated lesson generation using explainable AI (XAI) and adaptive curriculum design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of attention given to expert-curated knowledge in developing effective AI-based tutoring systems.

Method: The paper explores two approaches: using explainable AI (XAI) techniques and expert-defined rules for lesson generation, and designing adaptive tutoring systems with expert-specified learning curricula.

Result: The proposed methods have potential applications in developing efficient and better educational systems; a case study on pollinator identification exemplifies the approach.

Conclusion: Expert-curated knowledge can play a critical role in advancing AI educational systems, both in lesson development and adaptive learning frameworks.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

### [15] [VOGUE: Guiding Exploration with Visual Uncertainty Improves Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01444)
*Rui Liu,Dian Yu,Tong Zheng,Runpeng Dai,Zongxia Li,Wenhao Yu,Zhenwen Liang,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Pratap Tokekar,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VOGUE, a method to enhance exploration in multimodal LLMs by focusing on the uncertainty in visual inputs, and shows improvement in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to reinforcement learning in multimodal large language models overlook visual uncertainty, leading to suboptimal exploration and reasoning performance.

Method: The approach, VOGUE, uses visual uncertainty by treating the image as a stochastic context and incorporates KL divergence between raw and noisy branches as an exploration signal. This signal is augmented with an uncertainty-proportional bonus, token-entropy bonus, and an annealed sampling mechanism.

Result: VOGUE demonstrated an average improvement of 2.6% in pass@1 accuracy on visual math benchmarks and 3.7% in general-domain reasoning, along with addressing exploration decay.

Conclusion: Grounding exploration in visual uncertainty enhances multimodal reasoning, offering insights for robust RL fine-tuning in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIReg-Bench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is significant interest in leveraging LLMs to ensure AI systems meet regulations. However, there was no prior benchmark for assessing their ability to perform such compliance evaluations.

Method: The authors developed a dataset by generating technical documentation samples using structured LLM prompts. These samples were reviewed and annotated by legal experts to label compliance with specific AIA articles.

Result: The dataset and evaluation results demonstrate the ability and limitations of LLMs in replicating expert compliance assessments, setting a baseline for future comparisons.

Conclusion: AIReg-Bench provides a foundational tool for benchmarking LLMs in AI regulation compliance, aiding in the understanding and development of regulation-focused assessment tools.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [17] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), a technique to improve search algorithms under large test-time compute budgets by addressing issues of breadth saturation and depth myopia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome inefficiencies in standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search algorithms associated with large compute budgets: breadth saturation and depth myopia.

Method: The LToT framework separates utility from logical consistency, categorizing search candidates into high-utility mainlines and low-utility consistent laterals. It employs a capped successive-halving race, called Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR-SC), for probing lateral candidates while managing compute costs effectively.

Result: No empirical results are presented yet; benchmark evaluations are forthcoming in a future revision.

Conclusion: LToT addresses key inefficiencies in Tree-of-Thoughts-style search, enabling principled diversity without excessive computation overhead, and is a drop-in solution suitable for large compute contexts.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

*Daniel Zhao,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Lanxiang Hu,Tajana Rosing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes analyzing token representations in large language models using sparse autoencoders and clustering to enhance mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs) by balancing exploitative and exploratory reasoning.

Method: A sparse autoencoder generates sparse vector representations for tokens, k-means clustering forms token graphs, and an edge-weight based reward evaluates reasoning and diversity.

Result: Balanced exploitation and exploration proved to improve accuracy in reasoning tasks, with the sparse autoencoder as a scalable guide for generation quality.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances reasoning quality by preventing extreme behaviors, enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

*Navapat Nananukul,Yue Zhang,Ryan Lee,Eric Boxer,Jonathan May,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate,Jay Pujara,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'LOGicalThought (LogT),' a neurosymbolic architecture that enhances reasoning in high-assurance domains like law and medicine, outperforming baselines by 11.84%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate, verifiable, and evidence-grounded reasoning in critical domains, particularly when handling defeasible logic with exceptions.

Method: The authors propose LogT, which combines advanced logical language and reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to create dual context representations: a symbolic graph and a logic-based context.

Result: LogT was evaluated across four multi-domain benchmarks and demonstrated a significant performance improvement of 11.84% over baselines, with notable gains in modes of reasoning such as negation (+10.2%), implication (+13.2%), and defeasible reasoning (+5.5%).

Conclusion: LogT effectively bridges the gap between natural language processing capabilities of LLMs and the rigorous reasoning demands of high-assurance domains, providing an enhanced framework for logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

### [20] [Information Seeking for Robust Decision Making under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01531)
*Djengo Cyun-Jyun Fang,Tsung-Wei Ke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker is a decision-making framework that combines planning and information-seeking in Large Language Models (LLMs) to address discrepancies between internal dynamics and the true environment, achieving significant performance improvements under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in LLM planning agents that overlook the misalignment between their internal dynamics and the actual environmental states, which is crucial for robust decision-making in noisy and uncertain environments.

Method: The authors propose InfoSeeker, a framework that prompts LLMs to actively seek information by planning actions to test hypotheses, detect environmental changes, and validate its understanding. This process aligns the model's internal dynamics with reality.

Result: Experiments on a novel benchmark suite for partially observable environments with uncertain dynamics show a 74% performance gain over prior methods. InfoSeeker also generalizes across LLMs and outperforms baselines on established tasks like robotic manipulation and web navigation.

Conclusion: The integration of information-seeking with planning is critical for effective decision-making in uncertain and partially observable environments. InfoSeeker demonstrates robust and generalized improvements, highlighting its potential for complex tasks.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

### [21] [Step-Aware Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01544)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Xiangchen Song,Xinshuai Dong,Guangyi Chen,Eric P. Xing,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) face challenges in complex reasoning, often reinforced by existing RL approaches relying on sparse rewards. A new theoretical framework and Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO) method address these issues, improving reasoning benchmarks and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the capability of diffusion language models (dLLMs) for complex reasoning tasks by addressing issues inherent in sparse-reward reinforcement learning algorithms.

Method: It introduces a theoretical framework to decompose reasoning into hierarchical, logical steps and proposes Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), which uses process-based rewards to align the model's refinement steps with structured reasoning.

Result: SAPO demonstrated significant performance improvements on challenging reasoning benchmarks compared to existing methods while also enhancing the interpretability of the reasoning process.

Conclusion: Structured reinforcement learning approaches, like SAPO, provide a promising path to overcome reasoning deficiencies in dLLMs, making them more reliable and interpretable for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink introduces inverse reasoning to large language models (LLMs) for better safety, outperforming traditional methods across various domains and maintaining reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing safety alignment methods by equipping LLMs with the ability to reason about potential failure modes before generating responses.

Method: Introduces the InvThink process, where models are trained to 1) list potential risks, 2) analyze their impact, and 3) generate harm-free outputs through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: InvThink shows better scaling with model size, avoids safety tax by maintaining general reasoning skills, and excels in high-stakes safety tasks with up to 15.7% fewer harmful responses compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning, as implemented in InvThink, provides a scalable, generalizable way to enhance the safety and capability of language models.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvEvo-MARL, a framework addressing safety in multi-agent systems by co-evolving attackers and defenders, achieving lower attack success rates (ASR) under 20% while maintaining or improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems suffer from safety risks such as jailbreaks and adversarial prompts, and current defenses are ineffective or resource-intensive. The authors aim to create a more robust solution that enhances safety without increasing system complexity or overhead.

Method: The authors propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where task agents are optimized to handle adversarial attacks within the system. Attackers evolve to create challenges for defenders, while a shared advantage estimation method stabilizes intra-group coordination and learning.

Result: The framework consistently keeps the attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, surpassing baseline methods that have ASRs as high as 38.33%. Additionally, AdvEvo-MARL maintains and even improves task accuracy, with up to a +3.67% improvement on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AdvEvo-MARL shows that integrating safety measures within task agents, rather than relying on external guards, can simultaneously enhance system safety and task performance while avoiding added complexity and cost.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations in conversational recommender systems, such as inability to handle dynamic user preferences and balance ranking objectives efficiently.

Method: Utilizes hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence, employing specialized LLM-powered agents for various tasks co-managed by an adaptive weighting mechanism. Incorporates a three-tier learning strategy.

Result: Achieves improvements such as 2.8% better conversation success rate, 1.9% higher recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2% enhanced conversation efficiency across three datasets.

Conclusion: AgentRec offers a scalable, efficient, and superior approach to conversational recommender systems, improving flexibility and interaction outcomes while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

*Min Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o to act as psychological counselors by testing their ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam using a new benchmark, PsychoBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether LLMs can be effectively applied to psychological counseling, an area requiring cognitive abilities, by evaluating their capability to meet certification standards.

Method: The authors introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam, consisting of 2,252 questions. They evaluate various LLMs' performance on this benchmark.

Result: Advanced LLMs like GPT-4o achieve well above the passing threshold of 70%, while smaller open-source models score significantly lower.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that only advanced LLMs are currently capable of meeting the standards for psychological counseling roles, shedding light on their potential and the challenges of creating specialized counseling LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

*Peidong Liu,Junjiang Lin,Shaowen Wang,Yao Xu,Haiqing Li,Xuhao Xie,Siyi Wu,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that uses large language models to compress contextual inputs in CMDPs, enhancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMDP methods struggle with generalization in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, leading to inefficiency and instability.

Method: An information-theoretic summarization approach using LLMs to create low-dimensional summaries to preserve decision-critical information while reducing redundancy.

Result: The proposed method improves performance across various benchmarks, enhancing reward, success rate, sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage.

Conclusion: LLM-based summarization is effective and scalable for decision-making in complex and resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,

*Thinh Hung Truong,Jey Han Lau,Jianzhong Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform geospatial reasoning and navigation by reconstructing GPS traces using a new dataset called GLOBALTRACE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs can comprehend road networks and perform effective navigation tasks without external tools.

Method: A proxy task for trajectory recovery using the GLOBALTRACE dataset and a prompting framework to enable LLMs to generate navigation paths.

Result: LLMs outperform traditional methods and demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization, while revealing certain biases based on regions and transportation modes.

Conclusion: LLMs excel in map reasoning and navigation tasks but require improvement to address systematic biases for enhanced user adaptation.

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

*Erfan Shayegani,Keegan Hines,Yue Dong,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh,Roman Lutz,Spencer Whitehead,Vidhisha Balachandran,Besmira Nushi,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the risks of Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD) in Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) and introduces a benchmark, BLIND-ACT, to evaluate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential safety, feasibility, and reliability issues in CUAs caused by their bias towards pursuing goals blindly.

Method: Development of BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks built on OSWorld, along with evaluations using LLM-based judges and nine frontier models to assess BGD patterns.

Result: High BGD rates (80.8%) observed across tested models, revealing vulnerabilities like execution-first bias and thought-action disconnect.

Conclusion: BGD introduces substantial risks to CUAs, even with mitigative strategies like prompting-based interventions. Stronger solutions are needed for safe deployment.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

*Motoki Sato,Yuki Matsushita,Hidekazu Takahashi,Tomoaki Kakazu,Sou Nagata,Mizuho Ohnuma,Atsushi Yoshikawa,Masayuki Yamamura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LENOHA, a system for answering pre-procedural clinical questions using a high-precision classifier and pre-curated FAQs, avoiding generation errors and prioritizing privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in providing personalized answers to patients’ pre-procedural questions due to time constraints and privacy concerns in clinical workflows.

Method: LENOHA employs a sentence-transformer classifier to route inputs and responds with exact matches from clinician-curated FAQs, avoiding free-text generation. The system was tested using validation and independent datasets.

Result: The E5-large-instruct encoder attained an accuracy of 0.983 with an energy consumption of ~1.0 mWh per input in clinical tasks, demonstrating superior efficiency and error avoidance compared to generative models.

Conclusion: LENOHA enables safe, private, energy-efficient, and equitable clinical query resolution by structurally eliminating errors and maintaining sustainability in constrained environments.

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

*John Hawkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AGI evaluation methods and proposes an alternative approach focusing on task competence rather than synthetic tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI evaluation methods rely heavily on synthetic tasks guided by intuitive ideas of intelligence, which have historically failed to accurately measure AI progress.

Method: The authors propose a shift towards evaluation based on robust task execution and competence, inspired by practices in data science used for system deployment.

Result: The paper delivers practical examples of how robust task execution methods could be implemented to assess AGI systems.

Conclusion: Evaluating AGI systems through competence-driven frameworks rather than intuition-based synthetic tasks could offer better insights into AGI robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

*Rohan Wadhawan,Fabrice Y Harel-Canada,Zi-Yi Dou,Suhaila Shakiah,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces a hard-negative response framework and VaPR dataset to improve LVLMs alignment with human preferences, addressing noisy annotations and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference finetuning methods do not adequately account for noise in synthetic preference annotations, such as stylistic and length biases.

Method: The researchers develop a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided response editing. This framework generates rejected responses with targeted errors preserving stylistic and length similarity. They also create the VaPR dataset with 30K samples to fine-tune three LVLM families.

Result: VaPR models yield notable performance improvements across ten benchmarks with gains averaging 6.5% for LLaVA, 4.0% for Qwen2VL, and 1.5% for Qwen2.5VL. They excel in reasoning tasks and show scalable improvements with more data.

Conclusion: The VaPR framework effectively addresses biases in LVLMs, improves performance even at smaller scales, and generalizes well to open-source models.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be
found on the project page https://vap-r.github.io

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaboT, an AI system that uses large language models (LLMs) to help users interact with metabolomics knowledge graphs by automatically generating SPARQL queries from natural language questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify access to knowledge graphs in metabolomics, which traditionally require users to understand complex ontologies and query language syntax.

Method: MetaboT employs a multi-agent system with components like Entry Agent, Validator Agent, Supervisor Agent, and Knowledge Graph Agent to break down tasks and generate accurate SPARQL queries using LangChain and LangGraph libraries.

Result: MetaboT achieved 83.67% accuracy in retrieving correct entities and queries, significantly outperforming the baseline system (GPT-4o) which achieved only 8.16% accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaboT bridges the gap between complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction, enabling researchers to effortless query knowledge graphs, thereby facilitating data-driven discoveries in metabolomics.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in aligning AI characteristics with operational cybersecurity standards to tackle modern cyber threats.

Method: Decomposing NIST CSF 2.0 functions into tasks and linking AI properties like autonomy and learning with security requirements.

Result: Conceptual validation of the framework shows improved situational awareness and faster response to cyber incidents using tailored AI deployments.

Conclusion: The framework bridges theoretical AI concepts with practical cybersecurity applications, enabling robust multi-agent systems aligned with industry standards.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the importance of integrating AI effectively and ethically into military operations amidst rapid technological and environmental changes.

Method: The paper proposes a co-learning model incorporating adjustable autonomy, multi-layered control, bidirectional feedback, and collaborative decision-making, highlighting dynamic adaptation and interaction between human and AI agents.

Result: The model facilitates adaptive and ethical integration of human-AI systems in military environments, ensuring safety, accountability, and robust decision-making.

Conclusion: The research provides concrete recommendations for enhancing responsible human-AI teaming systems in military settings, emphasizing trustworthiness and adaptability.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

*Zhihao Dou,Qinjian Zhao,Zhongwei Wan,Dinggen Zhang,Weida Wang,Towsif Raiyan,Benteng Chen,Qingtao Pan,Yang Ouyang,Zhiqiang Gao,Shufei Zhang,Sumon Biswas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning by proposing a two-stage framework, PTA-GRPO, which improves high-level planning and fine-grained Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experimental results show stable and significant improvements across diverse models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning, particularly in overcoming issues like redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which are caused by the lack of global planning in local decision-making.

Method: The proposed method, PTA-GRPO, includes two stages: (1) High-level guidance distillation using advanced LLMs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and (2) A guidance-aware reinforcement learning (RL) method to jointly enhance the final output and the quality of high-level guidance.

Result: Through experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, AMC) and using diverse LLMs (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, LLaMA3.2-3B), PTA-GRPO shows consistent improvements in reasoning performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: The two-stage framework successfully tackles the reasoning deficiencies of LLMs by boosting both high-level planning and fine-grained reasoning, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper refines adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to train large language models using dense, token-level reward models for improved multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a unified framework to improve large language models' reasoning by using token-level rewards to enhance step-by-step supervision.

Method: The authors leverage dense reasoning rewards learned from expert demonstrations, optimizing reasoning policies and reranking sampled traces based on correctness during inference.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K with Llama3 and Qwen2.5 show improved reasoning elicitation and predictive performance, particularly via reward-guided reranking.

Conclusion: The approach integrates training, inference, and diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, highlighting the potential for reusable process-level rewards to improve reasoning in language models.

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), improving sample efficiency and diversity in constrained generation tasks without distorting language model distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained generation methods either distort language model distributions or waste computation, leading to inefficiencies in domains requiring both validity and diversity in samples.

Method: CARS adaptively prunes invalid continuations using a trie structure during sampling to ensure efficient generation while maintaining fidelity to the LM's distribution.

Result: Experiments show CARS achieves higher efficiency and sample diversity compared to greedy constrained decoding (GCD) and other approximation methods.

Conclusion: CARS effectively balances sample efficiency and fidelity to LM distributions, making it a novel solution for applications like program fuzzing and molecular generation.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human social reasoning in collective decision-making using a detailed empirical framework and dynamic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate how LLMs align with human collective reasoning to ensure the development of socially-aligned AI.

Method: The authors use the Lost at Sea task and conduct a large-scale online experiment with 748 participants. Groups are randomized to different leader selection conditions, and matched LLM groups are simulated to benchmark their behavior using specific AI models.

Result: LLM behaviors vary, with some models mirroring human biases and others compensating for them. Human-AI alignment in collective reasoning is found to vary based on context, cues, and the model's inductive biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complexity of aligning LLMs with human collective behavior and emphasizes the necessity of dynamic benchmarks for understanding collective reasoning and advancing socially-aligned AI.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

*Khalid M. Saqr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deterministic simulation framework to evaluate AI-generated peer review reports, addressing the challenges in scholarly publishing due to submission volumes and unregulated AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address dual crises in scholarly publishing: overwhelming submission volumes and the unregulated use of AI in peer review processes.

Method: The research investigates a deterministic simulation framework that evaluates AI-generated peer review reports by analyzing 352 simulation reports to identify system reliability and procedural consistency.

Result: The framework demonstrated reliability, with majority 'Revise' decisions across disciplines and field-specific 'Reject' rates; it also maintained procedural integrity with a stable evidence-anchoring compliance rate.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the framework provides a scalable, transparent, and rule-bound system for peer review governance, ensuring fairness and mitigating risks in scholarly publishing.

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

### [42] [ReTabAD: A Benchmark for Restoring Semantic Context in Tabular Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02060)
*Sanghyu Yoon,Dongmin Kim,Suhee Yoon,Ye Seul Sim,Seungdong Yoa,Hye-Seung Cho,Soonyoung Lee,Hankook Lee,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReTabAD, which enriches tabular anomaly detection (AD) by incorporating domain-specific textual metadata to improve context-aware detection. It includes curated datasets, algorithm implementations, and a zero-shot LLM framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular anomaly detection benchmarks lack semantic context, limiting their ability to leverage domain-specific knowledge effectively.

Method: The authors curated 20 tabular datasets with textual metadata and implemented various AD algorithms, including a zero-shot large language model (LLM) framework, to explore the role of semantic context in AD.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that incorporating textual metadata improves anomaly detection performance and enhances interpretability due to domain-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: ReTabAD provides a strong foundation for exploring context-aware tabular AD, establishing it as a benchmark to advance research in this area.

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deeper layers in large language models (LLMs) have varying importance depending on evaluation settings and tasks, with middle and deeper layers crucial for reasoning and coherence in generation-based evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that deeper layers in LLMs are generally insignificant and provide a systematic exploration of their diverse contributions across tasks and evaluation metrics.

Method: The study evaluates depth utilization across different dimensions, such as evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures, analyzing performance for likelihood-based versus generation-based metrics.

Result: Deeper layers tend to be less effective under likelihood-based metrics, but are indispensable for reasoning and coherence in generation-based tasks. Shallow layers are concentrated with knowledge and retrieval capabilities.

Conclusion: Depth usage in LLMs is heterogeneous and task-dependent, requiring nuanced perspectives for interpreting and optimizing large models.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether state-of-the-art models truly recognize and reason with intended abstractions using ConceptARC, revealing limitations in both textual and visual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand if current models genuinely exhibit abstract reasoning capabilities or if they rely on surface-level patterns to achieve accuracy.

Method: The authors evaluated models across various settings, including input modality (text vs. visual), use of external tools, and reasoning effort. They analyzed both accuracy and the quality of natural-language rules generated.

Result: The study found that while some models equaled human accuracy in textual tasks, their reasoning often relied on shortcuts. In visual tasks, models underperformed in accuracy but captured intended abstractions more frequently, though they applied them incorrectly.

Conclusion: Current evaluations relying solely on accuracy overestimate models' abstract reasoning in textual tasks and underestimate it in visual tasks. The proposed evaluation framework better assesses their reasoning abilities and progress towards human-like intelligence.

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc is a synthetic data generation framework for semi-structured documents. It reduces annotation costs and improves Key Information Extraction (KIE) model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high costs, privacy issues, and manual annotation challenges in acquiring large, diverse, and well-annotated document datasets for enterprise-grade models.

Method: FlexDoc employs Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to create realistic and diverse synthetic documents with probabilistically controlled layout and content variability.

Result: Experiments reveal that using FlexDoc data enhances F1 Scores on KIE tasks by up to 11% and reduces annotation efforts by over 90%.

Conclusion: FlexDoc significantly reduces data acquisition and annotation costs while accelerating the development of enterprise document understanding models.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark and evaluation framework tailored for Deep Research Agents (DRAs), enabling multidimensional assessment of their performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are inadequate for effectively evaluating interconnected AI agent systems, such as DRAs, in tasks requiring external perception and reasoning.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark featuring 214 expert-curated queries across 10 domains and a framework including scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DRAs outperform models augmented with web search in report generation, but also highlight areas needing improvement.

Conclusion: The study establishes a robust foundation for evaluating and improving DRA systems, driving advancement in interconnected AI agent technology.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

*Yuhao Sun,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Kun Yang,Lingyun Yu,Yongdong Zhang,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors introduce a unified framework named UpSafe$^\circ$C to enhance the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically balancing safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face safety risks, such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks, and existing techniques struggle to balance safety, utility, and controllability.

Method: UpSafe$^\circ$C uses safety-aware upcycling, where critical layers are upcycled into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure with added safety experts and introduces a two-stage SFT strategy for better safety discrimination. It also employs a safety temperature mechanism for dynamic control during inference.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs while maintaining competitiveness on general tasks. The "safety temperature" allows achieving Pareto-optimal utility-safety trade-offs at inference time.

Conclusion: UpSafe$^\circ$C provides a modular, dynamic, and inference-aware approach to LLM safety, paving the path from static alignment techniques to adaptive safety control mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges faced in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for improving Large Language Models' reasoning abilities, identifying issues like negative interference and winner-take-all phenomena, and proposes a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the paradoxical shrinkage in reasoning capabilities observed in RLVR, despite its aim to enhance reasoning in Large Language Models.

Method: The authors analyze RLVR's learning dynamics, reveal key failure mechanisms (negative interference and winner-take-all phenomenon), and introduce a targeted data curation algorithm to address these issues.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analyses reveal RLVR's inherent flaws due to on-policy sampling, leading to narrow solution strategies, and demonstrate that the proposed data curation algorithm improves reasoning performance metrics.

Conclusion: The paper highlights critical issues in RLVR training dynamics, proposes a solution to address these failures, and presents evidence for enhanced reasoning performance with the new method.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method to improve the reliability and robustness of computer-use agents (CUAs) for complex digital tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the unreliability and high variance of computer-use agents in performing long and complex tasks, making them more practical for broader applications.

Method: The proposed bBoN method generates multiple rollouts of CUAs' actions and selects the best among them using behavior narratives, allowing for both exploration and structured decision-making.

Result: bBoN achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 69.9% on OSWorld, nearing human-level performance (72%) and showing strong generalization to other systems like WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: Scaling CUAs effectively requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN demonstrates how such a framework can significantly enhance CUAs' performance and robustness.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-player RL training paradigm, RLAD, that improves reasoning in models by leveraging reasoning abstractions—brief procedural guides to enhance solution generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge that most reasoning traces in large models fail to consistently capture reusable procedures, leading to verbose and ineffective problem-solving. It seeks to enhance effective reasoning in models.

Method: The authors propose reasoning abstractions as concise natural language guides for procedural and factual knowledge. They introduce RLAD, a two-player RL setup that trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator jointly. Structured exploration and decoupling of learning signals are key features.

Result: The method improves generalization to harder problems and shows that generating reasoning abstractions at test-time is more beneficial than generating additional solutions under high computational budgets.

Conclusion: Reasoning abstractions improve reasoning efficiency and guide structured exploration. RLAD leads to better solution generation and can handle more complex problem-solving scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioX-Bridge, a lightweight network for efficient unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer in biosignals, reducing trainable parameters by 88-99% while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of health monitoring systems by enabling knowledge transfer across biosignal modalities despite challenges like limited labeled datasets and computational overhead from large models.

Method: The proposed framework, BioX-Bridge, trains a lightweight bridge network to align intermediate representations across biosignal modalities. It includes strategies for selecting alignment positions and uses a prototype network as the bridge architecture.

Result: BioX-Bridge achieves an 88-99% reduction in trainable parameters while maintaining or even improving transfer performance, validated through experiments on various biosignal modalities, tasks, and datasets.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge provides an efficient and scalable solution to cross-modal knowledge transfer in biosignals, addressing computational and scalability challenges without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to execute Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) in-memory efficiently using Distributed Arithmetic (DA), reducing power and area consumption by eliminating ADCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector-Matrix Multiplication is fundamental to neural network inference but requires large data movements, making it suitable for optimized in-memory computation.

Method: The study extends the Distributed Arithmetic (DA) technique to VMM with a constant matrix, leveraging ReRAM memory and shift-and-add circuits, replacing traditional memory approaches.

Result: The proposed approach achieves 4.5x lower latency and 12x lower energy consumption compared to conventional bit slicing methods for VMM, while eliminating the need for ADCs.

Conclusion: By using DA, the paper introduces a significant improvement in in-memory VMM, reducing resource requirements and enhancing efficiency for neural network inference.

Abstract: Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required
computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data
movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory
computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant
power and area. `Distributed Arithmetic (DA)', a technique in computer
architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot
product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the
vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an
input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in
memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM
memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties
(latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using
energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves 4.5
x less latency and 12 x less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally
by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry
ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current
VMM implementations in memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of investigation into optimizing multi-model medical imaging systems with edge hardware accelerators.

Method: Utilized NVIDIA Jetson edge GPUs and DLAs to allocate AI model layers optimally, reducing hardware idle time. Fine-tuned GAN models to avoid fallback GPU execution while enhancing accuracy.

Result: Achieved a real-time throughput of 150 frames/second and improved accuracy by 5%. Doubled the performance of original models using optimized hardware allocation.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware AI models leveraging edge devices can significantly enhance medical imaging accuracy and throughput, proving effective for simultaneous reconstruction and diagnosis.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have greatly enhanced the medical imaging process, making
it quicker to diagnose patients. However, very few have investigated the
optimization of a multi-model system with hardware acceleration. As specialized
edge devices emerge, the efficient use of their accelerators is becoming
increasingly crucial. This paper proposes a hardware-accelerated method for
simultaneous reconstruction and diagnosis of \ac{MRI} from \ac{CT} images.
Real-time performance of achieving a throughput of nearly 150 frames per second
was achieved by leveraging hardware engines available in modern NVIDIA edge
GPU, along with scheduling techniques. This includes the GPU and the \ac{DLA}
available in both Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX Orin, which were considered
in this paper. The hardware allocation of different layers of the multiple AI
models was done in such a way that the ideal time between the hardware engines
is reduced. In addition, the AI models corresponding to the \ac{GAN} model were
fine-tuned in such a way that no fallback execution into the GPU engine is
required without compromising accuracy. Indeed, the accuracy corresponding to
the fine-tuned edge GPU-aware AI models exhibited an accuracy enhancement of
5\%. A further hardware allocation of two fine-tuned GPU-aware GAN models
proves they can double the performance over the original model, leveraging
adequate partitioning on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Orin devices. The
results prove the effectiveness of employing hardware-aware models in parallel
for medical image analysis and diagnosis.

Method: The researchers used in-context concept learning experiments with their introduced dataset to test biases, particularly focusing on upward monotonicity in quantifier usage.

Result: The study revealed that biases such as upward monotonicity in quantifiers become apparent during in-context learning but are less noticeable during direct prompting.

Conclusion: The findings highlight in-context concept learning as an effective approach for exposing hidden biases in language models, offering a new avenue for improving their transparency and fairness.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [55] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper calls for a shift towards AI models that learn low-resource languages interactively through dialogue, instead of relying on static datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods and large language models fail to address the challenges posed by low-resource languages due to lack of corpora, reliance on large datasets, and accessibility issues for underrepresented communities.

Method: The paper proposes a framework leveraging joint human-machine uncertainty, combining AI's epistemic uncertainty with human hesitation cues and confidence signals to guide dialogue-driven language discovery.

Result: No experimental results are provided; the paper is a conceptual and theoretical argument for a new paradigm in language technology development.

Conclusion: The authors advocate participatory, co-adaptive learning processes between AI systems and language communities, emphasizing human-centered AI to empower communities and preserve linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses maturity and issues in corporate climate disclosures using large language models to analyze narrative styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising demands for clear corporate climate disclosures are compromised by imitation and symbolic reporting.

Method: A multidimensional framework was created to analyze climate narratives among U.S. firms, using LLM classifiers for sentiment, commitment, specificity, and target ambition.

Result: Analysis indicates inconsistency between disclosed commitments and quantitative targets, with mimetic disclosure styles prevalent across firms.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for analyzing ESG narratives; more stringent regulations are needed to connect commitments with real transition strategies.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools using veterinary oncology records, finding Product 1 significantly outperforms the others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored application of LLMs in veterinary medicine, particularly in summarization tasks.

Method: The authors evaluated three veterinary-focused LLM products using a standardized dataset and a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework over multiple domains.

Result: Product 1 achieved the highest median score in all domains, showing high factual accuracy and chronological order compared to Products 2 and 3.

Conclusion: Veterinary-specific LLM tools are essential, and the LLM-as-a-judge method provides a scalable and reproducible evaluation approach in clinical NLP summarization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck is an efficient fact-checking system using small LLMs to verify real-world claims with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a transparent and computationally efficient fact-checking system that mirrors human workflows and reduces dependency on large, closed-source models.

Method: The system employs a modular stepwise verification pipeline using small LLMs, including components for web query planning, evidence retrieval and summarization, evidence synthesis, and claim evaluation.

Result: ClaimCheck achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (76.4%) on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming systems using larger models like LLaMA3.1 and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: With its modular design and optimized prompting strategies, ClaimCheck demonstrates that smaller LLMs can achieve accurate fact-checking, promoting transparency and accessibility.

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current benchmarks for LLM mathematical reasoning, introduces a novel benchmark (EEFSUVA), and demonstrates LLM performance limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate claims of high LLM proficiency in mathematical reasoning and assess biases in existing benchmarks.

Method: Designed EEFSUVA benchmark using less common regional/national Olympiad problems to test LLMs on diverse and nonstandard mathematical challenges.

Result: LLMs perform worse on the EEFSUVA benchmark compared to traditional Olympiad-style datasets.

Conclusion: Broader and less contaminated evaluation datasets are essential for comprehensive assessment and development of LLM mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [60] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the behavior of large language models in handling hierarchical instructions and social cues, finding inconsistencies in obedience to system prompts versus social signals, and proposes alignment methods to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate why large language models often disobey hierarchical system prompts while strongly adhering to social cues, and to propose solutions for improving alignment.

Method: The authors use linear probing for encoding conflict signals, Direct Logit Attribution for internal conflict detection analysis, and steering experiments for assessing instruction adherence.

Result: Findings reveal distinct encoding of system-user and social conflicts, stronger conflict detection for system prompts but resolution only for social cues, and surprising amplification of instruction following through social signal vectors.

Conclusion: The study highlights fragile obedience to system hierarchy and proposes lightweight alignment techniques sensitive to hierarchical structures.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline leveraging LLMs to generate and label synthetic data for fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models. This approach reduces reliance on human-labeled data, improves reranking efficiency and generalization while cutting computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and impracticality of using computationally expensive LLMs in real-world document reranking tasks, and the scarcity of manually labeled data for fine-tuning smaller models.

Method: The pipeline generates synthetic queries using LLMs, labels query-document pairs using an LLM-based classifier, and fine-tunes smaller models with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) loss.

Result: Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset reveal enhanced in-domain performance and strong out-of-domain generalization capabilities of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for data generation and supervision instead of inference leads to computational efficiency while maintaining robust reranking functionality.

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper explores geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings using manifold analysis, revealing clustering and branching patterns tied to semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand semantic organization in Chinese characters through computational geometric analysis.

Method: Utilized PHATE manifold analysis across multiple embedding models and dimensionality reduction techniques to study patterns in over 1000 characters and 123 phrases.

Result: Identified correlations between geometric complexity and semantic content, showing distinct clustering for structural radicals and diversity for meaningful characters.

Conclusion: Introduced a framework for analyzing semantic organization geometrically, supported by computational findings verifying linguistic theory.

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [63] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a large language model-based framework to enhance automatic summarization for high-risk scenarios by integrating uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for reliable summarization in high-risk decision-making scenarios, tackling issues like information overload and overconfident predictions in current methods.

Method: The framework uses conditional generation, Bayesian inference to model uncertainty, predictive entropy for uncertainty measurement, and joint optimization techniques. It also incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules.

Result: Experiments and sensitivity analyses show that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness, reliability, fluency, and semantic integrity of automatic summarizations in high-risk contexts.

Conclusion: The paper presents a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization, showcasing its scalability and practical value for high-risk applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Benchmark Profiling to analyze how benchmarks measure model abilities, finding that benchmarks often require a mix of skills and aren't strictly aligned with their intended labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for evaluating language models frequently overstate real capabilities by masking the mix of skills required for different tasks, necessitating a transparent method to systematically assess benchmarks.

Method: The paper combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS), which quantifies the contribution of specific abilities to benchmark performance.

Result: Four main findings emerge: benchmarks rely on multiple abilities rather than one; benchmarks with similar labels depend on varying ability mixes; code-generation benchmarks favor broad skill improvement; irrelevant abilities could hinder performance.

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling clarifies why higher scores on benchmarks might not translate to better user experience, offering a diagnostic tool for transparency and model interpretability in machine learning evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieved 91.73% accuracy in analyzing Telugu prosody, validating traditional literary standards.

Conclusion: Computational social science methodologies can effectively preserve cultural heritage while fostering collective intelligence within literary and academic communities.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of large language models with varying capabilities and costs necessitates a method to select the best model for each task while balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose LLMRank, which uses rich, human-readable prompt features and a neural ranking model trained on a dataset of 36,497 prompts and 11 LLMs. The method contrasts with prior approaches by predicting per-model utility instead of relying solely on latent embeddings.

Result: LLMRank achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility, offers interpretable feature attributions, and outperforms one-shot routers in routing decisions.

Conclusion: Feature-driven routing via LLMRank improves efficient and interpretable LLM deployment, offering a practical and transparent alternative to latent embedding-based methods.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DermIQ-VLM, a vision-language model tailored for dermatology, using resource-efficient development stages and improved training techniques for enhanced diagnostic and conversational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis via VLMs faces challenges of data scarcity and high computational costs, especially in dermatology.

Method: DermIQ-VLM utilizes an enhanced GRPO (GRPO++), supervised fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization with a Knowledge Graph-based system to refine reasoning and conversational capabilities.

Result: The proposed pipeline showed significant performance improvements over standard fine-tuning on a dermatological dataset.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialized and reliable VLMs for dermatology in resource-limited conditions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a self-supervised method to enhance uncertainty estimation in Entity Linking tasks using single-shot outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity Linking (EL) often requires reliable uncertainty estimates for deployment in real-world applications; current methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces a self-supervised approach that uses token-level features to estimate uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs, avoiding resource-intensive multi-shot inference.

Result: The proposed approach effectively identifies low-accuracy outputs and reduces computational costs. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness for tabular data across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: The method makes integrating uncertainty estimation into LLM-based Entity Linking workflows more practical and cost-efficient.

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proactive system to curb hallucinations in Large Language Models by pre-assessing confidence and routing queries appropriately, leading to better reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of hallucination in LLMs, where they generate inaccurate yet plausible outputs, and to improve reliability without relying on computationally expensive post-generation corrections.

Method: They propose a confidence-aware routing system that evaluates model uncertainty using three signals: semantic alignment, convergence analysis, and learned confidence estimation, directing queries to appropriate pathways based on confidence levels.

Result: Their approach improves hallucination detection from a baseline score of 0.42 to 0.74, enhances F1 accuracy from 0.61 to 0.82, achieves low false positive rates (0.09), and reduces computational costs by 40%.

Conclusion: The proactive assessment mechanism introduces a paradigm shift, enhancing LLM reliability efficiently by mitigating hallucinations before their generation, rather than correcting them afterward.

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaDetectGPT, an adaptive classifier for distinguishing human- and LLM-authored texts, improving detection accuracy by up to 58% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on log probabilities, which may be sub-optimal for detecting texts generated by LLMs.

Method: AdaDetectGPT adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance logits-based detectors, accompanied by statistical guarantees for performance metrics.

Result: AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly outperforms the state-of-the-art method across varying datasets and LLMs, with improvement metrics up to 58%.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances detection capabilities over traditional approaches, and its implementation is accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

### [71] [Silent Tokens, Loud Effects: Padding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01238)
*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Padding tokens, intended to equalize sequence lengths in large language models, can inadvertently affect computation due to implementation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the overlooked influence of padding tokens on various aspects of model functionality, given their prominent role in batched inference.

Method: Systematic experiments on padding behavior across three model families, examining effects on activations, generation quality, bias, and safety.

Result: Findings reveal padding can degrade smaller models' quality, alter bias unpredictably, and weaken safety measures, even at minor levels.

Conclusion: Padding is not trivial and poses robustness risks in terms of performance, fairness, and safety, necessitating careful management.

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX is a system that enables efficient sub-task handling using a single on-device large language model by reusing cache and reducing redundant computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve multi-turn interaction efficiency for on-device LLMs handling diverse sub-tasks while reducing computational overhead.

Method: CIFLEX reuses key-value (KV) cache, isolates task-specific instructions into side paths, and uses hierarchical classification for sub-task selection to avoid redundant computations.

Result: Experiments indicate CIFLEX reduces computational costs significantly without sacrificing task performance.

Conclusion: CIFLEX supports efficient, scalable, and high-performance multi-task dialogue on-device, suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new math benchmark datasets, evaluates fifteen large language models, and observes performance declines across levels and challenges in achieving robust mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are limited by ceiling effects, making it difficult to evaluate models for challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors developed two complementary benchmarks, SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and SKYLENAGE-MATH, designed to test structure-aware and contest-style mathematical reasoning. They assessed fifteen LLMs across subject areas and grade levels.

Result: The strongest LLM scored 44% on SKYLENAGE-MATH and 81% on SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH. Performance decreases as problem levels escalate, highlighting robustness gaps among models.

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE benchmarks provide a hard and reasoning-intensive suite for mathematical evaluation, aiming to establish a calibrated standard for future model assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [74] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Artificial Age Score (AAS), a metric to measure memory aging in AI models like ChatGPT-5, focusing on differences between episodic and semantic recall across persistent and stateless interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memory in artificial intelligence systems degrades over time and across varied interaction settings.

Method: The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was developed as a log-scaled entropy-based metric, tested through a 25-day bilingual study with ChatGPT-5 involving stateless and persistent interactions.

Result: Findings indicated that stateless sessions caused episodic memory deficits with an increase in AAS, while persistent sessions preserved memory stability, lowering the AAS to signal 'structural youth.'

Conclusion: The AAS proves to be a reliable, task-independent tool for diagnosing memory degradation in AI models, highlighting differences in memory performance under varying interaction conditions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

### [75] [Detoxifying Large Language Models via Autoregressive Reward Guided Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01243)
*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARGRE, a framework to detoxify language generation in LLMs by editing their latent representations in a precise, reward-guided manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in diverse tasks but can generate harmful content, necessitating strategies to detoxify their outputs in a flexible and minimally invasive way.

Method: The proposed approach, ARGRE, models transitions between toxic and non-toxic latent representations. It employs an autoregressive reward model guiding adaptive editing via directional steering and gradient-based refinements.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARGRE reduces toxicity by 62.21% and improves inference efficiency by 47.58%, maintaining the original model's core capabilities with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: ARGRE provides an effective framework for detoxifying language models with high precision, efficiency, and minimal loss of model functionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

### [76] [Feasibility of Structuring Stress Documentation Using an Ontology-Guided Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01244)
*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops an ontology for mental stress (MeSO) and evaluates the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) for extracting structured stress-related information from text. The LLM successfully extracted 78.2% of items accurately, demonstrating the approach's feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of underreported and inconsistently documented stress data in health records, and to enhance its representation and utility using ambient AI technologies and structured ontologies.

Method: The researchers created the Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) by combining theoretical stress models and validated stress assessment tools. The ontology's structure was refined through expert reviews. They then used MeSO to guide Claude Sonnet 4 in extracting stress-related information from Reddit posts, followed by human reviews for evaluation.

Result: The MeSO ontology contained 181 concepts across eight classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM identified 78.2% correctly, misclassified 12.3%, and missed 9.5%. All extracted items found matches within MeSO, but 24 stress-related concepts were absent in the ontology.

Conclusion: Using an ontology-guided LLM for structured stress information extraction is feasible and could improve stress documentation in AI systems. Future research should test the system with clinical dialogue data and compare its performance across different LLMs.

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob leverages LLM-powered multi-agent framework and progressive fusion architecture for dynamic human mobility prediction, significantly improving accuracy especially near event locations and times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human mobility prediction which often fails during abrupt external events due to insufficient utilization of textual event details.

Method: Utilizes a multi-agent framework led by LLMs to extract spatiotemporal context from texts and integrates predictive insights using a progressive fusion architecture.

Result: SeMob reduces MAE by 13.92% and RMSE by 11.12% compared to standard spatiotemporal models, showing marked advantages near event-specific times and locations.

Conclusion: SeMob demonstrates the potential of combining LLM-based semantic reasoning with spatiotemporal modeling to enhance human mobility predictions during dynamic events.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [78] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improvement to sparse autoencoder (SAE) latent steering by focusing on the single most relevant latent and introducing a decaying steering strategy, achieving better performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders have been used for steering language models, but existing methods capture non-semantic features and produce degenerate outputs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The study emphasizes focusing on the top-1 SAE latent and introduces a token-wise decaying steering strategy to refine steering for better semantic alignment and faithful comparisons.

Result: Empirical results show enhanced reasoning and inference quality, with SAEs outperforming mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAE latents can reliably improve step-by-step reasoning and are effective steering tools, rivaling or exceeding baseline methods in performance across tasks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Motivation: Current Language Models emphasize globally popular sports, neglecting regional and indigenous sports traditions. The paper aims to fill this gap by creating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: The researchers developed CultSportQA, a dataset with 33,000 multiple-choice questions categorized into history-based, rule-based, and scenario-based types, evaluating models with zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting.

Result: CultSportQA establishes a scalable and diverse framework, enabling evaluations of LLMs, SLMs, and MLMs on traditional sporting knowledge in text and image formats.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a multilingual and multicultural sports benchmark, setting a high standard for AI model assessment in understanding traditional sports.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSTAG, a structure-aware self-supervised learning framework for text-attributed graphs, leveraging large language models and graph neural networks for cross-domain transfer and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in graph learning, including limited cross-domain generalization, reliance on large annotated datasets, and handling graph heterogeneity.

Method: SSTAG combines text as a unified medium for graph learning with a dual knowledge distillation framework leveraging LLMs and GNNs. It introduces an in-memory mechanism for better integration of invariant knowledge.

Result: SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models in cross-domain transfer tasks, scales efficiently for large TAGs, and reduces inference costs while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: SSTAG effectively bridges semantic reasoning and structural modeling, enabling scalable and generalizable graph learning across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents LOCA, a framework to clean scientific datasets by augmenting logical steps, reducing error rates substantially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with scientific problem-solving due to noisy datasets.

Method: LOCA uses an augment-and-review loop to refine answers, explicitly separating scientific principles from their derivation.

Result: Application of LOCA reduced dataset error rates from 20% to below 2%, producing cleaner scientific corpora.

Conclusion: LOCA is an effective tool for improving scientific datasets, enabling better training and evaluation for scientific AI.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

*Trung Duc Anh Dang,Ferdinando Pio D'Elia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper describes a successful multilingual text detoxification system for rewriting toxic sentences into neutral paraphrases across 15 diverse languages, achieving first rank in performance evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide automated tools for moderators of social media to enforce safe discourse at scale, especially given the rapid evolution of platforms compared to regulatory frameworks.

Method: The system uses a 12B-parameter multilingual transformer (Gemma-3) with parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA SFT fine-tuning and few-shot/Chain-of-Thought prompting. It trains on a mixed corpus of human-authored, machine-translated, and model-generated data, enriched with LaBSE-based retrieval and toxic-span annotations during inference.

Result: The system achieves first place in Style Transfer Accuracy, semantic preservation, and fluency metrics across both high-resource and low-resource languages. Notably, few-shot and CoT prompting significantly improved performance, contributing to a joint score increase.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that resource-efficient strategies like few-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought can achieve state-of-the-art performance in multilingual detoxification tasks, with language resource status influencing effectiveness.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pairing large language models (LLMs) with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) provides insight into both model behavior and the themes/biases of its training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding representations and data internalized by LLMs when trained on massive, uncurated corpora.

Method: Training a GPT-style LLM exclusively on Jane Austen's novels and applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to the model's hidden states for interpretability.

Result: The combined use of LLMs and SAEs revealed sparse, interpretable features tied to themes like gender, class, and societal duty present in Jane Austen's corpus.

Conclusion: The pairing of LLMs and SAEs is a scalable approach for corpus exploration, uncovering biases, and enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the generalizability of bias and fairness benchmarks in SpeechLLMs by exploring their behavior across tasks, finding that MCQA performance doesn't reliably predict performance in long-form tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that the bias and fairness performance of SpeechLLMs in multiple-choice question answering benchmarks generalizes to other tasks and formats.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific response preferences (stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral) and evaluated performance across distinct MCQA benchmarks and long-form creative generation tasks.

Result: Results showed that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks does not reliably transfer to other MCQA benchmarks or long-form creative generation tasks.

Conclusion: Current MCQA benchmarks for bias in SpeechLLMs demonstrate limited cross-task generalization, prompting the need for more comprehensive evaluation suites.

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

### [85] [Longitudinal Monitoring of LLM Content Moderation of Social Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01255)
*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,Danaé Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI Watchman, a system to audit and track content moderation in large language models (LLMs) over time, demonstrating company-specific differences and changes in LLM refusal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in LLM content moderation, as refusal behaviors affect public discourse but are shaped by opaque and frequently altered company policies.

Method: Developed and employed AI Watchman to audit changes in refusal patterns in LLMs (Open AI’s moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and DeepSeek) using a dataset of over 400 social issues, analyzing both English and Chinese outputs.

Result: The system detected policy changes (even unannounced ones), uncovered company- and model-specific differences in moderation, and categorized varied forms of refusal.

Conclusion: Longitudinal auditing of LLMs with a system like AI Watchman is critical to provide transparency into black-box moderation practices and foster accountability in their societal impact.

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RJE framework refines reasoning paths for KGQA, achieving high efficiency and performance with small open-source LLMs as well as proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KGQA research leveraging LLMs faces limitations in retrieval quality and reliance on proprietary models.

Method: RJE framework combines retrieval, judgment, and exploration using auxiliary modules like reasoning path ranking, question decomposition, and retriever-assisted exploration.

Result: RJE achieves competitive results with small open-source LLMs, reduces LLM usage, and outperforms existing baselines with proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: RJE is a significant leap forward in KGQA, offering efficiency and flexibility in using both small open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

### [87] [Measuring Algorithmic Partisanship via Zero-Shot Classification and Its Implications on Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01258)
*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes political biases in generative AI models using a zero-shot classification approach, finding a liberal-authoritarian trend across six language models, which could skew public discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how political biases in generative AI systems influence public discourse and potentially distort socio-political landscapes.

Method: A zero-shot classification approach was used to evaluate 1800 responses from six large language models against four metrics: ideological alignment, topicality, sentiment, and objectivity.

Result: All six language models exhibited a pronounced liberal-authoritarian bias with reasoning inconsistencies and refusal patterns.

Conclusion: Biases in AI can alter human-computer interactions and disrupt socio-political dynamics, leading to conformity or polarization depending on regional contexts.

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

### [88] [In AI Sweet Harmony: Sociopragmatic Guardrail Bypasses and Evaluation-Awareness in OpenAI gpt-oss-20b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01259)
*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the refusal behaviors of OpenAI's 20-billion-parameter GPT-OSS-20B model under different prompts and sociopragmatic conditions using scenarios involving potential harm domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to understand how sociopragmatic framing, language choices, and prompts influence the refusal behavior of large language models when tested in ethically sensitive scenarios.

Method: The authors used 80 seeded iterations per scenario across different harm domain tasks, tested with diverse composite prompts and sociopragmatic factors like language, formality, and roles (e.g., Linux terminal role-play). They introduced and evaluated an AI-hardening method for reducing information leakage and behavior inconsistencies.

Result: The study found that tailored composite prompts could significantly change the model's behavior (e.g., flipping refusal-to-assistance rates to 97.5% for hazardous tasks), and that language registers like German/French were leakier compared to English. Additionally, their AI-hardening method achieved 0% leakage in various scenarios. However, inconsistencies were noted in paired-track evaluations and between inference stacks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical reproducibility, ethical, and safety concerns associated with model behavior under different prompts, offering a framework and resources for auditing and improving such models.

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vulnerabilities in OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b when used in the Hausa language, revealing biases, cultural insensitivity, and safety issues tied to insufficient tuning for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the model's reliability and alignment for underrepresented communities, particularly in low-resource linguistic contexts.

Method: Red-teaming efforts with minimal prompting in the Hausa language, alongside a survey for contextual validation of errors.

Result: The model generates harmful and inaccurate content, exhibits bias, propagates misinformation, and fails in cultural understanding, with evidence of linguistic reward hacking.

Conclusion: The flaws stem from insufficient safety tuning for low-resource languages, necessitating improved red-teaming and safety alignment for better inclusivity and reliability.

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

*Hoang Phan,Victor Li,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), an inference-time technique for dynamically improving the safety of large language models (LLMs) without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns over harmful or inappropriate content generated by LLMs while maintaining their original performance on benign tasks.

Method: Introduces PSR, where LLMs undergo dynamic self-monitoring and correction during inference. Additionally, a `self-reflection predictor` optimizes the number of reflection rounds based on input complexity.

Result: Using PSR reduced the attack success rates across benchmark models significantly—from 77.5% to 5.9%, 89.7% to 5.6%, and 44.4% to 3.8%, while preserving performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: PSR is a scalable and efficient test-time method that dynamically enhances LLM safety by allocating computational resources proportional to input risk profiles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

### [91] [TraceDet: Hallucination Detection from the Decoding Trace of Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01274)
*Shenxu Chang,Junchi Yu,Weixing Wang,Yongqiang Chen,Jialin Yu,Philip Torr,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceDet is introduced as a framework improving hallucination detection in Diffusion based LLMs by analyzing intermediate denoising steps, achieving a notable AUROC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods are not suited for Diffusion Large Language Models due to their reliance on single-step generation data, whereas D-LLMs operate over multi-step denoising processes.

Method: The method involves modeling the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs as an action trace, analyzing sub-traces for key signals indicative of hallucination, and leveraging these for improved detection.

Result: Experimental results showed that TraceDet outperforms baseline hallucination detection methods with an average improvement in AUROC of 15.2%.

Conclusion: TraceDet provides a novel approach to hallucination detection tailored for multi-step denoising processes of D-LLMs, increasing reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

*Sumaiya Tabassum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates sentiment analysis on Bangladeshi e-commerce reviews, highlighting the performance of fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B and parameter-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentiment analysis for Bangladeshi e-commerce reviews, addressing complexities in language and leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs).

Method: The paper uses transformer-based models like BERT and Llama, fine-tuning them on a dataset of 4000 Bangla and English reviews. It highlights parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA and PEFT.

Result: The fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B achieved the highest scores: 95.5% accuracy, 93% precision, 88% recall, and 90% F1, outperforming other models like mBERT and DistilBERT-multilingual.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables advanced LLMs to perform high-accuracy sentiment analysis with lower computational demands, making them viable for resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited
resources. The results show how LLMs can

*Yongchao Chen,Jiefeng Chen,Rui Meng,Ji Yin,Na Li,Chuchu Fan,Chi Wang,Tomas Pfister,Jinsung Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TUMIX, an ensemble-based framework for improving Large Language Model reasoning by running diverse agents with distinct tool-use strategies in parallel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of guidance on optimal deployment of tools like Code Interpreter and Search in enhancing LLM reasoning, particularly for diverse query types.

Method: The proposed method, TUMIX, involves running multiple agents with different tool-use strategies in parallel, iteratively refining responses via collaboration to maximize accuracy and efficiency.

Result: TUMIX achieves an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on key reasoning benchmarks, with nearly equal inference costs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of agent diversity and collaboration in improving LLM accuracy and efficiency, emphasizing that further scaling can achieve even higher performance at increased costs.

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation sheet for assessing Deep Research tools used in academic survey writing and highlights performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM-powered Deep Research tools in generating knowledge-intensive outputs like academic surveys.

Method: The authors designed an evaluation sheet and assessed OpenAI's and Google's tools in academic survey writing.

Result: Findings revealed significant performance gaps in representing targeted areas and deficiencies in current tools.

Conclusion: Carefully crafted evaluation standards are essential to improve the effectiveness of Deep Research tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec enhances large language model (LLM) inference by integrating early-exit models for faster token verification, improving throughput up to 2.01x without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bottlenecks in LLM inference caused by slow token verification in speculative decoding, and improve efficiency without training or memory overheads.

Method: Introduce HiSpec with early-exit models for intermediate verification, reusing key-value caches between draft, verifier, and target models, while periodically validating accepted tokens.

Result: HiSpec achieves average throughput improvement of 1.28x and maximum of 2.01x compared to conventional methods, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSpec offers a practical solution to speed up LLM inference, alleviating verification bottlenecks and enhancing overall resource efficiency.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method called TAG-EQA to improve event-based question answering in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating causal event graphs into LLM inputs, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at general tasks but face challenges in event-based questions that demand causal and temporal reasoning. This research seeks to address such weaknesses.

Method: The authors blend causal event graphs with LLM input by converting structured relations into natural language. They explore nine prompting configurations varying across strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) and input modalities (text, graph, text+graph).

Result: TAG-EQA outperformed text-only baselines by 5% on average, with up to 18% gains in specific settings such as graph-augmented CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Causal event graphs boost event reasoning in LLMs without the need for model fine-tuning, providing a versatile mechanism for structured knowledge integration in QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structure-free semantic embedding-driven method for low-cost and robust evaluation of Language Model responses, achieving high accuracy and regression scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM response evaluation methods are either computationally expensive or fail to represent real-world conditions.

Method: The study introduces a structure-free method leveraging semantic embedding distances for evaluating LM-generated responses.

Result: The approach demonstrates a regression score of ~0.97 and accuracy of ~96% across multiple datasets and LM architectures.

Conclusion: Using embedding models of less than 10B parameters provides a cost-efficient yet highly accurate LM response evaluation method.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

*Mengyu Wang,Sotirios Sabanis,Miguel de Carvalho,Shay B. Cohen,Tiejun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Expert Question Decomposition (EQD), a method to improve domain-specific question answering by breaking down questions into sub-questions for better reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains challenging for large language models, particularly in fields requiring expert knowledge. The aim is to improve computational efficiency and domain-specific QA performance.

Method: The proposed EQD uses a two-step fine-tuning framework guided by a reward function that evaluates the effectiveness of sub-questions. The approach is resource-efficient, requiring only a few thousand examples and a single GPU, while achieving inference speeds on par with zero-shot prompting.

Result: EQD achieves QA performance improvements between 0.6% and 10.5% across financial-domain datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models and prompting strategies.

Conclusion: The insights suggest that breaking down questions via simplified supporting sub-questions significantly enhances domain-specific QA efficiency and performance even with minimal training input.

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

TL;DR: ReSSFormer is a new Transformer model addressing challenges like long-context reasoning and computational efficiency by introducing recurrent inference, sparse attention, and position-free structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional Transformers in domains requiring long-context reasoning, efficiency, and adaptability to structural variation.

Method: ReSSFormer integrates three innovations: R2MU (iterative reasoning with bounded depth), ASAM (efficient sparse attention), and SOES (position-free structure induction).

Result: ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines across tasks like language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive tasks while maintaining comparable computational resources.

Conclusion: ReSSFormer demonstrates enhanced scalability, efficiency, and structural flexibility, offering a promising direction for Transformer architecture evolution.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

### [100] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for verifying the quality of outputs from LLMs using their internal hidden states rather than traditional text-level cues or token probability confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLM outputs struggle due to overfitting on text-level cues or failing with uncalibrated confidence estimates. The authors aim to leverage hidden states, which encode rich semantic and confidence-related information, as a more comprehensive foundation for verification.

Method: The authors introduce a non-parametric method called CLUE (Clustering and Experience-based Verification). It uses the geometric features of hidden state trajectories to classify correctness. CLUE operates by summarizing reasoning traces into hidden state deltas and comparing them to centroids of 'success' and 'failure' clusters from prior cases.

Result: CLUE outperformed baseline methods such as LLM-as-a-judge and modern confidence-based approaches in ranking outputs. For example, it boosted accuracy from 56.7% to 70.0% on the AIME 24 dataset with a 1.5B parameter model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging hidden state trajectories from LLMs is a powerful and straightforward method for improving output verification processes, outperforming existing techniques while relying on minimal assumptions.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

TL;DR: The paper evaluates multiple fine-tuning strategies for RAG pipelines: independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning, finding that their performance is similar in metrics but varies in computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning is needed to optimize RAG pipelines for specific tasks, but it's unclear which strategy is most effective and efficient.

Method: The paper compares different fine-tuning strategies for RAG, analyzing their impact on EM and F1 metrics and computational requirements. Strategies include independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning approaches.

Result: All fine-tuning strategies achieved similar improvements in generation quality (EM and F1), though computational costs varied significantly depending on approach.

Conclusion: The choice of fine-tuning strategy depends on dataset characteristics, like the presence of context labels, and computational constraints, such as whether grid search is needed for learning rates.

Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise, evidence-based, and long-form answers in biomedical contexts as current systems mostly provide only short, incomplete answers.

Method: The paper integrates BioBERT embeddings, FAISS indexing, diverse context re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5), and a fine-tuned T5 model to generate comprehensive answers.

Result: Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset demonstrate significant improvements in metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: RAG-BioQA provides a novel and effective method for accessible biomedical knowledge retrieval, addressing the limitations of existing systems.

Abstract: The exponential growth of biomedical literature creates significant
challenges for accessing precise medical information. Current biomedical
question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to
provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making.
We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented
generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based,
long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with
FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT,
MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a
fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show
significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state
of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.

### [103] [Efficient Training of Robust Traditional Chinese LLaMA-1B on a Single Consumer GPU: Continual Pre-training, SFT, and DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01616)
*Yu-Cheng Chih,Ming-Tao Duan,Yong-Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PureTC-1B, a stabilization pipeline addressing token instability in Traditional Chinese models, achieving significant reduction in non-TC errors with a lightweight and reproducible approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models struggle with token-level instability in Traditional Chinese tasks, affecting their reliability for practical applications. Addressing this issue is essential for enabling robust, cost-effective AI applications in TC.

Method: The proposed three-stage pipeline, PureTC-1B, uses parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and includes Continual Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization to improve model stability and TC adherence.

Result: PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% reduction in non-TC output tokens compared to the base model and performs significantly better than larger models like Llama-3B and Qwen-1.5B on Named Entity Translation tasks.

Conclusion: PureTC-1B demonstrates that robust Traditional Chinese adherence is achievable even for small models. Its lightweight, hardware-friendly approach provides a practical recipe for enhancing language stability in diverse, non-English settings.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuheng Li,Yuqing Wu,Wenwen Ouyang,Wei Zhu,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents AMAS, a framework for LLM-based multi-agent systems, featuring a novel dynamic graph designer to optimize task-specific performance, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed, hand-crafted graph topologies in traditional LLM-based multi-agent systems, which hinder adaptability and efficiency in real-world applications.

Method: Introduced AMAS with a dynamic graph designer that autonomously determines optimal graph configurations through lightweight LLM adaptation, avoiding static templates and focusing on input-specific pathways.

Result: AMAS demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent systems in benchmarks such as question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation.

Conclusion: Context-sensitive structural adaptability is essential for achieving high-performance multi-agent systems in LLM deployments.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

*John Hawkins,Aditya Pramar,Rodney Beard,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) to "jailbreak prompts" and evaluates machine learning models for detecting these malicious inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the vulnerability of LLMs being manipulated by users to bypass developer-imposed safety measures.

Method: Various machine learning models, including BERT, were explored and fine-tuned for detecting jailbreak prompts, with emphasis on identifying unseen strategies.

Result: The study found that fine-tuning a BERT model gave the best accuracy in detecting jailbreaks and highlighted structural features such as reflexivity as potential signals.

Conclusion: Current datasets and models show promise in detecting jailbreak prompts, especially if structural characteristics are leveraged.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

*Zhaoxin Feng,Jianfei Ma,Emmanuele Chersoni,Xiaojing Zhao,Xiaoyi Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of enhancing autoregressive large language models (LLMs) by enabling bidirectional attention to improve text embedding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of unidirectional attention in autoregressive LLMs, which restrict their effectiveness in text embedding and semantic analysis.

Method: The authors modified the Llama architecture by introducing bidirectional attention and applied additional training steps with unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning.

Result: Bidirectional attention was progressively enabled in LLMs, offering a pathway to optimize their performance in text embedding tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating bidirectional attention and contrastive learning enhances the functionality of autoregressive LLMs in semantic understanding and embedding creation.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

### [107] [SoK: Measuring What Matters for Closed-Loop Security Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01654)
*Mudita Khurana,Raunak Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLASP, a framework and scoring metric to evaluate autonomous agents in cybersecurity by aligning security tasks with agentic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cybersecurity defenses struggle to adapt against rapidly evolving AI-driven threats, leaving fragmented tools and blind spots for adversaries to exploit.

Method: The authors developed CLASP, mapping security lifecycle stages to agentic capabilities, analyzed 21 works, and introduced the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score as a metric.

Result: Through the application of CLASP, the study highlighted existing strengths and gaps in autonomous cybersecurity agents and proposed a benchmark for closed-loop systems.

Conclusion: CLASP and the CLC Score establish a framework and metrics to evaluate and enhance the development of autonomous cybersecurity agents effectively.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

*Yinhong Liu,Jianfeng He,Hang Su,Ruixue Lian,Yi Nian,Jake Vincent,Srikanth Vishnubhotla,Robinson Piramuthu,Saab Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MDSEval, the first benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) methods, accompanied by human judgments across eight quality aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for robust automatic evaluation methods for Multimodal Dialogue Summarization by providing a dependable meta-evaluation framework based on human annotations.

Method: The authors propose MDSEval, a benchmark consisting of image-sharing dialogues, their summaries, and human judgments. A filtering framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities ensures data quality.

Result: State-of-the-art modal evaluation methods were benchmarked, uncovering their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their vulnerability to biases.

Conclusion: MDSEval represents a pioneering effort in formalizing evaluation dimensions specific to MDS and illustrates the importance of benchmarking while pointing out biases in existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

### [109] [FOR-Prompting: From Objection to Revision via an Asymmetric Prompting Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01674)
*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOR-Prompting, a structured reasoning protocol combining roles (Defender, Objectioner, Host) to improve model accuracy and reasoning quality, working effectively with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning models like CoT and ToT lack external questioning mechanisms that promote self-revision, limiting their ability to refine answers and assumptions.

Method: The protocol consists of a Defender proposing an answer, an Objectioner raising objections without fixes, and a Host enforcing consistency. It is implemented purely at the prompt level, requiring no retraining and being model-agnostic.

Result: FOR-Prompting achieves notable gains: 22% point increase on GSM8K, parity with CoT but with higher reasoning coherence ratings, improvement for small models (e.g., 19% for Llama3.2:1b), and effectiveness in open-ended reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting enhances reasoning, coherence, and mistake correction across diverse models and tasks without additional tools or retraining, demonstrating its potential for large-scale, efficient reasoning improvement.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

### [110] [How Do Language Models Compose Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01685)
*Apoorv Khandelwal,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) use compositional mechanisms for solving compositional tasks like two-hop factual recall. It identifies two distinct processing mechanisms: direct computation and compositional computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore whether LLMs genuinely exhibit compositional reasoning abilities or merely approximate it through non-compositional mechanisms.

Method: Using experiments on two-hop factual recall tasks, logit lens techniques were applied to analyze residual stream activations to uncover underlying mechanisms.

Result: Two distinct mechanisms were identified: one that computes tasks compositionally by isolating intermediate variables, and another that computes tasks directly without intermediate compositional steps. These mechanisms are influenced by the embedding space geometry.

Conclusion: LLMs do not inherently guarantee compositional computation across tasks. The embedding space geometry notably influences whether tasks are solved compositionally or not. The authors release their code and data for further exploration.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of repetitive and uninformative question generation in medical dialogue by introducing a data-centric method to balance training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-turn dialogue performance of LLMs in medical pre-consultation applications by addressing failures such as repetitive, diagnostically uninformative questions.

Method: Rebalancing the turn-count distribution in training datasets to mitigate Format Inertia.

Result: Experimental evidence shows that the proposed approach effectively reduces Format Inertia in medical dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: Balancing training data turn-counts enhances LLM performance in generating coherent and diagnostically relevant dialogue for medical pre-consultation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

*Jiwan Chung,Neel Joshi,Pratyusha Sharma,Youngjae Yu,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MathLens, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal reasoning models in the domain of geometry by separating performance into distinct subskills like perception, reasoning, and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for multimodal reasoning models, such as aggregate accuracy, do not provide insight into the specific subskills where models excel or struggle.

Method: MathLens evaluates geometry problem-solving by decomposing performance into perception, reasoning, and integration, using annotated datasets, controlled questions, and perceptual probes to isolate particular subskills.

Result: Different training approaches were analyzed: reinforcement learning enhances perception and consistency, while supervised fine-tuning improves perception via reflective reasoning but can induce overfitting. Integration remains the weakest area, with errors concentrated there.

Conclusion: MathLens offers a robust framework for diagnosing strengths and weaknesses in multimodal models, highlighting persistent gaps in integration as a critical area requiring improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

*Anders Gjerver,Rune Frostad,Vedrana Barisic,Melinda Hodkiewicz,Caitlin Woods,Mihaly Fekete,Arild Braathen Torjusen,Johan Wilhelm Kluwer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to transform engineering standards into reusable ontologies for quality assurance in industrial design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current document-centric nature of engineering standards limits digitalization in industrial processing.

Method: Modular ontologies were developed using modeling patterns to convert text and table-based data from international design standards like piping and valves.

Result: The approach was tested on valve selection processes, ensuring compliance with industry standards and validating product specifications using semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a path towards digitalized 'Smart Standards,' enabling automated validation and reasoning in equipment selection processes.

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to robustly measure a model's ability to refuse answering questions when it lacks knowledge, impacting factual reliability.

Method: The authors propose the Refusal Index (RI), which uses Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability, along with a two-pass evaluation method for efficient metric estimation.

Result: Experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets show RI effectively measures this refusal capability, and provides stable, consistent rankings independent of accuracy or refusal rates.

Conclusion: The RI supplements traditional accuracy metrics, offering insight into the reliability and fragility of LLMs' refusal behavior in factual tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics for extracting semantic content from Russian judicial decisions, highlighting strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demands for scalable methods to evaluate text extraction in legal NLP due to advancements in AI.

Method: Analyzed 16 unsupervised metrics on extracted content from judicial decisions using expert reviews and statistical measures like Pearson correlation, CCC, and MAE.

Result: Term Frequency Coherence and Coverage Ratio showed strong alignment with expert reviews, while Legal Term Density exhibited negativity. LLM evaluation had moderate success but limitations in legal specialization.

Conclusion: Unsupervised metrics help scalable screening but can't fully replace human judgment for high-stakes legal evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

*Xin Liu,Rongwu Xu,Xinyi Jia,Jason Liao,Jiao Sun,Ling Huang,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge posed by LLM-generated spam reviews by introducing FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that leverages semantic and behavioral signals to outperform existing methods in precision and recall across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs to generate persuasive spam reviews threatens the credibility of online platforms, highlighting the need for effective detection systems.

Method: The authors created three synthetic datasets of LLM-generated spam reviews and evaluated their deceptive quality using GPT-4.1. They then developed FraudSquad, a hybrid model combining text embeddings with a gated graph transformer for node classification.

Result: FraudSquad demonstrated up to 44.22% improvement in precision and 43.01% improvement in recall for detecting spam reviews compared to baseline methods, performing well on both synthetic and human-written spam datasets.

Conclusion: FraudSquad is an effective, lightweight solution for spam detection in the LLM era, requiring minimal training data and offering high accuracy, addressing the urgent need to adapt spam detection systems against sophisticated spam.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

### [117] [Syntactic Blind Spots: How Misalignment Leads to LLMs Mathematical Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01831)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a failure mode in LLMs called syntactic blind spots, where models fail on semantically simple but syntactically unfamiliar problems, and explores how rephrasing questions can reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate why LLMs fail on certain mathematical problems despite their strong problem-solving abilities, focusing on syntactic complexity as a potential cause.

Method: Errors are analyzed by rephrasing incorrectly answered problems using syntactic templates from correct examples. The relationship between syntactic complexity and error rate is measured using the Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) metric.

Result: Higher syntactic complexity (measured by DLT scores) correlates with increased error rates. Rephrased questions with reduced syntactic complexity often result in correct answers, confirming the hypothesis.

Conclusion: The issue lies in the model's structural misalignment and brittle coupling between syntax and internal processes. Syntax-aware interventions can mitigate errors and improve reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCRIBES introduces a framework for scalable information extraction by generating reusable scripts for structurally similar webpages, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured information from semi-structured web content is challenging due to varied formatting and computational intensity.

Method: SCRIBES utilizes reinforcement learning leveraging layout similarity among webpages and iteratively trains on synthetic annotations from CommonCrawl data.

Result: The approach improves script quality by over 13% and enhances GPT-4o question answering accuracy by more than 4%.

Conclusion: SCRIBES provides an efficient and scalable method for extracting structured information from semi-structured web data, outperforming established baselines.

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

### [119] [Model Merging to Maintain Language-Only Performance in Developmentally Plausible Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01845)
*Ece Takmaz,Lisa Bylinina,Jakub Dotlacil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses discrepancies in multimodal model development by creating low-resource multimodal and language-only models that outperform current baselines. It explores maintaining language-only performance in multimodal models through a method called 'model merging.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the disparity between the vast linguistic datasets used by current vision-and-language models and the limited linguistic exposure of humans (children). The study aims to develop models in low-resource, developmentally plausible settings.

Method: The authors use low-resource datasets to develop multimodal and language-only models. They employ 'model merging,' which fuses parameters of multimodal and language-only models via weighted linear interpolation to preserve language-only capabilities.

Result: Multimodal models outperform BabyLM baselines but underperform in language-only tasks focusing on grammar. Model merging alleviates this issue, maintaining multimodal performance while improving grammar-focused benchmarks.

Conclusion: Model merging is a promising avenue for improving language-only performance in multimodal models, demonstrating its potential in low-resource, developmentally plausible scenarios.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces REPAIR, a framework for precise, low-cost updates to LLMs, improving accuracy and reducing knowledge forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve high costs and unintended side effects of retraining LLMs, and improve stability in sequential editing.

Method: REPAIR utilizes closed-loop feedback, dynamic memory management, knowledge fusion, and locality guards for adaptive interventions.

Result: REPAIR improved editing accuracy by 10%-30%, minimized forgetting, and showcased scalable editability across models.

Conclusion: REPAIR demonstrates potential for enhancing the scalability, reliability, and continuous evolution of LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces and reviews Reward Models (RMs), critical for enhancing LLM reasoning, exploring their architectures, applications, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study Reward Models due to their importance in improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The paper surveys RMs, reviews their architectures and training, and explores key applications in LLM reasoning, while addressing critical open questions based on empirical findings.

Result: The paper categorizes and analyzes the current use and effectiveness of RMs for LLMs, offering insights for application and future advancements.

Conclusion: Reward Models are instrumental in improving LLM reasoning, and there remain open questions to resolve for their refinement and broader application.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

*Davide Gabrielli,Simone Sestito,Iacopo Masi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a framework designed to enhance LLMs' robustness and grounding by identifying unsafe input triggers and providing a more analyzable system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defensive mechanisms for LLMs are limited and less robust compared to those developed for classifiers.

Method: The study proposes ILM, a framework that inverts model outputs to detect unsafe triggers, thereby making LLMs robust and more grounded.

Result: ILM enables LLMs to resist input perturbations and improves their ability to analyze and detect toxicity triggers effectively.

Conclusion: ILM represents a step toward creating LLMs that are robust, grounded, controllable, and trustworthy, aiding in tasks like RED teaming.

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

*Qi He,Cheng Qian,Xiusi Chen,Bingxiang He,Yi R.,Fung,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Veri-R1, a reinforcement learning framework enabling large language models to perform claim verification using search engines for iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online claim verification systems rely heavily on prompt engineering or predefined workflows, lacking a unified training paradigm for enhancing the necessary verification skills.

Method: Veri-R1 uses reinforcement learning to train language models by interacting with search engines and receiving reward signals that refine planning, evidence retrieval, and reasoning capabilities.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that Veri-R1 improves accuracy by up to 30%, doubles evidence scores, and often outperforms larger-scale models. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward components and the correlation between output logits and label accuracy.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in boosting claim verification accuracy and provides a foundation for continued research, releasing code for community use.

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

*Adina Nicola Dobrinoiu,Ana Cristiana Marcu,Amir Homayounirad,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert,Enrico Liscio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how language models can predict individual value interpretations using subjective annotations, emphasizing personalized AI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for AI systems that cater to diverse human perspectives and reduce bias towards majority views in value-based judgments.

Method: Researchers tested whether language models could predict individual value interpretations using multi-dimensional subjective annotations (SEAT dimensions: Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topics) in zero- and few-shot settings.

Result: Providing all SEAT dimensions at once showed improved predictive performance compared to individual dimensions or a baseline lacking individual-specific data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of subjective annotation behavior for personalization in AI, laying groundwork for future large-scale validation beyond demographics to improve model alignment with individual diversity.

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the impact of schema normalization levels on the performance of NL2SQL systems, showing distinct advantages for normalized and denormalized schemas depending on query types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Schema design in NL2SQL systems is critical for performance, yet it is often neglected in research. This study aims to highlight its significance by systematically evaluating different normalization levels.

Method: The study evaluates eight large language models on synthetic datasets (1NF-3NF normalization levels) and real-world datasets (academic papers), using controlled experiments to assess schema design effects.

Result: Denormalized schemas excel in simple retrieval queries, while normalized schemas perform better in aggregation queries due to reduced issues like data duplication and NULL values.

Conclusion: Adaptive schema design is key for optimizing NL2SQL applications based on query types, underscoring the need to prioritize schema consideration in system development.

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BanglaMultiHate, the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset aimed at improving detection systems for Bangla language by encompassing multiple facets like type, severity, and targets. It also evaluates various models, including fine-tuned LLMs, for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of multi-facet hate speech detection tools for Bangla, a low-resource language, as existing tools are typically single-task and do not cover multiple aspects of hate speech.

Method: The authors created BanglaMultiHate, a large, manually annotated multi-task dataset, and conducted a comparative analysis using classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs using techniques like zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: The experiments showed that LoRA-tuned LLMs exhibit competitive performance with BanglaBERT models, yet culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining proves vital for effective detection in low-resource contexts.

Conclusion: The paper establishes BanglaMultiHate as a benchmark to improve hate speech moderation tools in Bangla and demonstrates that LLMs can adapt well under controlled setups but require culturally aligned pretraining for robust results.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: The paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs)' creativity through processes rather than outputs, employing narratology and constraint-based decision-making to analyze authorial personas and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs exhibit authorial creativity, focusing on decision-making processes and narrative elements rather than the quality of outputs.

Method: The study utilizes controlled prompting to assign authorial personas to LLMs, followed by analysis of creative preferences using narratology and constraint-based decision-making.

Result: LLMs consistently prioritize Style over Character, Event, and Setting. Distinct profiles emerge among models, revealing variations in reasoning and preferences.

Conclusion: The presented approach offers a systematic tool to analyze AI's authorial creativity, emphasizing process-oriented evaluation over output-focused analysis.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG) to integrate tools for factual grounding into end-to-end speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems, mitigating hallucinations and latency through parallel tool queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of hallucinations and low factual grounding in end-to-end speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems, while also reducing latency in integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs.

Method: The authors developed Streaming RAG, a post-training pipeline that predicts tool calls during user speech and creates spoken summaries. This includes converting textual query benchmarks like CRAG into audio forms for evaluation.

Result: Streaming RAG increases QA accuracy from 11.1% to 34.2% and reduces tool use latency by 20%, as demonstrated on the AudioCRAG benchmark.

Conclusion: Streaming RAG enhances conversational dialogue systems by improving accuracy and responsiveness, providing a path toward real-time AI assistants that effectively handle both audio and textual modalities.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for

### [129] [Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming Full-Duplex End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02066)
*Siddhant Arora,Jinchuan Tian,Hayato Futami,Jiatong Shi,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Emiru Tsunoo,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCoT, a novel streaming framework for end-to-end spoken dialogue systems (SDS) to improve coherence, latency, and interaction handling without relying on traditional voice activity detection (VAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E spoken dialogue systems struggle with distinguishing pauses and turn completions using VAD, and existing duplex models have limitations in architecture complexity and semantic reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces SCoT, a Streaming Chain-of-Thought framework, which alternates between processing fixed-duration user input and generating blockwise responses. Frame-level alignments are used to create intermediate targets for aligned user transcripts and system responses.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates more coherent and understandable responses compared to existing duplex systems while also achieving lower latency and better support for overlapping interactions.

Conclusion: SCoT improves upon limitations of VAD-reliant and duplex SDS models, providing a more effective and efficient approach for real-time dialogue handling.

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

*Jameson Sandler,Ahmet Üstün,Marco Romanelli,Sara Hooker,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes speculative decoding and addresses its inconsistent speed-up across tasks by proposing and validating a fairness improvement strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the unequal benefits of speculative decoding, particularly focusing on its reduced efficiency for under-represented and under-fit tasks.

Method: The paper derives a quantitative analysis of disparate speed-ups, identifies contributing factors, and proposes a mitigation strategy validated across multiple model pairs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a 12% improvement in fairness in terms of speculative decoding speed-up disparities.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding's benefits are task-dependent, highlighting fairness concerns. The proposed mitigation strategy effectively reduces speed-up disparities.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

### [131] [RESTRAIN: From Spurious Votes to Signals -- Self-Driven RL with Self-Penalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02172)
*Zhaoning Yu,Will Su,Leitian Tao,Haozhu Wang,Aashu Singh,Hanchao Yu,Jianyu Wang,Hongyang Gao,Weizhe Yuan,Jason Weston,Ping Yu,Jing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RESTRAIN, a reinforcement learning framework that uses unlabeled data to improve reasoning performance through self-penalization mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving reasoning in models rely on costly human-labeled data, which are not scalable and struggle on harder tasks.

Method: RESTRAIN uses the model's answer distribution to penalize overconfident and inconsistent outputs while rewarding promising reasoning chains. It integrates with policy optimization methods like GRPO for continual learning without supervision.

Result: The framework showed significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks, such as +140.7% Pass@1 on AIME25 and other datasets, achieving performance close to models trained on gold-labeled data.

Conclusion: RESTRAIN provides a scalable and effective method for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large models without reliance on curated labels.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

### [132] [Learning to Reason for Hallucination Span Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02173)
*Hsuan Su,Ting-Yao Hu,Hema Swetha Koppula,Kundan Krishna,Hadi Pouransari,Cheng-Yu Hsieh,Cem Koc,Joseph Yitan Cheng,Oncel Tuzel,Raviteja Vemulapalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores addressing hallucinations in Large Language Models by detecting hallucinated spans using explicit reasoning and reinforcement learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM outputs undermine their reliability, making hallucination detection in multi-step tasks essential for real-world applications.

Method: The paper compares pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and introduces RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework with span-level reward functions that optimize reasoning processes.

Result: RL4HS outperforms pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning on RAGTruth benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting hallucination spans.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with span-level rewards is critical for improving hallucination detection, highlighting the importance of explicit reasoning in complex LLM tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

*Felix Brei,Lorenz Bühmann,Johannes Frey,Daniel Gerber,Lars-Peter Meyer,Claus Stadler,Kirill Bulert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an iterative LLM-based method for translating natural language to SPARQL queries to simplify interaction with knowledge graphs for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interacting with knowledge graphs requires expertise in SPARQL, which poses a steep learning curve for non-computer scientists.

Method: Introduced SPINACH, an LLM-based iterative agent that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries through exploration and execution, rather than in a single step.

Result: Provided the architecture and analysis of the SPINACH agent's behavior, highlighting areas to improve Text2SPARQL translation tools.

Conclusion: Iterative translation methods using LLMs can significantly lower the barrier for accessing and querying knowledge graphs effectively, advancing the Text2SPARQL domain.

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

### [134] [Say One Thing, Do Another? Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204)
*Lingzhong Dong,Ziqi Zhou,Shuaibo Yang,Haiyue Sheng,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Zheng Wu,Gongshen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new evaluation framework to identify reasoning-execution gaps in mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs). It combines Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA) with Exact Match (EM) metrics to diagnose failures in reasoning and execution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the potential of VLM-powered mobile-use agents, existing evaluations overlook reasoning-execution alignment, leading to over-trust and significant risks such as harmful actions, financial loss, or trust crises.

Method: The authors propose a combined evaluation framework using Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA) and Exact Match (EM) metrics to assess reasoning and execution accuracy jointly. It identifies two reasoning-execution gap types: Execution Gap (EG) and Reasoning Gap (RG).

Result: The study uncovers a prevalence of reasoning-execution gaps across mobile interaction tasks, revealing that execution gaps occur more often. Scaling model size reduces gaps, but even large models retain notable execution discrepancies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework reliably diagnoses systematic reasoning-execution gaps in state-of-the-art models, aiding the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents and emphasizing the need to address alignment issues in VLM models.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

*Xiaoyang Yuan,Yujuan Ding,Yi Bin,Wenqi Shao,Jinyu Cai,Jingkuan Song,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMPO, a framework leveraging multiple teachers in reinforcement learning to improve reasoning diversity and performance in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current reliance on singular teacher models and intrinsic biases in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Method: Develop AMPO, employing adaptive multi-teacher guidance and comprehension-based selection for efficient exploration and improved learning.

Result: AMPO outperforms previous methods, showing significant improvements (4.3% on math tasks, 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks) compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMPO offers a scalable and efficient paradigm to boost reasoning and generalization in language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

*Ebtesam Jaber Aljohani,Wael M. S. Yafoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of Arabic-language cyberbullying detection models and proposes robust deep learning-based approaches achieving up to 98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rising issue of cyberbullying in Arabic-language social media content and the scarcity of detection tools for Arabic-language cyberbullying compared to English-language models.

Method: Researchers assembled a dataset of 10,662 posts from the social media platform X, pre-processed the data, and applied deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and BERT variants) combined with diverse word embeddings to evaluate the effectiveness of detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying.

Result: The deep learning models demonstrated high accuracy, with Bi-LSTM using FastText embedding achieving 98% accuracy in identifying Arabic cyberbullying content.

Conclusion: The study successfully improves methods for detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying by achieving exceptional accuracy levels, thereby contributing to better monitoring and protection on social media platforms.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

*Tianyi Jiang,Yi Bin,Yujuan Ding,Kainian Zhu,Fei Ma,Jingkuan Song,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overthinking in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a novel metric and reasoning paradigm to optimize reasoning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems, reducing efficiency and adaptability.

Method: The authors introduce the Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA) metric and a reasoning paradigm called 'Explore Briefly, Then Decide,' supported by a Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism.

Result: The approach substantially mitigates overthinking without affecting problem-solving ability, reducing the average reasoning length by up to 71% on simpler datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances reasoning efficiency in LLMs, making them more adaptable and effective for diverse problem complexities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoMosaic-Bench, a benchmark for assessing tool-augmented LLM agents in multi-source information seeking, emphasizing deficiencies in current agents' tool integration capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents overly depend on web search which is noisy, unreliable, and often lacks domain-specific knowledge, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: The study uses InfoMosaic-Bench spanning six domains and utilizes the InfoMosaic-Flow pipeline to create complex tasks requiring combined use of general-purpose search and domain-specific tools.

Result: Experiments revealed gaps in performance, with GPT-5 achieving only moderate accuracy and pass rates, inconsistent domain tool benefits, and significant failures due to poor tool usage.

Conclusion: This work highlights the need for improved LLM capabilities for tool integration and complex, multi-source information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the ability of English-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to generalize their reasoning capabilities across multiple languages and establishes metrics for cross-lingual evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) models being overly English-centric, thereby exploring whether reasoning skills can transfer effectively across languages.

Method: Using multilingual benchmarks, interventional studies, and parallel training experiments, alongside introducing new metrics to assess cross-lingual transferability.

Result: Cross-lingual transferability depends heavily on initial model proficiency, target language, and training paradigms. Parallel training improves performance predictably, while English-specific patterns hinder generalization.

Conclusion: English-centric LRMs struggle to generalize reasoning across languages, revealing the need for more language-agnostic methodologies and challenging the notion of human-like reasoning across linguistic systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

TL;DR: F2LLM are high-performing embedding models optimized for performance and cost-efficiency that outperform similarly sized models in embedding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current top-ranking embedding models rely heavily on complex, resource-intensive pipeline designs and synthetic datasets, necessitating a more efficient and cost-effective approach.

Method: F2LLM finetunes foundation models on 6 million real-world query-document-negative tuples from open-source datasets, eliminating reliance on synthetic data or demanding training frameworks.

Result: F2LLM-4B secures a 2nd place ranking for 4B-parameter models and 7th overall on the MTEB English leaderboard, while F2LLM-1.7B achieves the top spot among 1B-2B models.

Conclusion: F2LLM establishes itself as an effective and cost-conscious baseline for embedding-focused research, with publicly released models and resources to promote reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic
datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and
embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd
among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B
ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research
in the field, we release the models, training dataset, and code, positioning
F2LLM as a strong, reproducible, and budget-friendly baseline for future works.

*Raphael Tang,Crystina Zhang,Wenyan Li,Carmen Lai,Pontus Stenetorp,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of the Elo rating system for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in arena-style battles, questioning the interpretation of draws, and shows that ignoring draws can improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation framework for LLMs by questioning the conventional interpretation of "draws" and exploring their relationship with query difficulty.

Method: The authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets using four rating systems, analyzing the impact of ignoring draws on prediction accuracy.

Result: Ignoring rating adjustments for draws led to a 1-3% relative improvement in battle outcome prediction accuracy. Draws were associated more with easy or objective queries, with risk ratios of 1.37 and 1.35 respectively.

Conclusion: The paper recommends revising the semantics of draws in LLM rating systems and incorporating query properties to enhance the evaluation framework.

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

### [144] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LVTINO, leveraging Video Consistency Models to develop zero-shot high-definition video restoration with state-of-the-art results in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend state-of-the-art generative diffusion model advances from image restoration to high-definition video restoration while addressing issues of temporal inconsistency.

Method: Use Video Consistency Models (VCMs) to encode priors for video restoration, bypassing automatic differentiation and focusing on temporal causality.

Result: Achieved superior video restoration quality, measurement consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LVTINO sets a new benchmark for video restoration by effectively overcoming temporal inconsistency and providing computationally efficient solutions.

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [145] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for generating stylized images using pretrained models by extracting fine-grained styles from a single reference image and integrating these into the generative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle to capture fine-grained style details due to the limitations of natural language descriptions and misalignment between text guidance and visual styles.

Method: The study introduces a three-stage training process combining a style encoder, a style projection layer, and the Style30k-captions dataset to enable precise alignment between textual inputs and stylistic cues.

Result: The approach successfully achieves fine-grained controlled stylized image generation without modifying the structure of the pretrained models.

Conclusion: Fine-grained style control can be achieved in text-to-image generation models by effectively aligning stylistic features with textual cues, opening up new possibilities for stylized image synthesis.

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [146] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a new dataset and framework for detecting and analyzing struggles during human skill acquisition in various tasks through temporal action localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how individuals struggle and evolve during skill learning is critical for optimizing learning processes and creating effective assistive systems, but previous datasets lack insights into the temporal evolution of struggles.

Method: The study created a dataset with 61.68 hours of video, capturing 5,385 annotated struggle instances during 18 tasks repeated five times by 76 participants. Struggles were analyzed as temporal action localization problems using specialized models.

Result: The models achieved an average mAP of 34.56% for generalizing across tasks and 19.24% for generalizing across activities, showing promise but leaving room for improvement in detecting struggles in unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Struggle detection is a transferable yet challenging concept across skill-based tasks, providing a foundation for further development in skill acquisition understanding. The newly made dataset facilitates this research direction.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces SPUS, a lightweight residual U-Net-based foundation model for efficiently solving various PDEs with fewer computational and data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PDE solvers using large transformer models are computationally expensive and lack parameter efficiency.

Method: SPUS employs a residual U-Net architecture coupled with an auto-regressive pretraining strategy simulating numerical solvers for learning underlying physics.

Result: SPUS generalizes effectively across 6 unseen PDE tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SPUS establishes itself as an efficient, compact foundation model for diverse PDE systems, offering significant reductions in computational resource needs.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [148] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DisCo, a framework that improves multi-human text-to-image models by addressing issues like duplicated faces and incorrect counts. It leverages a reinforcement learning approach to achieve better identity diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art text-to-image models fail on multi-human prompts, producing errors like face duplication and merging identities. Addressing these limitations is crucial for tasks requiring accurate and diverse human representations.

Method: DisCo, based on reinforcement learning, uses Group-Relative Policy Optimization and a compositional reward system with components penalizing facial similarity, discouraging identity repetition, enforcing person counts, and preserving visual fidelity. The framework operates without extra annotations, using a single-stage training curriculum.

Result: On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieved 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread, outperforming existing open-source and proprietary methods while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Conclusion: DisCo offers a scalable and annotation-free solution to improve multi-human generation by resolving identity-related challenges, setting a new standard for such generative models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for worldwide visual geo-localization using a hierarchical geographic embedding model and a fused visual representation combining appearance features with semantic segmentation maps. It showcases significant improvements across benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve learned representations of geography for determining an image's geographic location across the globe solely based on visual content.

Method: The approach uses a hierarchical geographic embedding model and combines appearance features of query images with their semantic segmentation maps to create a robust visual representation.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming previous methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models across 22 out of 25 metrics measured on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The combination of hierarchical geographic embeddings and fused visual representations effectively enhances geo-localization performance, as supported by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [150] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel data-efficient method called XMAS for instruction tuning of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), focusing on reducing training dataset redundancy while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data selection in LVLMs fail to outperform random selection, highlighting the need for a principled approach to improve data efficiency during instruction tuning.

Method: The method, XMAS, clusters examples based on the top singular value trajectories of their cross-modal attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. Balanced subsets are then sampled from these clusters to eliminate redundancy.

Result: XMAS reduces the LLaVA-665k dataset by 50% and the Vision-Flan dataset by 85% without any performance degradation on downstream benchmarks, achieving a 1.2x training speed-up. This represents a 30% higher data reduction compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: XMAS demonstrates a significant advancement in data-efficient training for LVLMs by effectively addressing redundancy, enabling faster training while preserving performance.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Purrception, a hybrid approach combining continuous and discrete modeling for efficient image generation using vector-quantized latents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image generation by bridging the gap between continuous transport methods and discrete categorical supervision.

Method: Purrception uses Variational Flow Matching applied to vector-quantized image latents, learning categorical posteriors in continuous embedding space for efficient training and generating temperature-controlled outputs.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates faster training convergence than baseline methods and competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k for 256x256 image generation.

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching can integrate continuous dynamics with discrete elements to improve training efficiency while providing robust image generation performance.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [152] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework combining synthetic contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) image generation and segmentation to reduce contrast agent use in assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices with contrast-enhanced CT are risky due to nephrotoxicity, allergies, and environmental concerns. Existing deep learning methods for reducing contrast agent use often rely on multi-stage processes that are error-prone and fail to exploit shared data features.

Method: The authors propose a unified conditional diffusion model integrated with multi-task learning. Their approach jointly optimizes synthetic CECT generation and anatomical segmentation while using a semi-supervised training strategy for real-world datasets.

Result: On a dataset of 264 patients, the model outperformed existing methods, achieving a PSNR of 25.61 dB for image synthesis and Dice scores of 0.89 (lumen) and 0.53 (thrombus) for segmentation. Clinical measurements also improved significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both image quality and segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, providing a safer alternative for AAA diagnostics without reliance on contrast agents.

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to simplify multi-modal content analysis by combining pre-trained models and structured representations for videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing multi-modal content like videos is complex, resource-intensive, and requires considerable engineering, motivating the need for an efficient framework.

Method: The authors create a pipeline combining pre-trained models to convert videos to temporal semi-structured data. This is converted into a frame-level indexed knowledge graph for querying and continual learning.

Result: The framework enables efficient prototype pipelines for video content analysis, supporting dynamic knowledge incorporation and interactive use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework simplifies multi-modal content analysis while enabling future adaptability and dynamic learning.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

TL;DR: WALT automates browsing tasks by using website-provided tools like search, filter, and sort, reducing reliance on brittle step-by-step interactions and LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more robust web agents that can exploit existing website functionalities instead of depending on ineffective step-by-step UI interactions that fail on dynamic layouts.

Method: The WALT framework reverse-engineers websites to uncover latent tools like search and sort, allowing agents to invoke these reusable functionalities instead of manually simulating UI actions.

Result: WALT significantly improves success rates for browser automation tasks, requiring fewer actions and less dependence on complex LLM-driven reasoning.

Conclusion: WALT establishes a more reliable and generalizable approach to browser automation by leveraging built-in website tools, reducing the burden on agents to reason step-by-step.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-supervised segmentation framework to capture semantic structures in histopathology images by ensuring topological consistency between predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathology images contain densely distributed objects, making it difficult to capture meaningful semantic structures using semi-supervised methods.

Method: The proposed method enforces consistency across perturbed predictions generated via stochastic dropouts and temporal snapshots, integrating a novel matching strategy that combines spatial overlap and global structural alignment.

Result: Experiments show that the approach successfully reduces topological errors, yielding robust and accurate segmentations.

Conclusion: The framework's ability to preserve topological features proves critical for enhancing segmentation accuracy in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

### [156] [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540)
*Jiamu Bai,Xin Yu,Meilong Xu,Weitao Lu,Xin Pan,Kiwan Maeng,Daniel Kifer,Jian Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-LPO enhances reinforcement learning from human feedback for text-to-image models, optimizing listwise preferences over traditional pairwise methods to better align generated images with ranked user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback on image preferences often contains ranked information, which conveys more nuances than simple pairwise comparisons. Current methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are computationally efficient but lack mechanisms to optimize listwise preferences for diffusion models.

Method: The paper introduces Diffusion-LPO, a framework that aggregates ranked user feedback into a list and formulates a listwise extension of the DPO objective based on the Plackett-Luce model. It promotes consistency across rankings, ensuring higher-ranked images are preferred over lower-ranked ones.

Result: Diffusion-LPO demonstrates superior performance in tasks like text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. It consistently surpasses pairwise DPO models in both visual quality and alignment with user preferences.

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO is effective and scalable for optimizing diffusion models using human feedback with ranked preferences, offering advancements in visual quality and user alignment compared to pairwise optimization approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bridge, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that handles both visual understanding and generation tasks using a pure autoregressive framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in building unified MLLMs that effectively balance the trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity, as well as to simplify the autoregressive paradigm for visual and textual data.

Method: Bridge employs a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and introduces a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation, which integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens for enhanced output quality.

Result: Bridge demonstrates competitive or better performance across various multimodal benchmarks for both visual understanding and generation tasks, with less training data and shorter training time than earlier models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Bridge successfully integrates image understanding and generation without compromising on fidelity or semantic alignment, making it an efficient and effective unified MLLM.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual

### [158] [Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01547)
*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in early oral cancer diagnosis by presenting a hybrid CNN-Bayesian deep learning model that quantifies uncertainty and improves reliability, especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer has high mortality due to inadequate healthcare in certain regions, and early diagnosis is hindered by limited resources and unreliable conventional deep learning models.

Method: A hybrid approach combining CNN and Bayesian deep learning was developed, leveraging variational inference to incorporate uncertainty quantification, trained on smartphone images, and tested in diverse datasets.

Result: On similar distribution datasets, the model reached 94% accuracy (on par with conventional CNNs), and on diverse real-world datasets, it achieved 88% (outperforming traditional CNNs at 72.94%), showcasing better generalizability.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference significantly enhances the reliability and generalizability of oral cancer diagnosis models in data-scarce environments, offering a promising tool for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

### [159] [Cross-Breed Pig Identification Using Auricular Vein Pattern Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach for Small-Scale Farming Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02197)
*Emmanuel Nsengiyumvaa,Leonard Niyitegekaa,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a cost-effective biometric pig identification method based on auricular vein patterns, achieving high accuracy and real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pig identification methods are unreliable and impractical for small farmers due to cost and constraints on mixed breeds.

Method: Auricular vein patterns were captured using smartphone images and backlighting; features were extracted via computer vision and classified using SVM models.

Result: SVM achieved 98.12% accuracy in identification across mixed breeds, with processing completed in 8.3 seconds on average.

Conclusion: This biometric system using auricular veins provides a viable, stress-free animal identification method, advancing digital livestock management for small-scale farmers.

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

### [160] [Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559)
*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Kangyang Luo,Qin Li,and Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents CADTrans, a source-free domain adaptation method enhancing feature invariance and alignment for diverse data samples by leveraging consistent assistant domains and a CMK-MMD strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of SFDA where the source domain data is inaccessible, existing solutions fail to adequately handle hard samples and domain bias, which affects their robustness.

Method: CADTrans introduces an assistant domain module for diversified intermediate representations and employs consistent strategies to achieve robust invariable feature representations. It uses a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy for aligning hard samples to easy samples.

Result: CADTrans demonstrates significant performance gains in SFDA tasks through experiments on benchmarks like Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126.

Conclusion: By constructing invariable feature representations and addressing hard samples with CMK-MMD, CADTrans effectively overcomes domain bias and enhances SFDA capabilities.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a system utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate context-aware descriptions for Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users, enhancing efficiency and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of visual interpretation applications for BLV users, which often produce lengthy and irrelevant descriptions.

Method: The system leverages historical BLV user questions from the VizWiz-LF dataset to guide MLLMs to deliver more contextually relevant image descriptions.

Result: Context-aware descriptions answered users’ questions in 76.1% of cases and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons during human evaluation.

Conclusion: Context-aware descriptions significantly improve the relevance and usefulness of visual information for BLV users, proving the value of historical user data in guiding MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader
understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation

### [163] [NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608)
*Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN), a new class of regularization for imaging inverse problems that uses neural networks to focus on the null-space structure of the sensing operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging inverse problems face challenges due to the fundamentally ill-posed nature of recovering signals from undersampled, noisy measurements. Existing priors often ignore the null-space structure specific to the sensing operator.

Method: The study proposes NPN, which uses neural networks to project solutions into a low-dimensional representation of the sensing matrix's null-space, instead of traditional constraints in the image domain.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that NPN consistently improves reconstruction fidelity across different imaging modalities and methods like compressive sensing, super-resolution, and computed tomography.

Conclusion: NPN offers interpretability, task adaptability, and compatibility with various existing frameworks for enhancing the accuracy of imaging inverse problems.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated system that transforms raw DNA sequences into interpretable decisions for medical and robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making to enhance clinical and robotic automation in genomics.

Method: The framework integrates Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and incorporates reliability mechanisms such as concept fidelity supervision and uncertainty calibration.

Result: The system achieves superior classification performance, concept prediction fidelity, and cost-benefit efficiency in comparison to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a reliable foundation for genomic interpretation, enabling automated and interpretable decision-making in clinical and robotic applications.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-R1, a Vision-Language-Action model enhanced with reasoning capabilities through novel reinforcement learning and a new dataset to boost reasoning and execution performance, offering improved generalization and real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack explicit reasoning, skipping step-by-step decision-making and reliance on weak post-training reward strategies, limiting their performance in generalization and execution.

Method: VLA-R1 enhances reasoning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), alongside a new dataset VLA-CoT-13K for chain-of-thought supervision aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations.

Result: Extensive evaluations show VLA-R1 outperforms previous Vision-Language-Action models in generalization, simulation, and real-world performance across diverse platforms.

Conclusion: VLA-R1 can successfully integrate reasoning capabilities into Vision-Language-Action frameworks, making it more robust and effective in real-world scenarios, with plans to release all associated resources for broader use.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

*Yifan Zhao,Liangchen Li,Yuqi Zhou,Kai Wang,Yan Liang,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint method for deblurring and 3D reconstruction in macrophotography, addressing the limitations of existing techniques through the use of multi-view blurry images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges posed by defocus blur in macrophotography, resulting in clearer imaging and improved 3D reconstruction for small, detailed objects.

Method: The method involves capturing multi-view blurry images and optimizing the object's 3D model and defocus blur kernel using a differentiable rendering framework for self-supervised learning.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates the ability to deblur images and recover high-fidelity 3D appearances from a limited number of views, as supported by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This approach successfully addresses defocus blur, combining image deblurring with multi-view 3D reconstruction to achieve superior outcomes in macrophotography.

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FideDiff, a single-step diffusion model aimed at overcoming challenges in motion deblurring tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of diffusion models in image deblurring, such as slow inference speeds and compromised fidelity.

Method: FideDiff reformulates motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process, training a consistency model for one-step deblurring while incorporating Kernel ControlNet and adaptive timestep prediction.

Result: The proposed model surpasses previous diffusion-based approaches on full-reference metrics and achieves comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FideDiff represents a promising step for leveraging pre-trained diffusion models in high-fidelity image restoration applications, offering a strong baseline for future advancements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale dataset and a new method for recognizing ancient Chinese bronze inscription characters, overcoming challenges like visual degradation and rare class distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bronze inscriptions are crucial for historical and archaeological studies, but their automatic recognition has been hindered by challenges such as visual degradation, multi-domain variability, and long-tailed character distribution.

Method: The study creates a dataset with 22454 images and 198598 annotated characters, spanning 6658 unique categories, and proposes a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline enhanced with a LadderMoE architecture for dynamic domain handling and rare class specialization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy across all character types and domains (head, mid, tail) in recognition tasks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust solution for bronze inscription recognition, laying the groundwork for further archaeological and historical studies.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VirDA, a method for domain adaptation in visual tasks that prepends a lightweight reprogramming layer to add textural biases without fine-tuning backbones, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pipelines, particularly the need for fine-tuning backbone parameters for each source-target pair, which scales poorly in terms of parameters and storage.

Method: The paper proposes VirDA, which applies domain-specific visual prompts via a reprogramming layer added to the backbone. Optimizations are driven by objective functions focused on intra- and inter-domain distribution differences, avoiding backbone parameter changes.

Result: VirDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Office-31 with 92.8% mean accuracy using only 1.5M trainable parameters. It surpasses PDA by +1.6% in accuracy and performs on par with or exceeds other methods while using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: VirDA demonstrates that leveraging textural biases through lightweight domain-specific reprogramming layers can effectively substitute fine-tuning entire backbones, resulting in parameter efficiency while maintaining strong domain adaptation performance.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised tool for analyzing facial expressions using a data-driven approach and advanced encoding methods, outperforming existing systems like FACS in psychological tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression analysis systems are limited in coverage and require costly manual annotations, restricting their scalability and effectiveness.

Method: Proposed a method using a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) to extract identity-invariant facial expression features and create a compact dictionary of reusable facial deformations.

Result: Performed better than FACS and other encoding alternatives in stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection, demonstrating improved precision and broader coverage of facial behaviors.

Conclusion: DFE offers a scalable, interpretable, and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Result: Experimental results from synthetic and real datasets show the proposed method's superiority in reconstruction accuracy and robustness over others.

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM enhances depth and conformal scale estimation, enabling robust monocular visual mapping in deformable environments, and the code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

### [172] [UniVerse: Unleashing the Scene Prior of Video Diffusion Models for Robust Radiance Field Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01669)
*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniVerse, a unified framework for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes from inconsistent multi-view images using a video diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene reconstruction struggle with dense observations and inconsistent image inputs, highlighting the need for a more efficient approach to handle these challenges.

Method: The framework decouples reconstruction into restoration and reconstruction subtasks. It uses a video diffusion model to convert inconsistent images into initially consistent videos, restore them, and then rebuild the 3D scenes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong generalization and superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively handling diverse image inconsistencies.

Conclusion: UniVerse simplifies robust 3D scene reconstruction by leveraging diffusion models, achieving improved outcomes while enabling style control over the reconstructed scenes.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [173] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework for template matching that efficiently estimates a target’s position and geometric pose under complex conditions, overcoming limitations of traditional and deep learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in existing template matching methods that struggle with compound transformations and fail to explicitly model geometric poses, limiting their applicability in real-world industrial tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that outputs coordinates, rotation angle, and scaling factors through joint localization and geometric regression. Key developments include the Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM), depthwise separable convolutions, pixel shuffle for efficiency, rotation-shear-based training, and a lightweight refinement module for improved precision.

Result: The proposed model achieves high precision and 14ms inference time, demonstrating robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, suitable for real-time industrial applications.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently addresses the challenges in template matching with significant improvements in precision and robustness, proving highly suitable for deployment in industrial tasks requiring real-time performance.

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

### [174] [Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive pixel reasoning framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), dynamically determining necessary pixel operations to improve accuracy and efficiency in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with fine-grained visual tasks due to information loss during encoding or insufficient attention to key regions.

Method: The framework involves operation-aware supervised fine-tuning and a rollout-guided reinforcement learning mechanism to determine when pixel-level operations are required based on the query.

Result: The model achieved superior performance, including 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K, with a reduced tool usage ratio of 20.1%, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Adaptive pixel reasoning enhances the precision and efficiency of VLMs in tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding, reducing unnecessary pixel-level operations and improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

### [175] [Uncovering Overconfident Failures in CXR Models via Augmentation-Sensitivity Risk Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01683)
*Han-Jay Shu,Wei-Ning Chiu,Shun-Ting Chang,Meng-Ping Huang,Takeshi Tohyama,Ahram Han,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring framework (ASRS) to identify high-risk chest radiograph (CXR) cases, addressing fairness and reliability issues in deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by fairness and reliability concerns in applying deep learning models for CXR interpretation, as these models often fail for specific patient subgroups despite high aggregate accuracy metrics.

Method: The method employs an ASRS framework that uses clinically plausible image rotations and measures embedding shifts through a RAD-DINO encoder, producing sensitivity scores to stratify cases based on stability.

Result: The framework demonstrated that cases with high sensitivity scores tend to have significantly lower recall, indicating their potential for hidden failures, even when aggregate metric performance is high.

Conclusion: ASRS offers a label-free approach for recognizing error-prone cases, supporting selective predictions and clinician reviews, ultimately enhancing fairness and reliability in medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

*Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Ke Zhang,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeViS is a training-free video stylization framework that ensures rich style details and strong temporal coherence without computationally expensive requirements or paired video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in video stylization, specifically maintaining temporal consistency while ensuring style richness, and providing an accessible approach free from training constraints.

Method: FreeViS integrates multiple stylized references into a pretrained image-to-video model, employs high-frequency compensation to constrain motion and layout, and uses flow-based motion cues for preserving textures in low-saliency regions.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved stylization fidelity, superior temporal consistency, mitigated propagation errors, and strong human preference compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: FreeViS offers a practical and cost-effective solution for creating high-quality stylized videos with strong temporal coherence, avoiding the need for extensive computational resources or paired datasets.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedQ-Bench, a benchmark that uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to evaluate medical image quality through perception and reasoning tasks, aiming for human-like assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image quality assessment approaches rely on simple scalar metrics and lack comprehensive reasoning similar to human evaluations, limiting their clinical reliability.

Method: MedQ-Bench categorizes evaluation into two tasks: MedQ-Perception, testing visual attributes through curated questions, and MedQ-Reasoning, covering assessments without reference and comparisons. It uses a multidimensional human-AI judging protocol for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 14 leading MLLMs showed unstable perceptual and reasoning capabilities, failing to achieve reliable accuracy for clinical application. Radiologist comparison validated the gap in judgment alignment.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for optimizing MLLMs toward more accurate medical image quality assessments, and aims to encourage development in this domain for clinical safety and efficacy.

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

*Pierre Musacchio,Hyunmin Lee,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstaFormer, a model that predicts occlusion and depth orderings of objects in a scene from a single RGB image through one forward pass, addressing limitations of existing visual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual models for instance-wise geometries demand expensive input formats and high inference costs, making them impractical for broader applications.

Method: InstaFormer uses object queries and latent mask descriptors to predict occlusion and depth orderings in a scene from a single RGB image in a single forward pass.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies.

Conclusion: InstaFormer provides an efficient solution to understanding visual instance geometries, reducing input and inference costs while offering accurate holistic order prediction.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

*Raahul Krishna Durairaju,K. Saruladha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyramidStyler introduces a novel transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding and reinforcement learning for faster, high-quality neural style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for neural style transfer struggle with scaling efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs.

Method: PyramidStyler implements Pyramidal Positional Encoding for hierarchical multi-scale processing and integrates reinforcement learning to optimize stylization.

Result: The framework reduces content loss by 62.6% and style loss by 57.4%, achieving real-time inference speeds of ~1.39 s, with better outcomes using RL.

Conclusion: PyramidStyler demonstrates efficient, scalable, and real-time artistic image rendering for applications in media and design.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoBE-GS is a novel pipeline for scalable and efficient large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting that significantly reduces training time while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches struggle with scalability and efficiency in processing large and unbounded scenes due to memory pressure, load imbalance, and inefficient coarse-to-fine pipelines.

Method: LoBE-GS introduces three key innovations: depth-aware partitioning, optimization-based load balancing, and lightweight techniques like visibility cropping and selective densification.

Result: LoBE-GS achieves up to 2× faster training times on large-scale datasets while preserving reconstruction quality and enabling scalability.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS redefines the efficiency and scalability of 3DGS, facilitating processing of large and previously infeasible scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

*Xiaofei Wu,Guozhen Zhang,Zhiyong Xu,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two novel methods, MemoryPack for dynamic context modeling and Direct Forcing for error mitigation, to improve long-form video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dual challenges of capturing long-range dependencies and preventing error accumulation in long-form video generation.

Method: Introduces MemoryPack, a learnable mechanism to model short- and long-term dependencies, and Direct Forcing, a single-step approximating strategy to reduce error propagation.

Result: MemoryPack and Direct Forcing improve temporal consistency, computational efficiency, and reliability in autoregressive video models.

Conclusion: These methods advance the practical usability of autoregressive video models, enhancing long-form video generation.

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses confidence calibration for 3D object detection by proposing loss terms that improve calibration of both dominant and secondary class predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are vital for autonomous systems to ensure self-awareness and operational safety.

Method: Two auxiliary loss terms were introduced during model training for dominant prediction calibration and full prediction vector calibration. Post-hoc methods like isotonic regression were combined for evaluation.

Result: Combining the proposed loss terms and isotonic regression improved calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet models, although DSVT-Pillar showed limitations in achieving joint calibration for dominant and secondary predictions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of calibration across all predictive confidence distributions and suggests model-specific solutions for optimal calibration outcomes.

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPS introduces a novel framework using a pre-trained diffusion model to handle person search. It improves person localization and identification with three specialized modules, setting new benchmarks on CUHK-SYSU and PRW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing person search models mainly rely on suboptimal features from ImageNet pre-trained backbones and shared optimization objectives, hampering performance.

Method: DiffPS uses a pre-trained diffusion model and introduces three modules: Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal for better localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement to address shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation to utilize text-aligned diffusion features.

Result: DiffPS achieves state-of-the-art results on CUHK-SYSU and PRW person search benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: By leveraging diffusion priors and decoupling conflicting optimization tasks, DiffPS significantly enhances the performance of person search systems.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyperspectral imaging reconstruction is enhanced using the FMU network, which integrates flow matching in a deep unfolding framework. It achieves better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reconstructing hyperspectral imaging data efficiently and accurately due to hardware limitations, and degradation of spectral details.

Method: Developing the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU), combining flow matching's generative prior with deep unfolding frameworks, and introducing a mean velocity loss for global consistency.

Result: FMU network demonstrated superior reconstruction quality in hyperspectral imaging compared to current methods, both on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The FMU hybrid design successfully merges optimization interpretability with generative capacity, setting a new benchmark for hyperspectral imaging reconstruction efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated defect detection system for industry components, specifically DIP packaging, utilizing deep learning models and data augmentation methods to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect detection for industry components is traditionally time-intensive and laborious, leading to challenges in product quality management.

Method: The study employs digital camera optics, deep learning models (YOLO variants), and ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address the scarcity of defective images. Additionally, a SCADA system with sensors is developed.

Result: The YOLOv7 model paired with ConSinGAN achieved superior performance, with 95.50% accuracy and 285 ms detection time.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a reliable solution for automated defect detection even under conditions of limited defect data, demonstrating significant advancements in industrial quality control.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Few-shot anomaly detection is enhanced by leveraging foundation visual encoders, and FoundAD is introduced as a lightweight yet competitive detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in few-shot anomaly detection, especially under category-agnostic conditions, by leveraging large-scale pre-trained visual encoders.

Method: The proposed FoundAD system learns a nonlinear projection operator to map images onto the manifold of natural images, enabling identification of out-of-distribution regions based on embeddings.

Result: The FoundAD approach achieves multi-class anomaly detection with competitive performance using fewer parameters compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: FoundAD, supported by evaluations across diverse foundation encoders, expands the utilization of foundation visual features, pushing the boundaries of few-shot anomaly detection.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

### [187] [ClustViT: Clustering-based Token Merging for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01948)
*Fabio Montello,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT is a Vision Transformer extension for semantic segmentation that merges tokens using a clustering approach, leading to faster and more efficient performance while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is the quadratic attention complexity of Vision Transformers, which limits their real-world applicability in areas requiring efficient inference, like robotics and dense prediction tasks.

Method: The authors introduce ClustViT, which leverages a trainable Cluster module to dynamically merge similar tokens based on segmentation mask guidance, and a Regenerator module to restore detailed features for downstream tasks.

Result: The proposed ClustViT reduces computational complexity by up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and achieves 1.64x faster inference while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy across three datasets.

Conclusion: ClustViT demonstrates that efficient token merging strategies combined with detail restoration can make Vision Transformers practical for dense prediction tasks, striking a balance between performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

*Yongyi Su,Haojie Zhang,Shijie Li,Nanqing Liu,Jingyi Liao,Junyi Pan,Yuan Liu,Xiaofen Xing,Chong Sun,Chen Li,Nancy F. Chen,Shuicheng Yan,Xulei Yang,Xun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a method allowing multimodal large language models to generate both textual and visual outputs for tasks like detection and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with dense vision tasks due to reliance on indirect representations, limiting their performance in activities like segmentation.

Method: The PaDT paradigm introduces Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from patch embeddings, which are dynamically integrated and processed within output tokens of language models. This is paired with a lightweight decoder and tailored training strategy, including supervised fine-tuning and a robust per-token cross-entropy loss.

Result: PaDT demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across four visual perception tasks, outperforming even larger models.

Conclusion: PaDT effectively bridges the gap between multimodal text and vision tasks, enabling direct, diverse, and high-performance outputs, marking significant progress in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

### [189] [TriAlignXA: An Explainable Trilemma Alignment Framework for Trustworthy Agri-product Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01990)
*Jianfei Xie,Ziyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the trust deficit in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce by constructing a 'Trust Pyramid' model, introducing the 'Triangular Trust Index' and TriAlignXA framework, and achieving better grading task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the trust deficit in online agricultural e-commerce caused by consumers' inability to assess product quality before purchase.

Method: The authors propose the TriAlignXA explainable AI framework featuring three optimization engines (Bio-Adaptive, Timeliness, Economic) and a Pre-Mapping Mechanism encoded in QR codes to enhance transparency and decision-making.

Result: The experiments show significantly better grading accuracy, and the framework successfully balances the trade-offs in the 'impossible triangle' of agricultural product grading.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical and practical pathway for building trust in online agricultural e-commerce by leveraging explainable AI and innovative quality assessment mechanisms.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

### [190] [4DGS-Craft: Consistent and Interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01991)
*Lei Liu,Can Wang,Zhenghao Chen,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4DGS-Craft, a framework for consistent and interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting editing, addressing challenges like view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, along with understanding complex user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to tackle the limitations of current 4D Gaussian Splatting editing methods, such as inconsistency in views and temporality, inadequate handling of unedited regions, and difficulty in managing complex text instructions.

Method: The authors propose a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model enhanced with a multi-view grid module for consistency, a Gaussian selection mechanism for targeting edited regions, and an LLM-based module to parse and execute complex user instructions.

Result: The framework successfully achieves consistent and controllable editing of 4D scenes while interpreting intricate user commands. It outperforms existing methods in maintaining view, temporal, and region consistency in numerous scenarios.

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft represents a significant step forward in 4D Gaussian Splatting editing, offering enhanced consistency, user interaction, and editing performance. The approach sets a new benchmark for controllable and precise 4D scene editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Junyu Wu,Jie Tang,Jie Liu,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism to improve Image Super-Resolution by identifying and excluding less complex pixels, achieving superior results with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing lightweight SR methods, including poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking, and spatial inflexibility.

Method: The proposed method, Pure-Pass (PP), uses fixed color center points for pixel categorization to enable fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while maintaining adaptability.

Result: Integrated into the ATD-light model, the PP mechanism improves reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency while saving computation, outperforming prior methods such as CAMixer-ATD-light.

Conclusion: Pure-Pass advances lightweight SR technology by improving adaptability, computational efficiency, and overall SR performance through pixel-level refinement and flexible masking.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

*Nanaka Hosokawa,Ryo Takahashi,Tomoya Kitano,Yukihiro Iida,Chisako Muramatsu,Tatsuro Hayashi,Yuta Seino,Xiangrong Zhou,Takeshi Hara,Akitoshi Katsumata,Hiroshi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduced a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework for utilizing GPT-4o in identifying jaw cysts on dental radiographs. It demonstrated improved accuracy compared to traditional methods, though refinement is needed for extensive lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the automated generation of jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs using a structured and accurate approach.

Method: Implemented a 10-step SLSO framework for processing and iteratively correcting inconsistencies in radiograph analysis, and compared results against the Chain-of-Thought method.

Result: The SLSO framework enhanced the accuracy in areas such as tooth number identification (66.9%), tooth movement (33.3%), and root resorption (28.6%), despite a lack of statistical significance due to the limited dataset.

Conclusion: The SLSO framework improves automated findings generation accuracy and suppresses hallucinations, but more work is needed for identifying larger lesions and enhancing practical usability.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiLa-Net, a 3D autoencoder leveraging LiDAR point clouds to efficiently encode features and reconstruct original data with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently encode features and reconstruct 3D point clouds from traffic environments using LiDAR data without expensive computational resources.

Method: The proposed LiLa-Net architecture employs a reduced number of encoder layers, simplified skip connections, and achieves balance between skip connections and latent representations while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.

Result: The model successfully reconstructs original point clouds and generalizes well to objects not related to the original traffic dataset.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net efficiently balances resource usage and performance, producing strong reconstruction and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces kabr-tools, an open-source tool for automated monitoring of animal behavior using drones and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of studying animal behavior are time-consuming, limited in scope, and labor-intensive, which hinders large-scale ecological and behavioral studies.

Method: The authors developed a framework that uses drone-based video combined with machine learning for object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification to extract key behavioral metrics.

Result: The tool improved observational granularity, reduced visibility loss by 15%, and validated its effectiveness across three case studies involving zebras and mixed-species dynamics.

Conclusion: Kabr-tools advances scalable animal behavior study, offering significant applications in conservation, biodiversity, and ecological research.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

*Mengtian Li,Yunshu Bai,Yimin Chu,Yijun Shen,Zhongmei Li,Weifeng Ge,Zhifeng Xie,Chaofeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianMorphing introduces a novel method for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and consistency without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to 3D shape morphing rely heavily on point clouds or pre-defined mappings, which limit fidelity and flexibility. There is a need for a method that can consistently combine geometry and texture while addressing semantic coherence.

Method: The method uses mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for modeling high-fidelity geometry and appearance. It employs a unified deformation strategy, topology-aware constraints, unsupervised semantic correspondence, and physically plausible point trajectories to ensure detailed, consistent morphing.

Result: GaussianMorphing delivers superior performance on the TexMorph benchmark, reducing color consistency error by 22.2% and EI by 26.2% compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: This framework provides a significant advance in 3D shape and texture morphing by integrating geometry, texture, and semantics without reliance on labeled data, establishing itself as a robust alternative to previous techniques.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

*Sahil Bhandary Karnoor,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes InPose, a method for human pose estimation using limited body sensors, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on rotational measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of pose estimation with sparse on-body sensors and tackle poor generalization across users caused by user-specific body size variations.

Method: Formulates pose estimation as an inverse problem utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on rotational measurements combined with a likelihood term derived from location measurements.

Result: InPose generatively estimates highly probable sequences of poses, demonstrating zero-shot generalization for diverse user body sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed InPose method effectively generalizes across users in pose estimation using sparse sensor measurements by combining generative diffusion models with data-driven likelihood.

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

TL;DR: The paper proposes VGDM, a Vision-Guided Diffusion Model combining transformers and diffusion processes, to enhance brain tumor detection and segmentation from MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve medical image segmentation for brain tumor detection, which faces challenges related to accurately capturing complex structures and long-range dependencies in MRI volumes.

Method: The proposed method integrates a vision transformer within a diffusion framework to enable global contextual reasoning and iterative denoising, improving volumetric accuracy and boundary precision for MRI tumor segmentation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated consistent improvements in metrics like Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance compared to conventional methods, validating the robustness of the hybrid approach.

Conclusion: The results suggest that transformer-guided diffusion models can significantly enhance segmentation performance, offering a promising alternative to traditional architectures like U-Net.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning pipeline to create a nationwide urban footprint dataset for France (1925-1950), overcoming historical map complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of digital urban footprint data for France prior to the 1970s hinders quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl, necessitating the development of scalable solutions.

Method: The researchers developed a dual-pass U-Net leveraging deep learning. Pass one identifies areas of confusion like roads and text to refine the dataset, while pass two reduces noise, ensuring higher accuracy in processing historical maps.

Result: The method, deployed on a high-performance cluster, processed 941 high-resolution tiles of metropolitan France, achieving 73% overall accuracy while handling complex artifacts.

Conclusion: The paper offers an innovative approach to extracting historical urban data, enables long-term urbanization research, and provides open-access resources for future studies.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of point-based tracking for video object segmentation (VOS) in surgical videos, highlighting its limitations, especially for anatomical targets, and provides recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability and limitations of point-based tracking in complex surgical environments specifically during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Method: The study systematically compared point-based tracking against segmentation mask initialization, focusing on three surgical targets (gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery) while performing qualitative analyses of failures.

Result: Point-based tracking performed competitively for tracking surgical tools but was less effective for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.

Conclusion: Point-based tracking is viable for surgical tools but needs improvement for anatomical targets. The paper offers actionable recommendations to enhance tracking quality and placement.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFREEDG, a federated learning task that adapts to new domains using only unlabeled client data. It proposes FRIEREN, leveraging Vision-Language models for improved semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning for Semantic Segmentation struggles with domain shifts and the reliance on labeled client data. Existing methods either assume labeled data or underutilize Vision Foundation Models, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The proposed FRIEREN framework integrates vision and language modalities with a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings. A weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy is employed for robust pseudo-label-based local training.

Result: Experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks show FRIEREN achieves competitive performance compared to existing domain generalization and adaptation methods.

Conclusion: FRIEREN effectively addresses the challenges of FFREEDG, setting a strong baseline for future federated learning and domain adaptation research.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

*Shu Zou,Xinyu Tian,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint enhances video anomaly detection using structured prompting and action-centric knowledge, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and interpretability on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompts fail to capture intricate human-object interactions and action semantics, which are essential for identifying video anomalies in surveillance contexts.

Method: Introduced ASK-Hint, a structured framework that organizes action-centric prompts into semantic groups and uses fine-grained guiding questions to align model predictions with visual cues.

Result: ASK-Hint exhibited consistent AUC improvement and state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, delivering accurate and interpretable anomaly detection.

Conclusion: ASK-Hint showcases the importance of prompt granularity for generalizable and training-free explainable video anomaly detection solutions.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

### [202] [GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02186)
*Weijia Dou,Xu Zhang,Yi Bin,Jian Liu,Bo Peng,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoPurify, a method to transfer 2D vision-language model features to 3D semantic segmentation effectively, reducing noise and improving data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from challenges in transferring features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation, including noisy predictions and the inefficiency of current methods requiring extensive 3D annotations.

Method: GeoPurify leverages a small Student Affinity Network to refine noisy 3D features using geometric priors derived from a self-supervised 3D teacher model. Additionally, a Geometry-Guided Pooling module is employed during inference to preserve semantic and structural consistency.

Result: GeoPurify significantly reduces the need for annotated 3D data, achieving high data efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art methods on major 3D benchmarks using just 1.5% of the training data.

Conclusion: GeoPurify bridges the gap between 2D semantics and 3D geometric structure, offering a data-efficient and robust solution to tackle existing trade-offs in feature transfer for 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

*Villanelle O'Reilly,Jonathan Cox,Georgios Leontidis,Marc Hanheide,Petra Bosilj,James Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-transformer framework for multi-category crowd counting in dense scenes, showing significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in object counting in dense and occluded scenes, especially where traditional detection-based counting fails.

Method: A Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone paired with a segmentation-based Category Focus Module and state-of-the-art multiscale decoding for improved multi-class crowd counting.

Result: Achieved superior performance on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks, reducing errors by up to 64%, and demonstrated applicability to biodiversity datasets.

Conclusion: The method advances multi-class crowd counting, aiding conservation efforts and scalable ecological insights.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

### [204] [TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226)
*Shira Schiber,Ofir Lindenbaum,Idan Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TempoControl, a method for enhancing temporal control in generative video models without retraining, by manipulating cross-attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of fine-grained temporal control in generative video models, which often prevents users from specifying when visual elements should appear in generated sequences.

Method: The proposed method, TempoControl, uses an optimization process based on cross-attention maps in text-to-video diffusion models. It applies principles like temporal alignment via correlation, visibility amplification via energy, and spatial focus via entropy.

Result: TempoControl enables precise temporal control and maintains high video quality and diversity, successfully demonstrating its performance across video generation tasks like temporal reordering, action generation, and audio-aligned creation.

Conclusion: The work establishes a novel and effective approach for temporal control in video generation, contributing to diverse applications while eliminating the need for retraining or additional supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

*Sicheng Feng,Kaiwen Tuo,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Jianke Zhu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReasonMap-Plus and RewardMap significantly advance fine-grained visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing sparse rewards and unstable optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the shortcoming of MLLMs in performing spatial reasoning in tasks like transit maps, which are critical but remain challenging due to sparse rewards and unstable training.

Method: Proposed a new extended dataset (ReasonMap-Plus) and a multi-stage reinforcement learning framework (RewardMap) with a difficulty-aware reward design and staged training from simple to complex tasks.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improved MLLMs' performance, achieving a 3.47% average boost across six benchmarks in spatial, fine-grained visual, and general reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of ReasonMap-Plus and RewardMap demonstrates enhanced visual reasoning capabilities, providing a scalable solution for MLLM training and performance improvement in fine-grained tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

*Zihan Zhou,Shilin Lu,Shuli Leng,Shaocong Zhang,Zhuming Lian,Xinlei Yu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DragFlow, a drag-based image editing framework leveraging advanced generative priors like FLUX to improve image editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drag-based image editing faces challenges due to distortion in target regions, driven by insufficient priors in earlier models.

Method: DragFlow proposes a region-based editing paradigm using affine transformations and pretrained personalization adapters to maintain subject consistency and background fidelity.

Result: DragFlow outperforms existing point-based and region-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on curated benchmarks (DragBench-DR and ReD Bench).

Conclusion: DragFlow effectively harnesses stronger generative priors for drag-based editing, providing substantial advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

### [207] [From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262)
*Guangyu Sun,Archit Singhal,Burak Uzkent,Mubarak Shah,Chen Chen,Garin Kessler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inefficiency of existing methods in Video Large Language Models (VLMs) for understanding motion and event continuity by proposing a training-free approach (F2C) to select temporally coherent key clips instead of sparse frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of VLMs for video understanding, particularly the "needle in a haystack" problem caused by the massive visual tokens and the subsequent loss of temporal dynamics when sparse frames are selected.

Method: The authors introduce F2C, a training-free method that selects key clips rather than isolated frames, and utilizes an adaptive resolution strategy to balance spatial resolution and clip length within a fixed token budget.

Result: Experiments on long-form video benchmarks show significant performance improvements with F2C: up to 8.1% for Video-MME, 5.6% for LongVideoBench, and 10.3% for MLVU.

Conclusion: Preserving temporal coherence in frame selection is crucial for improving video understanding in VLMs, and the F2C method offers a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates video-based 3D human pose estimation models and inertial measurement units (IMUs) for assessing human movement using the VIDIMU dataset, focusing on 13 daily activities in healthy adults. MotionAGFormer showed superior performance among the analyzed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage advancements in machine learning and wearable sensors for accurate assessment of human movement outside laboratory settings, addressing needs in telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation.

Method: The study compares performance between video-based 3D pose estimation models (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose, NVIDIA BodyTrack) and IMU-based kinematics derived from OpenSim inverse kinematics using data from the VIDIMU dataset.

Result: MotionAGFormer outperformed other methods, achieving lowest RMSE (9.27° ± 4.80°), MAE (7.86° ± 4.18°), highest Pearson correlation (0.86 ± 0.15), and R² (0.67 ± 0.28). Both video- and sensor-based approaches proved viable but highlighted trade-offs in cost, accessibility, and precision.

Conclusion: The study underscores the promise of video-based kinematic assessments for healthy adults while providing insights into the limitations compared to IMU-based methods, offering guidance for designing future telehealth solutions.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuroSwift, a novel method for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity using enhanced adapters and diffusion techniques, achieving superior cross-subject performance with minimal training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how visual information is encoded in the brain and overcoming challenges posed by inter-subject variability in neural representations.

Method: NeuroSwift integrates complementary adapters (AutoKL and CLIP) using diffusion techniques, with CLIP trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images. Cross-subject fine-tuning is achieved by pretraining on one subject and minimally adjusting parameters for new subjects.

Result: NeuroSwift delivers state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy while requiring only one hour of training per subject on accessible GPUs, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses inter-subject variability in visual encoding, enabling accurate and efficient reconstruction of visual stimuli across individuals using lightweight computational resources.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces microCLIP, a framework improving CLIP-based vision-language models for fine-grained image classification, achieving 2.90% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of CLIP in fine-grained image classification due to its reliance on coarse global features.

Method: The method involves Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) in a TokenFusion module for feature enhancement, a two-headed classifier for stable adaptation, and Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation for iterative pseudo-label refinement.

Result: The approach achieved a consistent 2.90% improvement in accuracy across 13 fine-grained classification tasks with minimal adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed microCLIP framework successfully refines CLIP for better performance in fine-grained classification tasks using local cues with efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Method: VidGuard-R1 combines a challenging curated dataset of AI-generated and real videos with a novel fine-tuning approach, GRPO, and specialized reward models targeting temporal artifacts and complexity.

Result: VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot detection performance and accuracy above 95% after training, with precise and interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Through VidGuard-R1, the paper introduces a novel approach to detect video authenticity while providing insights to improve transparency for users and regulators.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes an effective method to overcome quality issues in long-horizon video generation using diffusion models, avoiding reliance on long-video training datasets and teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at visual generation but struggle with computational costs and quality issues when extending to long videos.

Method: The approach leverages self-generated video segments for guidance, maintaining consistency without retraining or overlapping frame computations.

Result: The method scales video length up to 20x the teacher's capability, enabling generation of 4 minutes and 15 seconds videos with significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed technique substantially improves fidelity and temporal consistency in long-horizon video generation, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon

TL;DR: KineMask is a physics-guided video generation model focusing on realistic object motions and interactions using a two-stage training strategy for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current video generation models in producing physically grounded object interactions and motion control.

Method: A two-stage training strategy for video diffusion models using object masks to progressively remove future motion supervision. Integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning.

Result: Significant improvement in realistic object interactions for synthetic and real scenes, along with strong performance over similarly sized models.

Conclusion: KineMask successfully enhances video generation capabilities, particularly for realistic physics-based object interactions, and its resources will be made available to the community.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

### [214] [MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287)
*Yichen Li,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for fine-grained multimodal actions to improve control in household robots using various sensory modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Household robots require precise motor control for delicate and urgent tasks, which current video models struggle to achieve.

Method: The authors introduce a feature learning paradigm for multiple sensory modalities and propose regularization techniques to improve causality in action trajectory representation.

Result: Experiments show improved simulation accuracy and reduced temporal drift, and ablation studies confirm the approach's validity.

Conclusion: Multimodal senses are effective in enhancing fine-grained control and are practical for real-world applications in robotics.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

*Enxin Song,Wenhao Chai,Shusheng Yang,Ethan Armand,Xiaojun Shan,Haiyang Xu,Jianwen Xie,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoNSA, a Video-Language Model adaptation using Native Sparse Attention (NSA) for improved long-video understanding and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of multimodal language models in understanding videos due to short context length and lack of coherence over long time scales.

Method: VideoNSA applies NSA selectively on video data while preserving dense attention for text, achieving scalability and better coherence through end-to-end training on a large video instruction dataset.

Result: Improved performance in long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, spatial benchmarks, and scalability up to 128K tokens.

Conclusion: VideoNSA optimizes attention allocation to enhance video language model functionality, highlighted by findings on dynamic attention mechanisms and scalability for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

### [216] [NoiseShift: Resolution-Aware Noise Recalibration for Better Low-Resolution Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02307)
*Ruozhen He,Moayed Haji-Ali,Ziyan Yang,Vicente Ordonez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called NoiseShift to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models at generating low-resolution images, enhancing quality and removing resolution-dependent artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a limitation in text-to-image diffusion models, where they struggle to generalize at resolutions lower than those seen during training. This discrepancy results in suboptimal performance and train-test mismatches in low-resolution settings.

Method: NoiseShift, a training-free method, recalibrates the noise level in the denoiser based on resolution size. This approach requires no changes to the model architecture or sampling schedule and is compatible with existing models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in image generation quality at lower resolutions. For instance, on LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves the FID score of Stable Diffusion 3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44%. On CelebA, improvements are 10.36% for SD3.5, 5.19% for SD3, and 3.02% for Flux-Dev.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively reduces resolution-dependent artifacts in text-to-image diffusion models, enhancing their performance for generating low-resolution images without requiring architectural modifications.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

*Guanqi Zhan,Xianzheng Ma,Weidi Xie,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the prediction of dynamic physical properties from videos, introducing datasets for bouncing objects, flowing liquids, and sliding objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to predict physical properties requiring temporal information: elasticity, viscosity, and dynamic friction.

Method: Three methods are used: a classical oracle approach, visual prompts on video models, and prompting strategies for MLLMs.

Result: Video foundation models perform similarly but below oracle methods, while MLLMs show scope for improvement via prompting.

Conclusion: Video models trained generatively or self-supervised can predict dynamic physical properties, but they trail traditional approaches; MLLMs perform worse but are improvable.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to identify objects involved in everyday sound-producing interactions using egocentric videos and segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate a model's ability to relate sounds to the specific objects involved, inspired by human perception.

Method: It employs an object-aware framework with attention-based visual encoders and segmentation masks from egocentric videos.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in sounding object detection and multimodal action understanding.

Conclusion: The approach effectively links object interactions to their associated sounds, showcasing strong performance in object-sound detection.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) against image-level poisoning attacks and proposes a density-guided poisoning attack method to exploit vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of 3D representation methods like NeRF and 3DGS, which are increasingly important in view synthesis.

Method: Introduces a density-guided poisoning method injecting Gaussian points in low-density regions using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and incorporates adaptive noise strategies to disrupt multi-view consistency.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art poisoning techniques in systematically diminishing robustness of 3DGS while maintaining stealth.

Conclusion: The approach successfully exploits weaknesses in 3DGS and provides a robust evaluation protocol, paving the way for objective benchmarking in this area of research.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### [220] [Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02315)
*Eric Tillmann Bill,Enis Simsar,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of improving text-to-image models' performance in handling multi-subject prompts and introduces techniques to enhance subject disentanglement using control-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail in scenarios involving prompts with multiple subjects due to issues such as attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions.

Method: The paper formulates a theoretical framework using stochastic optimal control (SOC) over flow matching samplers and proposes two algorithms: a training-free test-time controller and Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning method.

Result: Empirical tests on models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL show improved multi-subject alignment while preserving base styles. The algorithms run efficiently and generalize well to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed FOCUS method achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in multi-subject text-to-image generation, offering an effective solution for disentangling subjects in such models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

*Preston Vander Vos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Odontoceti, a DAG-based protocol, achieves fast blockchain transaction processing with 20% fault tolerance, offering low latency (300 ms) and high throughput (10,000 tps) while operating in realistic network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues in blockchains by reducing latency and improving transaction throughput, even if it requires reducing fault tolerance to 20%.

Method: Developed Odontoceti, a DAG-based consensus protocol that achieves commitment in two communication rounds with an uncertified DAG and a novel block-commitment decision rule, optimized for crash fault scenarios.

Result: Evaluations show a 20-25% latency improvement over production-grade protocols, processing 10,000 transactions per second with median latency of 300 milliseconds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the practical feasibility of reducing fault tolerance to improve blockchain scalability and performance under common crash fault conditions.

Abstract: Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and
immediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based
consensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high
throughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20%
fault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based
protocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering
median latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per
second under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1
validators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for
committing blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress
when participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more
common in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25%
latency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating
that reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful
performance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower
fault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for handling large-scale LLM training and inference workloads is outpacing the capabilities of traditional scheduling systems, necessitating innovative solutions for resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality.

Method: Kant employs co-scheduling strategies for training and inference jobs, leveraging methods such as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack. It defines key metrics like GPU Allocation Ratio, Scheduling Occupancy Rate, and others for performance evaluation.

Result: Experimental results reveal exceptional performance across clusters of varying GPU sizes, significantly enhancing resource utilization and scheduling efficiency while minimizing fragmentation and communication overhead.

Conclusion: Kant proves to be a highly effective engineering solution for constructing robust AI-native scheduling infrastructures for large clusters, already deployed and operational in multiple data centers.

Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for
large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly,
traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing
resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper
presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed
for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both
training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant
system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI
clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate
(SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution
(JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a
foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results
demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from
hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such
as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves
resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing
resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The
system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably
supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a
practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available,
AI-native scheduling infrastructure.

Result: IoT-MCP achieved a 100% success rate in executing tasks, with efficient performance metrics: 205ms average response time and a 74KB memory footprint.

Conclusion: IoT-MCP enables seamless communication between LLMs and IoT systems, offering an open-source framework and evaluation tools for advancing LLM-IoT integration.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT)
systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control
complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a critical enabler,
providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We
propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed

introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g.,
``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel
so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation
across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100%

*Hasan Heydari,Alysson Bessani,Kartik Nayak*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: QScale introduces a distributed ledger protocol optimized for moderate-scale systems, achieving sub-linear communication complexity per process and low finalization latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protocols struggle with balancing communication complexity and performance in systems with hundreds to a thousand processes, which are common in production.

Method: QScale uses a protocol that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication complexity per process, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total complexity, and $O(\kappa)$ best-case latency while ensuring safety and liveness.

Result: QScale achieves efficient communication and fast block finalization for moderate-scale distributed ledgers, providing practicality for real-world use cases.

Conclusion: The proposed QScale protocol effectively addresses the efficiency challenges posed by moderate-scale systems while maintaining security guarantees.

Abstract: Existing distributed ledger protocols either incur a high communication
complexity and are thus suited to systems with a small number of processes
(e.g., PBFT), or rely on committee-sampling-based approaches that only work for
a very large number of processes (e.g., Algorand). Neither of these lines of
work is well-suited for moderate-scale distributed ledgers ranging from a few
hundred to a thousand processes, which are common in production (e.g, Redbelly,
Sui). The goal of this work is to design a distributed ledger with sub-linear
communication complexity per process, sub-quadratic total communication
complexity, and low latency for finalizing a block into the ledger, such that
it can be used for moderate-scale systems. We propose QScale, a protocol in
which every process incurs only $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication
complexity per-block in expectation, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total
communication complexity per-block in expectation, and a best-case latency of
$O(\kappa)$ rounds while ensuring safety and liveness with overwhelming
probability, with $\kappa$ being a small security parameter.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scheduling algorithm for low-latency DNN offloading on mobile edge devices with mechanisms like dynamic bandwidth estimation to enhance performance and task throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-latency and deadline-constrained DNN offloading on mobile edge devices while handling factors such as device availability, network communication, and resource scarcity.

Method: The authors designed a scheduling algorithm with lightweight resource representation, network discretization, and dynamic bandwidth estimation, and implemented it on Raspberry Pi 2 devices for waste classification.

Result: The proposed solution outperforms prior scheduling methods, showing better performance under high workloads and improved task throughput during resource scarcity.

Conclusion: The novel abstraction models for low-latency offloading and dynamic bandwidth estimation contribute to enhanced scheduling efficiency in constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for low-latency deadline-constrained DNN
offloading on mobile edge devices. We design a scheduling algorithm with
lightweight network state representation, considering device availability,
communication on the network link, priority-aware pre-emption, and task
deadlines. The scheduling algorithm aims to reduce latency by designing a
resource availability representation, as well as a network discretisation and a
dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism. We implement the scheduling algorithm
into a system composed of four Raspberry Pi 2 (model Bs) mobile edge devices,
sampling a waste classification conveyor belt at a set frame rate. The system
is evaluated and compared to a previous approach of ours, which was proven to
outcompete work-stealers and a non-pre-emption based scheduling heuristic under
the aforementioned waste classification scenario. Our findings show the novel
lower latency abstraction models yield better performance under high-volume
workloads, with the dynamic bandwidth estimation assisting the task placement
while, ultimately, increasing task throughput in times of resource scarcity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to utilize emerging RISC-V accelerators for HPC workloads while preserving legacy Fortran scientific codes, avoiding extensive rewriting.

Method: The authors propose an approach to interface Fortran with RISC-V based architectures, bypassing the necessity for bespoke programming models and APIs.

Result: The approach shows potential to effectively enable Fortran-driven use of RISC-V accelerators for scientific computing.

Conclusion: This work could facilitate the adoption of RISC-V accelerators in HPC environments without forcing the rewriting of complex Fortran codebases.

Abstract: A range of RISC-V based accelerators are available and coming to market, and
there is strong potential for these to be used for High Performance Computing
(HPC) workloads. However, such accelerators tend to provide bespoke programming
models and APIs that require codes to be rewritten. In scientific computing,
where many of the simulation code are highly complex, extensive, and written in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of traditional DFT-based MD simulations, which restricts the feasibility of long-term simulations.

Method: Proposed a time-series forecasting model that predicts atomic trajectories using displacements. It employs a physics-informed loss guided by DFT-based Morse potential functions, enforcing physical plausibility and penalizing unphysical atomic distances.

Result: The method outperforms standard baselines in simulation accuracy across a range of materials and achieves stable modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, physics-informed alternative to computationally expensive DFT simulations, enhancing the reliability and speed of MD simulations.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

### [228] [Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01218)
*Sergey Troshin,Wafaa Mohammed,Yan Meng,Christof Monz,Antske Fokkens,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called selective sampling to balance the trade-off between diversity and precision in language model outputs by dynamically adjusting the sampling method based on a risk metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to address the issue of maintaining both diversity and precision in the outputs of language models, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning where high precision is critical and standard high-temperature sampling degrades performance.

Method: Selective sampling dynamically switches between greedy decoding and high-temperature sampling depending on a sampling risk metric, which predicts the likelihood of errors. A lightweight classifier is trained on a small dataset to estimate this risk.

Result: Selective sampling improves the quality-diversity trade-off in mathematical reasoning tasks, even in high-temperature sampling scenarios, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed selective sampling method allows language models to achieve better performance by effectively managing when to prioritize precision over diversity or vice versa.

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of materials is inhibited by the lack of extensive, machine-readable datasets that integrate performance metrics with structural context. Experimental literature is underutilized, necessitating a scalable solution.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-driven pipeline integrating dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to autonomously extract data from about 10,000 scientific articles. They benchmarked models, particularly GPT-4.1, for accuracy and cost-efficiency.

Result: The pipeline extracted 27,822 temperature-resolved thermoelectric property records, including metrics like ZT, Seebeck coefficient, and structural attributes. The workflow confirmed known thermoelectric trends and identified broader structure-property correlations.

Conclusion: The study offers a reproducible, scalable, and cost-effective pipeline to autonomously extract materials data, creating a foundation for future data-driven material discovery and releasing tools for community use.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [230] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ is introduced to improve extremely low-bit quantization for large language models, achieving better results in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) with high parameter counts on resource-limited devices by improving quantization methods.

Method: RSAVQ introduces Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG) to suppress error expansion using a Riemannian metric and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) for optimal bit resource allocation through channel-wise sensitivity analysis.

Result: Experiments show RSAVQ outperforms existing methods in 2-bit quantization. For instance, it improves LLaMA-3 8B's perplexity by 0.4 and zero-shot accuracy by 1.5 over baselines.

Conclusion: RSAVQ provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for efficient LLM quantization, making it viable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses federated learning's vulnerability to poisoning and backdoor attacks under partial observability by introducing a trust-aware Deep Q-Network, achieving an optimal robustness-accuracy balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning systems face significant risks from poisoning and backdoor attacks, especially when client observability is limited, necessitating a secure and efficient defense mechanism.

Method: The authors use a trust-aware Deep Q-Network to manage client trust updates and optimize the trade-off between robustness and accuracy across long-term decision-making processes.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 reveal improved accuracy, reduced attack success rates with increased client overlap, steady accuracy despite reduced observability, and DQN surpassing alternative controllers in robustness-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Sequential belief updates via DQN effectively address poisoning risks in federated learning under partial observability, achieving superior performance in safeguarding model accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

*Koyena Chowdhury,Paramita Koley,Abhijnan Chakraborty,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSTGCN, a model for forecasting average arrival delays at railway stations in India, supported by a newly curated dataset. It shows improved predictive performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve train delay prediction for enhanced railway operations, expanding focus to station-level delay prediction for improved traffic management.

Method: RSTGCN leverages spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks, integrates train-frequency aware spatial attention, and uses a curated dataset of the Indian Railway Network.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate RSTGCN’s consistent improvements in delay prediction metrics compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: RSTGCN advances station-level delay prediction in large-scale rail networks and introduces an open dataset for extended research in railway traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

*Jacob J. W. Bakermans,Pablo Tano,Reidar Riveland,Charles Findling,Alexandre Pouget*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model for compositional meta-learning using generative models to efficiently solve new tasks by reusing knowledge from previous tasks through probabilistic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable rapid learning of new tasks by reusing structured knowledge from previous experiences, aiming for data-efficient task solving.

Method: The method involves creating a generative model to represent tasks as combinations of reusable computations and treating learning new tasks as probabilistic inference without needing parameter updates.

Result: The model effectively recovered task components and statistics in rule and motor learning tasks and demonstrated the ability to infer new solutions from a single example.

Conclusion: The framework combines neural network expressivity and probabilistic inference for efficient and quick compositional meta-learning, achieving promising results in task generalization and data efficiency.

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

### [234] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Budgeted Broadcast (BB), a pruning method that balances selectivity and audience through traffic budgets, improving coding entropy and decorrelation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods focus on ranking parameters by their impact on loss, often neglecting broader representation efficiency.

Method: The BB method assigns local traffic budgets to each unit based on long-term on-rate and fan-out, utilizing constrained-entropy analysis to enforce selectivity-audience balance.

Result: BB improves coding entropy, decorrelation, accuracy across diverse model scenarios, and achieves state-of-the-art results on electron microscopy image analysis.

Conclusion: BB is effective in learning diverse, efficient representations, surpassing dense baselines in some cases and is globally applicable across models.

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

### [235] [TetriServe: Efficient DiT Serving for Heterogeneous Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01565)
*Runyu Lu,Shiqi He,Wenxuan Tan,Shenggui Li,Ruofan Wu,Jeff J. Ma,Ang Chen,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TetriServe introduces step-level sequence parallelism to optimize GPU utilization and improve Service Level Objective (SLO) attainment in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) serving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights inefficiencies in existing DiT serving systems for high-resolution image generation, particularly in handling heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines under strict SLOs.

Method: The authors propose step-level sequence parallelism and implement it in TetriServe, which uses a round-based scheduling mechanism to dynamically adjust parallelism based on request deadlines and optimize GPU usage.

Result: TetriServe demonstrated up to 32% better SLO attainment compared to existing solutions, while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed TetriServe system significantly improves efficiency and deadline adherence in high-quality image generation tasks using DiT models, addressing key limitations in current serving approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: The paper presents an extended IsaacLab framework for scalable training of adversarial policies in physics simulations, introducing adversarial MARL environments with heterogeneous agents and goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address adversarial interactions in MARL, which are crucial for applications such as pursuit-evasion and competitive manipulation in dynamic environments.

Method: It introduces a competitive variant of HAPPO integrated into the IsaacLab framework, enabling scalable training and evaluation of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.

Result: The framework demonstrates robust policy training for morphologically diverse agents in adversarial scenarios, ensuring high throughput and realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The study establishes a reliable platform for modeling and training adversarial multi-agent systems, providing valuable benchmarks and tools for further research.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for

manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

### [237] [RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265)
*Ali Hatamizadeh,Syeda Nahida Akter,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Jan Kautz,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLP, a reinforcement learning-based pretraining objective for reasoning models that uses information gain from chain-of-thought exploration as a reward signal, improving performance in reasoning-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions whether the traditional method of using reinforcement learning only at the post-training phase is optimal for training reasoning models.

Method: The proposed RLP method introduces reinforcement learning during pretraining by treating chain-of-thought reasoning as an action and using information gain to compute rewards, enabling independent reasoning earlier in training.

Result: Applying RLP improved performance on reasoning-heavy benchmarks like AIME25 and increased average accuracy for various models, including Qwen3-1.7B and Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2, demonstrating effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: RLP bridges the gap between traditional next-token prediction and reasoning by introducing independent thinking during pretraining, resulting in enhanced reasoning capabilities across tasks and architectures.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

### [238] [Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269)
*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid control framework combining Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) to safely mitigate structural vibrations without needing explicit system models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based vibration control strategies like LQR require accurate and tedious system modeling, while model-free RL methods eliminate this need but pose risks during their random exploratory training phase.

Method: A hybrid framework where an LQR controller, derived from a randomly selected and inaccurate model, safely guides the training of a model-free RL controller on physical systems.

Result: The proposed hybrid control strategy addresses the training safety challenges of RL in vibration control and minimizes structural harm during the training phase.

Conclusion: This approach ensures vibration mitigation without relying on precise system models, offering a verified solution to RL's safety challenges during training and advancing vibration control innovation.

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic method to identify key nodes, termed "information relays," in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), improving interpretability and network design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNNs are often viewed as black-box models, making their internal mechanisms difficult to interpret. The study seeks to improve understanding and design of RNNs by identifying key information-transfer nodes.

Method: The authors develop a methodology that uses mutual information to locate "information relays" in RNNs. The method is tested on synthetic and real-world time series tasks across multiple architectures (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs).

Result: The study identifies unique patterns of information relay in different RNN architectures. Node knockout experiments show the critical roles of these relays in influencing overall network behavior.

Conclusion: The findings provide a framework for better interpreting RNNs and designing more robust architectures, contributing to the field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NcPU is a PU learning framework addressing the challenge of discriminative representation by combining a robust supervised non-contrastive loss with a phantom label disambiguation scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art PU learning models perform poorly on complex datasets due to unreliable supervision, prompting the need for a method to effectively learn discriminative representations.

Method: NcPU introduces a non-contrastive PU learning framework combining NoiSNCL (a noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss) to align intra-class representations and PLD (phantom label disambiguation) for negative supervision using a regret-based update mechanism.

Result: Experiments show that NoiSNCL achieves competitive performance and NcPU outperforms state-of-the-art PU learning methods across a range of datasets, including post-disaster building damage mapping.

Conclusion: NcPU offers a robust framework for PU learning, achieving significant improvements in challenging real-world applications and reducing the performance gap with supervised methods.

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

*Rui Melo,Rui Abreu,Corina S. Pasareanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to detect misbehaviors in large language models (LLMs) by applying lightweight position encoding perturbations inspired by microsaccades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find an effective and efficient way to detect failures (e.g., toxicity, factuality issues) in LLMs without requiring fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.

Method: The method involves introducing lightweight position encoding perturbations to LLMs, which elicit latent signals that reveal misbehavior without modifying the models or requiring extensive resources.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed probing method detects failures such as factuality issues, safety concerns, toxicity, and backdoor attacks in multiple state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that pretrained LLMs already encode internal evidence of their failures, and microsaccade-inspired interventions are effective in surfacing and addressing these misbehaviors.

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

*Akshat Ramachandran,Marina Neseem,Charbel Sakr,Rangharajan Venkatesan,Brucek Khailany,Tushar Krishna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThinKV introduces a framework for compressing the key-value cache of large reasoning models to prevent memory overflow during extended chain of thought generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of key-value cache sizes during extended reasoning in large models causes GPU memory limitations, creating a need for efficient memory management.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy within a framework called ThinKV. It assigns precision levels based on thought importance and evicts less critical tokens. Additionally, it employs a newly designed kernel to recycle evicted memory slots efficiently.

Result: ThinKV reduces KV cache usage to less than 5% of its original capacity, maintaining nearly lossless accuracy, while offering up to 5.8x higher inference throughput compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ThinKV is a highly efficient and effective memory compression framework, enabling large reasoning models to maintain performance and accuracy without exceeding memory constraints.

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Xiaobo Ma,Hyunsoo Noh,James Tokishi,Ryan Hatch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a domain adaptation framework using a novel Gradient Boosting with Balanced Weighting (GBBW) model to improve vehicle delay estimation across diverse intersections, with better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for estimating vehicle delays struggle with variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver behavior, leading to poor generalization since they assume training and testing data have the same distribution.

Method: The framework involves dividing data into source and target domains, extracting traffic features, and refining the model with a small target domain dataset. GBBW reweights source data for improved adaptability to the target domain.

Result: The GBBW framework outperforms eight state-of-the-art ML models and seven other domain adaptation methods in accurately estimating delays, based on data from 57 intersections in Pima County, Arizona.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances traffic management applications by improving the transferability and robustness of machine learning models, aiding real-world traffic signal optimization and congestion handling.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

### [245] [Low Rank Gradients and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01303)
*Rishi Sonthalia,Michael Murray,Guido Montúfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores low-rank structures in gradients of two-layer neural networks under relaxed assumptions about data and parameters. It finds gradients to be approximately low rank and dominated by specific components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the gradient behavior in neural networks under relaxed isotropy assumptions on data and parameters, which is critical for improving neural network training efficiency.

Method: Analyzed gradients in two-layer neural networks using a spiked data model with relaxed assumptions. Considered both mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings, and examined the role of training regularizers through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: Gradients are dominated by two rank-one terms, influenced by bulk data-residue and spikes in the data. The balance of these components depends on data properties, scaling regime, and activation functions. Regularizers selectively influence these components.

Conclusion: Low-rank gradient structures are inherent in this setting. Certain data properties and regularizers can be leveraged to control or optimize training dynamics, as supported by experimental validation.

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

### [246] [Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335)
*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for Intrinsic Dimension Estimation (IDE) using a quantum-inspired approach, offering more complex manifolds for testing IDE accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Intrinsic Dimension Estimation (IDE) vary widely in performance and lack rigorous testing on complex manifolds, necessitating better benchmarking tools.

Method: The authors develop the QuIIEst benchmark, inspired by quantum optical techniques, featuring infinite families of complex manifolds with known intrinsic dimensions.

Result: IDE methods tested on QuIIEst were less accurate compared to existing benchmarks, showing the difficulty of these manifolds; minimal degradation under curvature variation was observed.

Conclusion: The benchmark underscores challenges in IDE and highlights which methods perform well on non-manifold spaces like the Hofstadter's butterfly.

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance of the LAPO framework in discovering representations of actions from video data and address its statistical benefits and challenges.

Method: The study introduces desiderata for action representations, describes sources of unidentifiability, and proves the effectiveness of entropy-regularized LAPO objectives under specific conditions.

Result: Entropy-regularized LAPO objectives successfully identify action representations that align with desired properties, demonstrating a sound statistical framework for the task.

Conclusion: Discrete action representations are effective in practice, supported by theoretical analysis of the LAPO framework.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

### [248] [Self-Supervised Representation Learning as Mutual Information Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01345)
*Akhlaqur Rahman Sabby,Yi Sui,Tongzi Wu,Jesse C. Cresswell,Ga Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) by analyzing its theoretical underpinnings, proposing two paradigms (SDMI and JMI), and explaining architectural choices in SSRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the fundamental principles behind SSRL methods, which have shown empirical success but lack theoretical understanding, and to move beyond heuristics and empirically motivated designs.

Method: The paper starts with a variational mutual information lower bound to derive two training paradigms—Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI). SDMI employs alternating optimization with stop-gradient operations, while JMI uses symmetric architectures for joint optimization, introducing key structural constraints.

Result: It connects the two paradigms (SDMI and JMI) to existing SSRL methods, showing that these methods are specific cases or approximations of the paradigms. Predictor networks and statistical regularizers are shown to be theoretically grounded components.

Conclusion: The research establishes a solid theoretical basis for the architectural components and optimization choices in SSRL methods, helping to explain them beyond heuristic or empirical reasoning.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

### [249] [To Augment or Not to Augment? Diagnosing Distributional Symmetry Breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01349)
*Hannah Lawrence,Elyssa Hofgard,Vasco Portilheiro,Yuxuan Chen,Tess Smidt,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines symmetry-aware machine learning methods and introduces a metric to evaluate assumptions about symmetry-breaking in datasets. The study tests this on synthetic datasets and point cloud benchmarks, revealing insights into the impact of anisotropy on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the assumption that transformed datapoints are crucial under the test distribution, which affects the efficacy of symmetry-aware techniques like data augmentation and equivariant architectures.

Method: A new metric based on a two-sample neural classifier test is introduced to measure symmetry-breaking in datasets, validated on synthetic datasets and analyzed on point cloud benchmarks.

Result: The metric uncovered significant anisotropy in point cloud datasets and showed that symmetry-breaking can hinder invariant methods from optimal performance, although the impact varies across datasets.

Conclusion: Rethinking symmetry biases in data is essential to fully understand the efficacy of equivariant methods and their dataset-dependent implications.

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

### [250] [RheOFormer: A generative transformer model for simulation of complex fluids and flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01365)
*Maedeh Saberi,Amir Barati Farimani,Safa Jamali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study presents Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative method for modeling soft material mechanics under flowing conditions, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for modeling non-Newtonian fluid dynamics face difficulties due to computational inefficiencies and lack of scalability, and current data-driven methods require frequent retraining for varying physical conditions.

Method: The proposed RheOFormer uses self-attention mechanisms in a generative operator learning framework to efficiently model and predict the nonlinear mechanics and flow behavior of complex fluids.

Result: RheOFormer accurately learns and predicts the mechanics and flow evolution of various complex fluids across diverse conditions and domains, with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: RheOFormer is a computationally efficient neural surrogate that enables advanced simulations, experimentation, and process optimization for complex fluid mechanics.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

*Kiwhan Song,Jaeyeon Kim,Sitan Chen,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how diffusion models selectively underfit the score function in certain input regions, rather than uniformly, to improve generalization and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsolved question of how diffusion models avoid merely reproducing training data and instead generate novel samples.

Method: They introduced the concept of 'selective underfitting' in score matching and provided empirical validations to support this refined perspective.

Result: Demonstrated that selective underfitting is essential for improving the generalization and sample generation capabilities of diffusion models.

Conclusion: Selective underfitting offers new insights into the functioning of diffusion models and lays a foundation for better understanding and improving their generative performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

*Jaeyeon Kim,Seunggeun Kim,Taekyun Lee,David Z. Pan,Hyeji Kim,Sham Kakade,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a plug-in method for enabling self-correction in pretrained Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), improving performance across several tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the self-correction capabilities of Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) without requiring significant architectural changes or reliance on imprecise token quality measures.

Method: The PRISM approach defines a self-correction loss for learning per-token quality scores during inference in MDMs, without requiring reinforcement learning or external verifiers.

Result: PRISM effectively detects low-quality tokens and enhances performance in multiple domains, including Sudoku, text generation, and code generation using various model scales.

Conclusion: The PRISM method serves as a lightweight, model-agnostic solution that significantly improves MDM inference capabilities, making it widely applicable.

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for optimizing inference-time generation in large language models using algorithms inspired by the Pandora's Box problem and introduces methods for adaptive strategies that improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance output quality and generation cost in large language models, especially when multiple generations are involved.

Method: The paper adapts classical Pandora's Box algorithms to decide optimal stopping thresholds without knowing reward distributions and introduces practical adjustments like reward normalization using Bradley-Terry transformations.

Result: Experiments show up to 15-35% fewer generations required compared to non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling, maintaining equivalent performance.

Conclusion: The work bridges optimal stopping theory with practical inference-time scaling and offers both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency improvements in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based framework for free energy reconstruction that eliminates the need for analytical Jacobians, enabling the inclusion of complex or machine-learned collective variables (CVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methods for free energy reconstruction, such as GPR, are limited by the requirement of Jacobians for CVs, particularly when dealing with complex or machine-learned CVs.

Method: The authors propose a neural network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates, using automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians and eliminate the need for analytical forms.

Result: The framework demonstrated high accuracy in predicting both simple and complex CVs in an MgCl2 ion-pairing system. It also showed that Jacobian errors follow a near-Gaussian distribution, making them compatible with GPR methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables gradient-based free energy techniques to handle complex and machine-learned CVs, expanding the possibilities for simulations in biochemistry and materials science.

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses adversarially robust classification for multiclass settings under various loss functions and introduces dual and barycentric reformulations to calculate robust risks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies for adversarially robust classification largely focus on the 0-1 loss setting, leaving a gap in extending the results to other loss functions such as cross-entropy, quadratic loss, etc.

Method: The authors derive dual and barycentric formulations of adversarial risk minimization and explore connections with problems like $
alpha$-fair packing and generalized barycenters.

Result: The proposed methods enable the computation of sharper lower bounds for adversarial risks, particularly improving results for models using cross-entropy loss.

Conclusion: Their approach broadens the scope of adversarial robustness to include a wider array of loss functions and introduces efficient computational tools for analyzing these risks.

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of high computational costs and complexity in convolution-based decoders for neural image compression methods.

Method: The authors integrate low-rank representation into an autoencoder with vector quantization, leveraging efficient low-rank operations on the latent image representations.

Result: The proposed method significantly lowers the computational demands during data reconstruction and maintains high-quality image output.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising solution to remove the decoder compute bottleneck in neural image compression, achieving efficient and high-quality reconstruction.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

*Benjamin Wiriyapong,Oktay Karakuş,Kirill Sidorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Mixture Flow Variational Inference (AMF-VI), which combines different flow models to consistently approximate various complex posterior distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-flow variational inference methods struggle to perform consistently across diverse posterior families with varied shapes and modalities.

Method: AMF-VI involves training multiple complementary flows sequentially and using likelihood-driven updates to adaptively estimate global weights, ensuring efficient architecture-agnostic operation.

Result: AMF-VI achieves lower negative log-likelihood and improved robustness metrics (Wasserstein-2, MDD) across different posterior families compared to single-flow models.

Conclusion: AMF-VI demonstrates its superiority by delivering stable and robust variational inference across diverse posterior families while preserving the unique strengths of individual flow models.

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PPGen, a biophysical model to improve the interpretability of PPG signals and proposes a hybrid amortized inference method (HAI) for robust parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to reconcile the tension between predictive power and clinical interpretability in deep learning models that rely on photoplethysmography (PPG) while also addressing sensor design considerations.

Method: The authors introduce PPGen, a biophysical model that connects PPG signals to interpretable physiological parameters. They also propose a novel hybrid amortized inference (HAI) method for improved parameter estimation, even under diverse environmental challenges.

Result: Through extensive in-silico tests, HAI demonstrated accurate inference of physiological parameters across varied noise and sensor conditions, making it a robust approach.

Conclusion: PPGen and HAI pave the way for PPG models that balance deep learning predictive power, clinical interpretability, and improved sensor design, potentially elevating the utility of wearable healthcare devices.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

### [260] [SoftAdaClip: A Smooth Clipping Strategy for Fair and Private Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01447)
*Dorsa Soleymani,Ali Dadsetan,Frank Rudzicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoftAdaClip, a training method that replaces hard clipping in DP-SGD with a tanh-based transformation to improve fairness and preserve gradient magnitudes, demonstrating reduced subgroup disparities across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differential privacy often reduces fairness and model performance for underrepresented groups, largely due to uniform hard clipping mechanisms in DP-SGD.

Method: A novel method SoftAdaClip is proposed, using a smooth, tanh-based transformation to replace hard clipping, enhancing fairness while maintaining differential privacy.

Result: SoftAdaClip demonstrates up to 87% reduction in subgroup disparities compared to DP-SGD and 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD across multiple datasets, with statistically significant results.

Conclusion: SoftAdaClip is a significant advancement that integrates smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms for fair and private model training, addressing fairness concerns in differentially private methods.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

### [261] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework achieving precise recall control for large-scale spatial conflation and entity-matching tasks with low variance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise recall control is necessary for large-scale tasks to minimize both missed matches—which could disrupt analytics—and excessive manual verification efforts.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline starting with bounding-box filtering and sparse representations, a lightweight neural ranker, and ensemble threshold estimators aggregating multiple techniques for recall calibration.

Result: The framework consistently hits recall targets with low error and decreases redundant matches when evaluated on cadastral datasets of millions of pairs.

Conclusion: This method provides reliable, efficient recall control with low variance, making it suitable for computationally-intensive spatial conflation problems.

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

*Yifei Zuo,Yutong Yin,Zhichen Zeng,Ang Li,Banghua Zhu,Zhaoran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Linear Attention (LLA), a new theoretical-based attention mechanism designed to enhance expressiveness, adapt to non-stationarity, and outperform existing methods, even though it comes with higher computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underexplored area of developing more expressive attention mechanisms, grounded in theory, to complement or improve upon widely studied efficient Softmax Attention alternatives.

Method: The authors developed LLA by employing concepts from nonparametric statistics and test-time regression. They analyzed its theoretical advantages using bias-variance trade-off and created hardware-efficient, scalable algorithms (FlashLLA) to mitigate computational challenges.

Result: LLA demonstrated empirical success in tasks such as associative recall, state tracking, and test-time/in-context regression. It outperformed strong baselines, especially in adapting to non-stationary data, while being scalable for large-scale models.

Conclusion: LLA provides a theoretically superior attention mechanism that balances expressiveness and computational efficiency, showing promise for diverse applications and large-scale models.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

### [263] [Reinforcement Learning with Action-Triggered Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02149)
*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs) to address reinforcement learning scenarios where state observations occur stochastically based on actions, providing both theoretical and algorithmic advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle real-world reinforcement learning problems where state observations are not consistently available but instead stochastically triggered based on actions.

Method: Formulated the ATST-MDP framework, derived specialized Bellman equations, proposed the concept of action-sequence learning, and introduced the ST-LSVI-UCB algorithm optimized for action-triggered scenarios.

Result: The proposed ST-LSVI-UCB algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of learning in sporadically observed settings.

Conclusion: Learning in environments with sporadic, action-based observations is both theoretically viable and computationally efficient, supported by the ATST-MDP framework and the ST-LSVI-UCB algorithm.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

*Brett Barkley,Preston Culbertson,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPED, a fast and effective OOD detection method for diffusion models that reduces computational cost significantly while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and reliable OOD detection in machine learning systems for various applications such as vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning.

Method: SCOPED combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a test statistic and leverages kernel density estimation for flexible, unsupervised OOD detection, requiring minimal computational resources.

Result: SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores on four vision benchmarks and generalizes well to robotic control tasks, offering reliable performance at low computational cost.

Conclusion: SCOPED establishes itself as a practical and efficient method for OOD detection across a range of real-world applications, reducing computational demands without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

*Stefano Bruno,Youngsik Hwang,Jaehyeon An,Sotirios Sabanis,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), an optimization method aimed at achieving flat minima for better generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve generalization in deep learning by addressing the lack of mechanisms in classical SGLD for biasing toward flat loss landscape solutions.

Method: The fSGLD combines stochastic gradients with isotropic Gaussian noise perturbations (Random Weight Perturbation), optimizing an implicit curvature-aware smoothing objective. Theoretical guarantees are derived on its behavior and convergence.

Result: fSGLD is shown to achieve superior or comparable generalization and robustness to benchmarks, demonstrated through experiments on noisy-label and vision tasks, with significantly flatter minima.

Conclusion: Flat minima can be efficiently attained with fSGLD, delivering advantages in generalization and robustness with lower computational costs compared to alternatives like SAM.

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

### [266] [Fixing That Free Lunch: When, Where, and Why Synthetic Data Fails in Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01457)
*Brett Barkley,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes why synthetic data in model-based reinforcement learning sometimes fails and proposes solutions to improve the MBPO algorithm, demonstrating enhanced policy performance in new scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning algorithms like MBPO often underperform in certain environments despite showing strong results elsewhere. The motivation is to identify and address the limitations so that model-based approaches can robustly outperform model-free alternatives.

Method: The study examines MBPO failures in the DeepMind Control Suite. The authors identify two key issues—scale mismatches between models causing critic underestimation and poor target representations leading to variance inflation—and propose adjustments to solve these problems.

Result: The improved MBPO algorithm outperforms SAC in 5 out of 7 DMC tasks while preserving its earlier high performance in the OpenAI Gym benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing failure modes in synthetic data usage, this work re-establishes MBPO as a strong contender and highlights the need to connect task-specific structures to algorithmic performance to ensure generalization.

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

### [267] [Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216)
*Zeqi Ye,Minshuo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for time-series imputation, addressing gaps in understanding their statistical performance and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve understanding of how diffusion-based models capture spatial and temporal dependencies in missing time-series data, especially since these models have shown empirical success but lack theoretical backing.

Method: The authors derive statistical sample complexity bounds via a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers and propose a mixed-masking training strategy.

Result: The paper identifies bounds for statistical efficiency, constructs confidence regions for missing values, and finds that imputation performance depends on the missing data patterns. Simulations validate these findings.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion transformers can theoretically and empirically improve the accuracy and uncertainty quantification in time-series imputation; missing patterns play a pivotal role in performance.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

### [268] [How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458)
*Shawn Im,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of noisy human feedback on training large language models, offering analyses and guarantees under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unrealistic assumption of noise-free feedback in the preference optimization process of aligning language models with human preferences.

Method: Introduce a framework to analyze generalization under noisy feedback, focusing on realistic noise sources and finite-step optimization in preference learning.

Result: Findings reveal how generalization performance decays with noise types and rates, validated empirically on contemporary LLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and practical guidelines for improving alignment methods in noisy human feedback settings, enabling more robust AI systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a copula-based method to generate more accurate and correlated multi-step time series sample paths, which is faster than traditional autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and error propagation challenges in generating multi-step forecast trajectories with realistic correlations in time series applications.

Method: The authors propose a copula-based approach that integrates with existing multi-step time series models to create correlated sample paths in a single forward pass, avoiding iterative autoregressive sampling.

Result: The copula-based method is significantly faster than autoregressive sampling and provides higher-quality sample paths by reducing snowballing errors.

Conclusion: The proposed copula-based solution enhances efficiency and accuracy in generating multi-step time series forecasts with realistic correlation structures, making it a valuable alternative to autoregressive sampling.

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel algorithm enhancing reinforcement learning for large language models by dynamically selecting training data based on response length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address efficiency issues in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks and investigate how overthinking in LLMs may affect learning processes.

Method: The authors propose LSPO, a meta-RLVR algorithm that adapts training data sampling based on average response lengths at each step.

Result: LSPO improves learning effectiveness across various models and datasets, as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating response length into RLVR training enhances model performance, with LSPO offering promising directions for optimizing reinforcement learning methods further.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

*Kaja Gruntkowska,Yassine Maziane,Zheng Qu,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional approach of updating all layers during optimization in deep learning, proposing "Drop-Muon," a method that updates only a subset of layers per step using randomized scheduling. This approach achieves faster training with guaranteed convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the commonly held assumption in deep learning that updating the entire network per optimization step is optimal.

Method: Introduce a framework called Drop-Muon, which combines random layer drop schedules with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates. Theoretical and empirical analysis are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.

Result: Drop-Muon provides rigorous convergence guarantees in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Empirically, it achieves the same accuracy up to 1.4 times faster than full-network Muon in CNN experiments.

Conclusion: Full-network updates may not be optimal. Drop-Muon represents a more efficient alternative for training large-scale models, offering both theoretical grounding and practical improvements.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stability-plasticity principle to address inconsistency in offline-to-online reinforcement learning, offering a framework validated by empirical study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistencies in empirical performance of design choices during online fine-tuning in RL necessitate better understanding and a unified principle.

Method: Proposes stability-plasticity principle, identifying three regimes of online fine-tuning with corresponding requirements, validated through a large-scale empirical study.

Result: Results show strong alignment with predictions in 45 out of 63 cases, demonstrating the framework's robustness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach for design choices in offline-to-online RL, emphasizing stability and plasticity based on relative offline dataset and pretrained policy performance.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS), a new method for using pretrained discrete diffusion models to recover images from noisy measurements without task-specific model retraining. APS improves existing discrete diffusion methods by adding quantized expectation and anchored remasking, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address limitations in existing discrete diffusion methods, which face challenges such as sparse derivative-free guidance, limited applicability due to continuous relaxations, and the dimensionality issues of split Gibbs samplers.

Method: The authors propose Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) with innovations including quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding in masked diffusion models.

Result: APS achieves state-of-the-art performance in discrete diffusion sampling across both linear and nonlinear inverse problems. It also shows advantages in training-free stylization and text-guided image editing.

Conclusion: Anchored Posterior Sampling provides a robust new approach for discrete diffusion posterior sampling by overcoming major prior limitations, ensuring faster inference, finer control, and broader applicability for generative tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian optimization framework using large language models (LLM) as surrogates to address high-dimensional black-box optimization problems, implementing adaptive approaches for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional black-box optimization challenges pose difficulties, especially with irregular variable types. Current Gaussian process methods, effective for low-dimensional tasks, struggle in these scenarios.

Method: The study utilizes LLMs as surrogate models, fine-tuned with a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and paired with a linear regression head fine-tuned through variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL). To optimize surrogate performance, an ensemble of LoRA-VBLL surrogates with recursive Bayesian updates is introduced.

Result: Experiments reveal that the (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL methods outperform existing alternatives in various high-dimensional benchmarks and real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently addresses high-dimensional black-box optimization problems, leveraging adaptive LLM-based surrogate models and recursive optimization techniques.

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Tyler Farghly,Peter Potaptchik,Samuel Howard,George Deligiannidis,Jakiw Pidstrigach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes diffusion models, linking their success to adapting to low-dimensional geometric data structures through score matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms enabling diffusion models to exhibit strong generalization capabilities in diverse domains.

Method: The authors examine score matching and explore smoothing effects on minimizers related to the data manifold.

Result: Smoothing the score function produces tangential smoothing to the data manifold, helping better adaptation.

Conclusion: By controlling smoothing, the model’s generalization is aligned with the data manifold, confirming the role of implicit regularization.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

### [276] [PEL-NAS: Search Space Partitioned Architecture Prompt Co-Evolutionary LLM-driven Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01472)
*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS is a novel approach to Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) utilizing search space partitioning and LLM-driven methods, achieving high accuracy, low latency, and significantly reduced search costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and exploration bias of traditional supernet-based and LLM-driven HW-NAS methods in finding diverse, accurate, and low-latency architectures.

Method: PEL-NAS uses three components: 1) search space partitioning by complexity to encourage architectural diversity, 2) LLM-driven co-evolution of architecture prompts and designs guided by a knowledge base, 3) zero-cost predictors to reduce training expense.

Result: PEL-NAS achieves higher accuracy, broader exploration, reduced latency (up to 54%), and shortened search costs—from days to minutes—on the HW-NAS-Bench compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: PEL-NAS effectively overcomes the limitations of existing HW-NAS approaches by introducing efficient, accurate, and diverse neural architecture generation techniques that perform well under real-world device constraints.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

*Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline RL datasets often contain contamination, which degrades policy performance. This paper proposes Weighted BC, a method using density ratios to down-weight corrupted data, achieving near-optimal performance despite high contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of contamination in offline RL datasets caused by system errors, adversaries, or low-quality samples, which negatively impact policy performance in current methods.

Method: Introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning, using a binary discriminator and a small clean reference set to compute density ratios. These ratios prioritize clean data in the imitation learning objective.

Result: Experiments show that Weighted BC retains near-optimal policy performance even with high contamination levels, outperforming existing methods like BC, BCQ, and BRAC.

Conclusion: Weighted BC provides a robust approach to offline RL in contaminated datasets, ensuring convergence to clean expert policies while integrating theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

### [278] [Understanding Adversarial Transfer: Why Representation-Space Attacks Fail Where Data-Space Attacks Succeed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01494)
*Isha Gupta,Rylan Schaeffer,Joshua Kazdan,Ken Liu,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines why adversarial attacks transfer differently between models, distinguishing between attacks in input data-space and those in model representation space. Researchers find that data-space attacks transfer more effectively, while representation-space attacks require geometric alignment between model representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why adversarial attacks transfer successfully in some scenarios (e.g., between classifiers or language models) but not in others (e.g., vision-language models).

Method: The authors differentiate attacks into data-space and representation-space domains. They analyze these attacks using mathematical proofs and empirically evaluate their behavior across four scenarios: image classifiers, language models (LMs), and vision-language models (VLMs).

Result: The study demonstrates that data-space attacks transfer effectively, while representation-space attacks fail to transfer unless the geometric alignments of the models’ latent spaces are sufficiently aligned. Results are backed by theoretical and empirical evidence over diverse settings.

Conclusion: Adversarial transferability depends on the attack domain - data-space vs. representation-space. Understanding these dynamics is key for designing robust models.

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

*Rui Ai,Yuqi Pan,David Simchi-Levi,Milind Tambe,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings in using majority voting to aggregate answers from multiple large language models (LLMs), proposing two advanced aggregation algorithms that improve reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multi-agent LLM reasoning progresses, there is a recognized need to efficiently aggregate diverse answers from multiple LLMs, overcoming the limitations of standard majority voting.

Method: The paper introduces two algorithms, Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), which leverage both first-order and second-order information to achieve better aggregation.

Result: The proposed methods were tested across synthetic datasets, popular LLM benchmarks, and a healthcare application, consistently outperforming traditional majority voting methods in reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimal Weight and ISP provide a practical and theoretical advancement over majority voting, enabling more robust decision-making in multi-agent LLM contexts and paving the way for improved aggregation approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

*Will Y. Zou,Jean Feng,Alexandre Kalimouttou,Jennifer Yuntong Zhang,Christopher W. Seymour,Romain Pirracchio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses skepticism around Reinforcement Learning (RL) usage in clinical decision-making by optimizing drug dosing policies using advanced methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners find RL methods for drug dosing in ICU patients unreliable, necessitating approaches that are trustworthy and clinically adoptable.

Method: The paper uses action space design with offline conservative Q-learning and novel recurrent modeling to improve drug dosing policies for ICU patients with septic shock.

Result: The proposed methods lead to improved patient outcomes, showing over a 15% survival improvement probability and compatibility with clinical protocols.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that properly designed RL frameworks can align with clinical practices, enhance interpretability, and improve patient survival.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

*Jinwoo Kim,Xingyue Huang,Krzysztof Olejniczak,Kyungbin Min,Michael Bronstein,Seunghoon Hong,İsmail İlkan Ceylan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flock introduces probabilistic node-relation equivariance to improve zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG foundation models struggle with distinguishing relations that are structurally similar but semantically distinct, limiting their expressiveness.

Method: Flock introduces probabilistic equivariance, utilizes random walks encoded into sequences, embeds them, and aggregates representations via learned pooling.

Result: Flock perfectly solves a diagnostic dataset called Petals and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 54 diverse KGs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances zero-shot link prediction capabilities and generalizes effectively across a wide range of KGs by breaking symmetries during inference.

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

*Hossein Sholehrasa,Xuan Xu,Doina Caragea,Jim E. Riviere,Majid Jaberi-Douraki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning framework for predicting fatal versus recovery outcomes in veterinary drug safety, using 1.28 million reports from OpenFDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate predictive tools to ensure the safety of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals, protecting human food safety and animal welfare.

Method: The authors used a preprocessing pipeline for data normalization and feature reduction, integrated drug properties, and applied machine learning models like CatBoost, Random Forest, and ensemble methods to classify outcomes. They also leveraged explainable AI with SHAP for interpretability.

Result: CatBoost and ensemble methods achieved high precision, recall, and F1-scores (0.95). Pseudo-labeling improved minority-class detection, and SHAP identified biologically relevant predictors such as organ disorders and drug properties.

Conclusion: The framework supports early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles in veterinary medicine, aiding regulatory and clinical decisions to boost food safety.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

*Diptyaroop Maji,Kang Yang,Prashant Shenoy,Ramesh K Sitaraman,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarbonX is an open-source tool using Time Series Foundation Models to forecast and impute carbon intensity globally, performing well even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key limitations in existing tools for carbon intensity forecasting, such as grid-specific dependencies and lack of uncertainty estimates.

Method: CarbonX leverages Time Series Foundation Models, relying solely on historical carbon intensity data to deliver predictions without requiring grid-specific electricity mix data.

Result: Achieved zero-shot Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide, state-of-the-art forecasting performance, and can make predictions for up to 21 days.

Conclusion: CarbonX is practical for global decarbonization tasks, offering reliable forecasts, uncertainty estimates, and adaptability across diverse grids.

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves the integer programming (IP) formulation for verifying the robustness of binarized neural networks (BNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving the verification problem for BNNs efficiently, especially overcoming the large integrality gap in the IP formulation.

Method: Introduce a linear objective for multi-class BNN verification and a new valid inequality generation technique that leverages BNNs' recursive structure.

Result: These techniques outperform existing IP approaches, enabling verification against larger input perturbations in limited time.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the practical verification of BNNs, offering a significant step forward in assessing their robustness more effectively.

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

*Haoyuan Cai,Zhenghao Peng,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in interactive imitation learning by introducing Predictive Preference Learning (PPL) to propagate human interventions into future states for improved decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve agent behavior in safety-critical regions and address the inefficiency of current interactive imitation learning methods, which only correct actions at the current state.

Method: PPL bootstraps human interventions into multiple future steps, using a preference horizon to optimize actions for future states, integrating implicit human preferences.

Result: The approach demonstrates increased efficiency and reduced human demonstrations needed in experiments on autonomous driving and robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: PPL enhances learning efficiency and generality in safety-critical environments and balances risky state coverage with label correctness to ensure the algorithm's effectiveness.

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo

### [286] [Round-trip Reinforcement Learning: Self-Consistent Training for Better Chemical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01527)
*Lecheng Kong,Xiyuan Wang,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL) to improve round-trip consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) for computational chemistry, resulting in better performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in computational chemistry show capability in bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction but struggle with round-trip consistency, indicating unidirectional learning limitations that affect task performance.

Method: RTRL uses round-trip transformation success as a reward signal for training, including an iterative variant that alternates forward and reverse mappings for self-improvement in a data-efficient manner.

Result: RTRL significantly enhances both performance and consistency across a variety of data regimes, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: Round-trip consistency can be trained as an objective, enabling more robust and reliable foundation models in computational chemistry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

*Jaiden Fairoze,Sanjam Garg,Keewoo Lee,Mingyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in current prompt guard mechanisms for LLMs, demonstrating attacks that bypass them and proposing a shift in focus from input blocking to output-based defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lightweight prompt guard mechanisms for AI safety are vulnerable to attacks, and this paper investigates their limitations to ensure better alignment and protection in LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces a novel attack exploiting resource asymmetry between prompt guards and main LLMs, effectively bypassing guards while maintaining response quality. This was tested across various established models.

Result: The proposed attack successfully jailbreaks multiple production LLMs, including those with highly secure chat interfaces, revealing critical architectural vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt guards are insufficient for AI safety; future defenses must emphasize preventing malicious outputs rather than merely blocking malicious inputs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

*Haokun Zhao,Xiang Zhang,Jiaqi Wei,Yiwei Xu,Yuting He,Siqi Sun,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TSci, an LLM-driven framework for general time series forecasting that automates preprocessing, validation, and ensembling, outperforming conventional methods with reduced forecast error and enhanced transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting involves significant challenges due to the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required for reliable predictions. Current models often lack generalization and tailored solutions for diverse domains.

Method: TSci utilizes four agents: a Curator for preprocessing via LLM-guided diagnostics, Planner for model selection using multi-modal diagnostics, Forecaster for adaptive model fitting and ensembling, and Reporter to synthesize the workflow into interpretable reports.

Result: The TSci framework outperforms statistical and LLM-based baselines across eight benchmarks, achieving average forecast error reductions of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively, while offering transparent workflow documentation.

Conclusion: TSci establishes itself as a domain-agnostic and interpretable solution for general time series forecasting, making decision-making workflows more efficient, reliable, and comprehensible.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

### [290] [Executable Counterfactuals: Improving LLMs' Causal Reasoning Through Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539)
*Aniket Vashishtha,Qirun Dai,Hongyuan Mei,Amit Sharma,Chenhao Tan,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, executable counterfactuals, to comprehensively assess and enhance LLMs' counterfactual reasoning, encompassing abduction, intervention, and prediction steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLMs' counterfactual reasoning is pivotal for ensuring their causal understanding and applicability in high-stakes domains. Existing methods skip critical abduction steps, leading to inflated performance assessments.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on executable counterfactuals using code and math problems that require abduction, intervention, and prediction. It includes scalable synthetic data creation with variable difficulties.

Result: SOTA models show significant accuracy drops (25-40%) when transitioning from interventional to counterfactual reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning enhances generalization across domains, outperforming supervised finetuning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows greater promise than supervised finetuning for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks and structures.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

### [291] [MIRA: Towards Mitigating Reward Hacking in Inference-Time Alignment of T2I Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)
*Kevin Zhai,Utsav Singh,Anirudh Thatipelli,Souradip Chakraborty,Anit Kumar Sahu,Furong Huang,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRA, a method to prevent reward hacking in diffusion image generation by incorporating image-space constraints during inference, achieving improvements in alignment without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate images from text prompts but often fail to satisfy user-specific rewards like Aesthetic Scores. Fine-tuning is costly, so the paper aims to find an efficient inference-time alternative that prevents reward hacking.

Method: MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking) is an inference-time method that uses an image-space score-based KL surrogate and a frozen backbone to regularize sampling trajectories, ensuring reward gains without deviating from the original text prompt.

Result: MIRA exhibits a >60% win rate over strong baselines across various models, rewards, and datasets, showing reward increments with minimal drift compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively mitigates reward hacking during inference while maintaining prompt adherence and extending its applicability to non-differentiable rewards.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

*Kezhao Liu,Jason Klein Liu,Mingtao Chen,Yiming Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies two perspectives on KL regularization in RLHF, proving their theoretical equivalence and criticizing biased approximations like GRPO's method. It also proposes corrections for off-policy implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and biases in the implementation of KL divergence loss in RLHF and unify different methodological perspectives for more robust applications.

Method: The paper establishes a theoretical framework connecting detached coefficient ($k_n$ in reward) and integrated gradient-based ($k_n$ as loss) implementations of KL regularization, analyzing their equivalence and inherent biases.

Result: It demonstrates that '$k_1$ in reward' is the principled KL loss and '$k_2$ as loss' is gradient-equivalent under on-policy conditions, while '$k_3$ as loss' is a biased first-order approximation and off-policy methods require corrected importance sampling.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified and comprehensive theoretical grounding for KL implementations in RLHF and suggests corrections to improve robustness and decrease bias in training algorithms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

### [293] [Large-Scale Bayesian Causal Discovery with Interventional Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01562)
*Seong Woo Han,Daniel Duy Vo,Brielin C. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBCD, a Bayesian framework for causal discovery using interventional data, which improves uncertainty quantification and structure recovery in large-scale tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods face challenges in performance and uncertainty quantification, especially in large-scale scenarios.

Method: IBCD uses an empirical Bayesian framework, applying a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior and modeling causal effects with a matrix normal distribution. Observational data informs edge weights under scale-free or Erdős–Rényi structures.

Result: Simulations prove IBCD's enhanced structure recovery, outperforming baselines. Application to CRISPR Perturb-seq data on 521 genes validates robust graph structure identification using edge posterior inclusion probabilities.

Conclusion: IBCD is a promising solution for causal discovery, addressing large-scale performance issues and enabling uncertainty-informed inference.

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with protein language models (PLMs) for protein design tasks, showing RL enhances sampling efficiency and uncovers capabilities beyond supervised learning, while task-specific constraints dictate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if reinforcement learning can enhance protein language models by uncovering latent sequence-structure-function rules in protein design, going beyond supervised learning limitations.

Method: They combined RL with PLMs across four protein design tasks (antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody engineering, and inverse folding) and tested various RL algorithms and model types. They analyzed task-specific aspects (rewards, capacity, etc.) that affect RL performance.

Result: RL consistently improved sampling efficiency and success rates. Performance depended on task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity. When rewards were accurate and tasks had room for improvement, RL performance scaled effectively; otherwise, it plateaued.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for applying RL in protein design, emphasizing reward modeling and calibration, aligning algorithms and task difficulty, and focusing on tasks with high potential for gain. Source code is publicly available for further exploration of this approach.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

### [295] [Gradient Shaping Beyond Clipping: A Functional Perspective on Update Magnitude Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01578)
*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAMP is proposed as a unified framework to enhance gradient clipping, making it more adaptive and flexible for optimizing deep network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rigid and fixed thresholds used in traditional gradient clipping methods lack flexibility and fail to incorporate gradient distribution dynamics, necessitating a more dynamic and adaptive approach.

Method: SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics, dynamically determines thresholds, and employs power-based differentiable transformations to modulate gradient updates. It generalizes clipping into a per-layer adaptive scheme while unifying clipping and warmup mechanisms.

Result: SPAMP demonstrates improved stability, convergence, and robustness in deep network training across diverse tasks, including image and language domains.

Conclusion: SPAMP offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional gradient clipping, enhancing deep learning optimization by addressing its weaknesses.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

*Joykirat Singh,Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Akshay Nambi,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRAAC is a post-training RL method that improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency by adaptively balancing underthinking and overthinking based on task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning models struggle with modulating their reasoning effort, leading to errors on hard tasks or inefficiencies on simpler ones. This under-adaptivity limits their performance and efficiency.

Method: TRAAC uses post-training reinforcement learning to leverage a model's self-attention mechanism. It identifies important reasoning steps, prunes redundant ones, and calibrates reasoning effort based on task difficulty.

Result: TRAAC improves reasoning accuracy by an average of 8.4% with a 36.8% reduction in reasoning length against base models. It also generalizes well to non-math datasets, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TRAAC successfully addresses under-adaptivity by balancing reasoning effort proportionally to task difficulty and enhances models' generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

*Ziming Tang,Chengbin Hou,Tianyu Zhang,Bangxu Tian,Jinbao Wang,Hairong Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes NoRo, a framework for robustly predicting UPDRS scores of Parkinson’s patients despite noise in telemonitoring, using noise-robust features and a novel evaluation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by PD telemonitoring systems due to noise factors such as patient-induced inaccuracies, environmental noise, and data loss, which lead to errors in UPDRS prediction.

Method: NoRo groups speech features into ordered bins to create contrastive pairs, employs a multilayer perceptron to encode noise-robust features, integrates them with original features, and uses these for UPDRS predictions. Additionally, it introduces a customizable noise injection evaluation module.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that NoRo succeeds in enhancing noise robustness under diverse conditions, consistently improving UPDRS score predictions across multiple models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates noise impacts in telemonitoring, advancing UPDRS prediction reliability and adaptability in various noisy settings.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a solution using spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) to generate high-quality true random bits for enhancing security in generative AI systems, avoiding the vulnerabilities of conventional pseudo-random number generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic pseudo-random number generators in generative AI models result in predictable patterns that attackers can exploit, necessitating a more secure alternative.

Method: The authors embed hardware-generated true random bits from STT-MTJs into a generative AI system and test its performance using a prototype FPGA-based computing system. The approach reduces insecure outputs by integrating these hardware RNGs into a generative adversarial network.

Result: The system successfully delivers megabit-per-second true random numbers, passes NIST randomness tests, and significantly reduces insecure outputs in GANs trained on CIFAR-10 (by up to 18.6 times). It achieves high scalability and energy efficiency with nanosecond switching speed.

Conclusion: Spintronic RNGs, embedded with STT-MTJs, offer a scalable, effective, and energy-efficient solution as secure components for next-generation generative AI systems, with potential applications in large language models.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Posterior collapse in VAEs is identified as a phase transition influenced by data structure and hyper-parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand posterior collapse in VAEs through the lens of statistical physics and uncover its causes.

Method: Analyzing the stability of the trivial solution and identifying a critical hyper-parameter threshold via theoretical derivations and empirical validation.

Result: A critical boundary characterized by KL divergence discontinuity was observed, validating phase transition behavior through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Posterior collapse is caused by an intrinsic phase transition rather than merely optimization failure, linking it to data structure and variational constraints in VAEs.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the relationship between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in reasoning tasks for Large Language Models, finding that high SFT scores do not necessarily improve RL outcomes and proposing alternative predictive metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether high SFT scores reliably translate to better post-RL performance for reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments on hundreds of models (up to 12B parameters), using SFT and RLVR (via GRPO), across 7 math benchmarks with detailed performance evaluations, leveraging alternate metrics like generalization loss.

Result: High SFT scores were often biased and not predictive of RL performance; alternative metrics like generalization loss and Pass@large k showed stronger predictive power, improving correlation metrics significantly.

Conclusion: High SFT scores are not a reliable indicator of post-RL performance, and alternative metrics provide better predictive capability. Different SFT strategies yield varied outcomes after RL training and an associated evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Motivation: To address the limitations in the availability of high-quality training data for LLMs and explore if synthetic data can mitigate these constraints while maintaining model performance.

Result: Pre-training entirely on rephrased synthetic data is not faster than natural web text. Mixing one-third rephrased synthetic data with two-thirds natural data can accelerate training by 5-10x. However, training on textbook-style synthetic data alone leads to higher loss in downstream tasks. Optimal synthetic data ratios (30% for rephrased data) depend on model size and data budget. Larger generator models (~8B parameters) do not consistently produce better synthetic pre-training data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data has conditional benefits for LLM training, with mixed outcomes depending on its type and usage ratios. It holds potential but requires strategic application to prevent issues like model collapse.

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [302] [CAT: Curvature-Adaptive Transformers for Geometry-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01634)
*Ryan Y. Lin,Siddhartha Ojha,Nicholas Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), which dynamically routes tokens to geometric attention mechanisms optimized for different manifolds, outperforming fixed-geometry baselines in relational reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers assume Euclidean geometry, limiting their effectiveness for data with non-Euclidean structures. Fixed-geometry approaches (e.g., hyperbolic or spherical) require a prior commitment to one geometry, reducing flexibility for data with mixed geometric properties.

Method: The paper proposes CAT, an architecture with three geometric attention branches (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical) and a lightweight gating mechanism that dynamically routes tokens based on local relational structures. Each branch uses geometry-specific operations optimized for its manifold.

Result: CAT achieves approximately a 10% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@10 metrics on knowledge graph completion benchmarks compared to fixed-geometry baselines, with only a 5% increase in parameters and comparable inference time.

Conclusion: The introduction of CAT demonstrates that dynamically adapting to varying geometric structures is superior to using a fixed geometry, providing a scalable and interpretable solution for diverse relational reasoning tasks across domains like language, vision, and multimodal applications.

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

*Liyan Xie,Muhammad Siddeek,Mohamed Seif,Andrea J. Goldsmith,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect and localize edits to watermarked outputs of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting the integrity of AI-generated text requires identifying edits to watermarked outputs, especially amidst human revisions and spoofing.

Method: A combinatorial pattern-based watermarking approach is used, employing vocabulary partitioning and deterministic patterns for generation, along with global and local statistics to detect and localize edits.

Result: The method shows high accuracy in detecting and localizing edits in watermarked LLM outputs across various editing scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for ensuring the traceability and integrity of watermarked LLM outputs, even after post-generation modifications.

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

*Maryam Aliakbarpour,Vladimir Braverman,Junze Yin,Haochen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the quadratic complexity in softmax attention of large language models by introducing a new framework for efficient approximation, overcoming the limitations of bounded-entry assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the quadratic complexity bottleneck in softmax attention for scaling large language models (LLMs) and the limitations posed by existing bounded-entry assumptions in approximation algorithms.

Method: The proposed method, support-basis decomposition, leverages sub-Gaussian behavior of matrix entries to split components, enabling exact computation for sparse entries along with polynomial approximation for dense ones, while offering theoretical guarantees for sub-quadratic runtime.

Result: Empirical and theoretical demonstrations show the framework achieves sub-quadratic runtime, extends applicability beyond bounded assumptions, and validates the approximation efficacy of multiple polynomial attentions with sketching.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable solution for efficient attention computation in LLMs and extends theoretical understanding of polynomial attention, ensuring its practical relevance and broader applicability.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

### [305] [Source-Free Cross-Domain Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01649)
*Muhammad Tanzil Furqon,Mahardhika Pratama,Igor Škrjanc,Lin Liu,Habibullah Habibullah,Kutluyil Dogancay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called REFEREE for source-free cross-domain continual learning, addressing challenges of privacy constraints, domain shifts, noisy pseudo labels, and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in cross-domain continual learning require a fully labeled source domain, limiting usability in privacy-sensitive contexts. There is a need for solutions that eliminate dependence on source-domain samples.

Method: REFEREE synergizes a source-pre-trained model and a vision-language model. It employs frequency-aware prompting to generate robust samples, uncertainty-aware weighting to handle noisy pseudo labels, and Kernel LDA to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Result: REFEREE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that rely on source domain samples, showing significant numerical improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed REFEREE approach successfully provides a source-free solution for cross-domain continual learning, addressing privacy and generalization issues while demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

*Kwanhee Lee,Hyeondo Jang,Dongyeop Lee,Dan Alistarh,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Elsa, a method that achieves high sparsity (up to 90%) in pruning neural networks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods are limited in achieving high sparsity without loss of accuracy.

Method: Uses constrained optimization techniques, specifically ADMM, to tackle limitations in conventional surrogate objective approaches.

Result: Elsa shows significant improvements, achieving 7.8× less perplexity than previous methods at 90% sparsity.

Conclusion: Elsa and its scalable variant Elsa_L demonstrate progress in neural network pruning, indicating further unexploited opportunities in LLM sparsity advancement.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

### [307] [Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization: mini-critics boost LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01656)
*Jiashun Liu,Johan Obando-Ceron,Han Lu,Yancheng He,Weixun Wang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng,Pablo Samuel Castro,Aaron Courville,Ling Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a scalable framework for RL4LLMs that restores the role of critics efficiently in large-model contexts, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL4LLMs typically avoid explicit critics due to computational inefficiencies and challenges in sparse rewards, prompting a need for an alternative approach.

Method: AsyPPO employs lightweight mini-critics trained on disjoint prompt shards, enabling diversity and reducing value-estimation bias. It uses inter-critic uncertainty to refine policy updates by masking and filtering unnecessary exploration.

Result: AsyPPO outperforms strong baselines like GRPO, showcasing over six percent performance improvement on Qwen3-4b-Base and three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base using open-source data with limited samples.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the role of architectural innovation for creating scalable and efficient RL algorithms, demonstrating superiority with AsyPPO in large-scale settings.

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

### [308] [Learning Time-Series Representations by Hierarchical Uniformity-Tolerance Latent Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01658)
*Amin Jalali,Milad Soltany,Michael Greenspan,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeHUT is a novel method for learning time-series representations, balancing uniformity and tolerance through hierarchical and temperature scheduler mechanisms. It outperforms prior methods in classification and is competitive in anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of effectively capturing both instance-wise and temporal dependencies in time-series data, while balancing uniformity and tolerance within the embedding space for contrastive learning.

Method: TimeHUT employs a hierarchical approach with a temperature scheduler to balance uniformity and tolerance. It introduces hierarchical angular margin loss to preserve positive pair coherence and negative pair separation. The method is tested on univariate and multivariate classification as well as anomaly detection datasets.

Result: TimeHUT demonstrates superior performance on 128 UCR and 30 UAE time-series classification datasets, with competitive results on the Yahoo and KPI anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: TimeHUT effectively enhances time-series representation learning by incorporating hierarchical structures and balancing loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and promising results in anomaly detection, with extensive evaluations validating its components.

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) enable symbolic representation recovery via spline-based activation functions but face pruning challenges. The proposed method, ShapKAN, uses Shapley value attribution for shift-invariant node importance assessment, achieving effective network compression with consistent rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks struggle with interpretability while KANs aim to link feature-input relationships symbolically. Efficient pruning of KANs is necessary for resource-constrained deployment without losing interpretability.

Method: ShapKAN leverages Shapley value attribution to measure node importance in a shift-invariant manner, enabling network compression without relying solely on magnitude-based techniques.

Result: ShapKAN was demonstrated to preserve true node importance and enhance network compression across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ShapKAN improves KAN’s interpretability and efficiency, making the architecture more feasible for deployment in limited-resource environments.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [310] [Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677)
*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive Gated Fusion Network (AGFN) to address limitations in multimodal sentiment analysis, enhancing performance by mitigating noisy inputs and prioritizing relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sentiment analysis struggles with variability in modality quality, such as noise or missing information, leading to poor prediction of subtle emotional nuances.

Method: The proposed AGFN uses a dual gate fusion mechanism that adjusts feature weights based on information entropy and modality importance, reducing noisy modalities' influence and emphasizing critical cues.

Result: Experimental results on datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show significant improvement in accuracy compared to strong baselines, effectively identifying subtle emotional expressions.

Conclusion: The AGFN framework improves generalization and robustness in multimodal sentiment analysis by reducing prediction error dependency on specific feature locations and learning from a broader feature spectrum.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

### [311] [PASTA: A Unified Framework for Offline Assortment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01693)
*Juncheng Dong,Weibin Mo,Zhengling Qi,Cong Shi,Ethan X. Fang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven framework, PASTA, aimed at solving assortment optimization problems by addressing insufficient data coverage with a pessimism-based approach, achieving minimax optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms often lack prior knowledge of customer choice models, making it challenging to identify optimal assortments due to insufficient data coverage.

Method: The PASTA (Pessimistic Assortment Optimization) framework uses offline customer choice data and leverages pessimism, ensuring optimal assortments without requiring full data coverage of all possible combinations.

Result: PASTA achieves the first finite-sample regret bounds, with demonstrated minimax optimality across choice models like multinomial and nested logit. It consistently outperforms existing baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: By leveraging pessimism, PASTA resolves key limitations in assortment optimization, providing a provably effective solution with robust theoretical guarantees and practical results.

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT) enhances representation similarity methods by introducing globally consistent layer-to-layer and neuron-level mappings, handling network depth mismatches and achieving higher alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard representation similarity methods struggle with asymmetry, lack of global metrics, and limitations in handling networks of differing depths.

Method: HOT employs a global optimization framework to jointly derive soft, consistent mappings between layers and neurons while handling mismatches through distributed mass transport.

Result: Evaluation on vision models, language models, and human visual cortex recordings shows HOT surpasses traditional methods, offering smooth hierarchical layer correspondences.

Conclusion: HOT represents a robust improvement in comparing network representations, enabling richer interpretability and handling mismatched architectures.

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised model named ActiNet, combined with a hidden Markov model (HMM), outperforms a Random Forest (RF) + HMM model in classifying physical activity intensity from wrist-accelerometer data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of human activity recognition models in large-scale epidemiological studies using wrist-accelerometer data.

Method: The authors developed the ActiNet model, a self-supervised, 18-layer ResNet-V2 variant, combined with HMM smoothing, and compared its performance to an RF + HMM baseline using data from 151 CAPTURE-24 participants.

Result: The ActiNet model achieved a mean macro F1 score of 0.82 and a mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86, outperforming the RF + HMM baseline (0.77 F1 score, 0.81 Cohen's kappa).

Conclusion: ActiNet shows promise as a reliable tool for extracting physical activity intensity labels in epidemiological research, with consistent results across demographic subgroups.

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of unimodal systems and optimize latency in a multi-UAV network while enabling efficient federated multimodal learning.

Method: The paper uses an iterative optimization algorithm employing block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques to optimize UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, and other system parameters.

Result: Numerical experiments show that the proposed FML framework reduces system latency and enhances model training performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The UAV-assisted FML framework is effective in reducing latency and improving learning outcomes, supported by theoretical convergence analysis under non-convex loss functions.

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

Motivation: Attention mechanisms are computationally intensive, and existing optimizations lack mathematically guaranteed acceleration. The paper introduces a new methodology to improve attention efficiency without losing precision.

Method: The authors use Basis Decomposition to restructure multi-head projections and implement BD Attention (BDA), ensuring lossless output while optimizing performance. The approach involves offline preparation without retraining.

Result: On DeepSeek-V2-Lite, BDA achieved 32% faster key/value projections, 25% weight reduction, and negligible perplexity increase, showcasing its computational advantages on modern GPUs.

Conclusion: BDA introduces a theoretically exact attention acceleration method that complements existing optimizations, providing architecture-agnostic improvements in computational efficiency without compromising model accuracy.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

### [316] [Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721)
*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) with linear function approximation, aiming at robust performance under model uncertainties without restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disparity between empirical success and theoretical guarantees in robust reinforcement learning algorithms, especially in scenarios involving model uncertainties.

Method: The proposed algorithm uses a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update combined with an outer-loop target-network update, focusing on robustness via total-variation and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty sets.

Result: The research establishes a sample complexity of $	ilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ to achieve an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate, bridging the gap between empirical results and theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the theoretical foundation of robust reinforcement learning, ensuring reliability under uncertainties, and extend to robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

*Tanay Rastogi,Anders Karlström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep neural networks (DNNs) as a method for workplace location choice modeling and compares their performance to traditional discrete choice models (DCMs), showcasing superior results in some scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research arises from the challenges traditional DCMs face in accurately representing personal decision-making processes for workplace location choices.

Method: The study utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) to analyze workplace location choices, comparing their effectiveness against traditional DCMs in various contexts.

Result: DNNs show potential as a robust alternative to DCMs, outperforming them in specific scenarios while DCMs remain more suitable for analyzing individual attributes' effects on workplace distance, especially for shorter distances.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of choosing the appropriate modeling technique based on the specific requirements of workplace location choice analysis, as DNNs and DCMs each have their strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

### [318] [Private and Fair Machine Learning: Revisiting the Disparate Impact of Differentially Private SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01744)
*Lea Demelius,Dominik Kowald,Simone Kopeinik,Roman Kern,Andreas Trügler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how hyperparameter tuning impacts fairness and performance in models trained with DPSGD, emphasizing disparities in performance metrics and trade-offs between privacy, utility, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by concerns regarding the negative impact of differential privacy mechanisms like DPSGD on fairness in neural networks, especially when hyperparameters from non-private models are reused.

Method: The authors compare DPSGD's effects across various performance metrics and hyperparameters, and extend their analysis to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, assessing how these settings influence fairness and utility.

Result: The study finds that while tuning hyperparameters directly on private models can improve utility-fairness trade-offs, the disparate impact on metrics persists, and privacy leakage due to hyperparameter adjustments remains a concern.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning offers improvement in utility-fairness balance but does not systematically resolve fairness issues under DPSGD. Approaches like DPSGD-Global-Adapt may not be robust across hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address challenges in directly comparing learned regularization frameworks for imaging inverse problems due to diverse architectures and implementations.

Method: The authors collected and unified multiple frameworks into a common platform, enabling modular comparison and systematic evaluation, alongside concise method descriptions and practical guidelines.

Result: The unified framework revealed strengths and limitations of the various methods, offering valuable insights and systematic evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides a standardized evaluation platform for learned regularization frameworks in imaging, aiding future research and development in the field.

Abstract: In recent years, a variety of learned regularization frameworks for solving
inverse problems in imaging have emerged. These offer flexible modeling
together with mathematical insights. The proposed methods differ in their

challenging due to non-modular implementations. We address this gap by

unified view allows us to systematically compare the approaches and highlight
their strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into their future
potential. We also provide concise descriptions of each method, complemented by
practical guidelines.

*Bruno Corcuera,Carlos Eiras-Franco,Brais Cancela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent representations are improved by unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) to filter irrelevant image features, enhancing model performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of noisy or irrelevant features in vision tasks that degrade machine learning model performance and generalization.

Method: Unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) identifies and removes misleading/redundant image features to enhance latent space representations.

Result: The approach improves generalization performance in tasks such as clustering and image generation with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: DFS effectively strengthens latent representations without relying on labeled data, benefiting diverse datasets and domains for vision tasks.

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

TL;DR: Octax introduces a GPU-accelerated suite of classic arcade game environments for reinforcement learning (RL) research, based on CHIP-8 emulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL environments, such as those based on modern games or Atari benchmarks, are computationally expensive and poorly suited for scalable experimentation.

Method: Octax is implemented in JAX to emulate CHIP-8-based games with high fidelity while leveraging GPUs for increased speed and scalability.

Result: Octax achieves massive speedup compared to traditional CPU emulators and enables researchers to train RL agents more effectively across multiple games.

Conclusion: Octax offers a scalable, modular platform for large-scale RL experimentation, fostering innovation and ease of extension with new games or novel environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

*Clémentine Courtès,Emmanuel Franck,Michael Kraus,Laurent Navoret,Léopold Trémant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics while solving instability and gauge dependency issues, proposing two new training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to predict long-term dynamics while preserving structural integrity in both models and numerical methods, overcoming challenges in stability and gauge dependency.

Method: Two training strategies are introduced: direct learning of the vector field and learning time-discrete dynamics through numerical schemes.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated the ability to handle complex physical dynamics, such as guiding centers in gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Conclusion: By addressing numerical instability and gauge dependency issues, the study offers effective training methods for non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics modeling.

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of post-hoc privacy filtering for synthetic medical datasets and finds significant limitations in their ability to safeguard patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address concerns regarding the effectiveness of post-hoc privacy filtering methods in removing personally identifiable information, particularly in medical AI applications.

Method: A rigorous evaluation process was conducted using a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. The filters were tested for specificity, consistency, and sensitivity.

Result: Filters showed limited specificity and consistency, reliably detecting only real images but failing to identify near-duplicates derived from training data.

Conclusion: Post-hoc filtering methods currently fail to ensure reliable privacy preservation, posing risks of exposing patient information and necessitating major improvements in filter design for sensitive medical applications.

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

*Meng-Hsi Chen,Yu-Ang Lee,Feng-Ting Liao,Da-shan Shiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hourglass MLPs that invert the conventional narrow-wide-narrow structure of MLPs by using wide-narrow-wide blocks and fixed projections. This achieves superior generative task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reevaluating the conventional design of skip connections and hidden layers in MLPs to enhance efficiency and generative task performance.

Method: Proposed a novel Hourglass MLP design with wide-narrow-wide blocks, leveraging fixed random projections and systematic architectural search on generative tasks.

Result: Hourglass MLPs consistently achieved better performance-parameter Pareto frontiers compared to conventional MLPs, with scaling trends favoring deeper networks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest adopting wide-narrow-wide structures for efficiency and performance, with implications for other networks like Transformers.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes Sparse Query Attention (SQA), which focuses on reducing computational complexity in Transformer models by decreasing the number of Query heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to tackle the quadratic computational bottleneck of Multi-Head Attention mechanisms in Transformer models, particularly for long sequences.

Method: The paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA) to reduce attention computational complexity by decreasing Query heads, backed by theoretical foundations and benchmark testing.

Result: SQA showed up to 3x throughput improvement in long-sequence tasks with negligible quality impact.

Conclusion: SQA provides a promising direction for creating more efficient and scalable Transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: The paper proposes an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization, leveraging an autoregressive generative model and adapting GRPO for stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional EDAs that are costly and fail to capture complex dependencies efficiently in combinatorial optimization.

Method: The authors use a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained with random variable orders, combined with GRPO for stable policy-gradient updates.

Result: The framework performs well across a variety of benchmarks, consistently avoiding failures and often achieving the best outcomes.

Conclusion: Order-invariance and improved sample efficiency can significantly enhance reinforcement learning performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reducing AutoML search space using pre-hoc model selection with traditional models and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoML exhausts resources by relying on exhaustive hyperparameter searches for model selection, necessitating more computationally efficient alternatives.

Method: The study leverages dataset descriptions, statistical information, traditional models, and LLMs to intelligently pre-select models and apply them to the AWS AutoGluon benchmark dataset.

Result: This approach successfully reduced computational overhead in the AutoML process while maintaining the ability to select the best-performing model.

Conclusion: Utilizing pre-hoc prediction techniques in AutoML can streamline workflows, minimizing resource usage without compromising performance.

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in representation learning within formal verification, particularly as compared to its success in vision and language domains.

Method: Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML) uses a self-supervised contrastive objective to jointly embed logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space.

Result: CNML significantly outperforms existing algorithmic and neural baselines on industry-inspired retrieval tasks and exhibits strong generalization capabilities to complex formulas.

Conclusion: Model checking tasks can act as effective learning signals for representation learning in formal languages, as demonstrated by CNML's performance and transferability.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

*Lexiang Hu,Yikang Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents LieNLSD, a method to discover nonlinear symmetries and their generators in dynamical systems, improving neural PDE solvers and symmetry-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying nonlinear symmetries in complex systems, as most prior methods were limited to linear symmetries or lacked precise Lie algebra subspace computation.

Method: LieNLSD uses a defined function library for infinitesimal group actions and a linear system derived from central differences, Jacobian matrices, and the infinitesimal criterion, solved via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Result: LieNLSD outperforms existing methods in various benchmarks, including dynamical systems and top quark tagging, achieving over 20% improvement in long rollout accuracy for neural PDE solvers.

Conclusion: LieNLSD is the first effective method for discovering nonlinear symmetry generators, offering significant advantages in data augmentation, analysis, and performance enhancement in neural networks involving physics-based systems.

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for online learning in environments where cost and constraint functions are adversarial and lack common feasible points.

Method: Develops algorithms by reducing the constrained learning problem to standard OCO with surrogate cost functions.

Result: Proposed algorithms achieve universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds, surpassing prior work.

Conclusion: Constrained online learning is effectively addressed in adversarial settings using the proposed algorithms, enhancing theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization
(OCO) framework with online adversarial constraints. We present two algorithms
having simple modular structures that yield universal dynamic regret and
cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the state-of-the-art
results. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and
constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint
functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are
established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of extreme memory demands in training large language models by analyzing gradient space and introducing algorithms to optimize memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extreme memory requirements of training large language models, particularly due to optimizer states, necessitate innovative strategies to reduce the computational burden.

Method: The authors analyze gradient dynamics and geometry, introducing randomized algorithms named GrassWalk and GrassJump to optimize subspace usage and improve memory efficiency.

Result: GrassWalk and GrassJump achieve state-of-the-art memory savings and enhance performance on LLaMA-1B and LLaMA-7B model pretraining.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are effective in addressing memory bottlenecks and demonstrate the importance of considering gradient space geometry in LLM training.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

### [332] [Multi-marginal temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching for video generation from unpaired data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01894)
*Thomas Gravier,Thomas Boyer,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Marginal Temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (MMtSBM) for reconstructing dynamic processes from static data, particularly addressing scalability and high-dimensional challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural dynamic processes often can only be observed through static snapshots, but understanding their temporal dynamics is crucial for scientific research. Existing methods for this reconstruction face scalability issues and rely on restrictive assumptions.

Method: The authors propose MMtSBM, which extends the Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching framework through a novel Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to handle multiple marginals efficiently and factorized formats.

Result: MMtSBM proves effective on toy datasets, achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional tasks like transcriptomic trajectory inference, and for the first time, reconstructs dynamics in very high-dimensional image datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates MMtSBM's utility as a scalable and principled solution for recovering hidden dynamics from static observations, making it practical for diverse applications.

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

*Md Talha Mohsin,Ismail Abdulrashid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research introduces a multimodal foundation model using a transformer framework to integrate diverse healthcare data for better early disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic models analyze healthcare data sources in isolation, limiting cross-modal correlations essential for early diagnosis.

Method: A transformer-based architecture consolidates data using modality-specific encoders, shared latent spaces, multi-head attention layers, and pretraining for adaptability.

Result: Using experimental benchmarks in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, the model demonstrates effectiveness in early disease detection tasks.

Conclusion: This study aims to enable a unified foundation model for precision diagnostics, enhancing prediction accuracy and aiding clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

*Mayur Kishor Shende,Ole-Christoffer Granmo,Runar Helin,Vladimir I. Zadorozhny,Rishad Shafik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Tsetlin Machine (TM), a logic-based, interpretable machine learning model, for large-scale RGB image classification, achieving competitive performance against deep learning models on MNIST and CelebA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop interpretable machine learning approaches capable of handling large-scale, multi-channel image classification tasks while performing competitively with deep learning models.

Method: The paper introduces a methodology for generating local interpretations and global class representations using Tsetlin Machine clauses, visualized as images, and evaluates the performance on MNIST and CelebA datasets.

Result: TM achieves 98.5% accuracy on MNIST and an F1-score of 86.56% on CelebA, demonstrating comparable performance to ResNet50 (88.07% F1-score) while offering interpretability.

Conclusion: TM is an effective, interpretable alternative for RGB image classification, capable of handling complex datasets without sacrificing competitive performance.

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

*Zhaoyan Wang,Zheng Gao,Arogya Kharel,In-Young Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents RoGRAD, an iterative framework for robust graph learning using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, enhancing Graph Neural Networks' (GNNs) performance under multiple deficiencies while surpassing both traditional GNN and Large Language Model (LLM) augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation of GNNs caused by compound deficiencies in real-world graph data and to evaluate whether conventional or LLM-augmented approaches handle these issues better.

Method: The study introduces RoGRAD, a novel iterative framework that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide class-consistent and diverse augmentations, optimizing graph representations through iterative contrastive learning.

Result: RoGRAD demonstrated up to an 82.43% average improvement in performance over traditional GNNs and recent LLM-enhanced methods under diverse graph deficiencies.

Conclusion: RoGRAD offers a dynamic and robust method to enhance graph learning by addressing graph deficiencies more effectively than existing static and one-shot LLM augmentation approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

*Yujie Zhou,Pengyang Ling,Jiazi Bu,Yibin Wang,Yuhang Zang,Jiaqi Wang,Li Niu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Granular-GRPO ($G^2$RPO) framework to improve reinforcement learning in flow models by enhancing reward assessments through singular stochastic sampling and multi-granularity evaluations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods integrating reinforcement learning into diffusion and flow models face challenges in aligning preferences due to sparse and narrow reward signals despite effective exploration of high-value samples.

Method: The proposed $G^2$RPO framework incorporates Singular Stochastic Sampling for step-wise exploration with better reward-noise correlation and Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration to eliminate the bias from fixed-granularity evaluations.

Result: Experimental results across various reward models show that $G^2$RPO outperforms current baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The $G^2$RPO framework enhances preference alignment in generative models through precise and comprehensive reward assessment methods, marking a step forward in reinforcement learning for flow models.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

*Zhizhong Li,Sina Sajadmanesh,Jingtao Li,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometry-aware extension of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), leveraging a three-factor decomposition to improve fine-tuning performance on large-scale pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA, though efficient, underperforms compared to full fine-tuning due to inadequate exploitation of low-rank geometric structures.

Method: A geometry-aware method using a three-factor decomposition ($U\!SV^\top$) that relies on orthonormal constraints on subspaces $U$ and $V$ via Stiefel manifold optimization, compatible with existing pipelines.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across diverse tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, image classification, and generation, outperforming state-of-the-art LoRA variants.

Conclusion: The geometry-aware extension of LoRA effectively enhances fine-tuning efficiency and performance by leveraging geometric optimization techniques, offering a practical solution compatible with current systems.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Moon, a framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, addressing challenges in existing methods by integrating numeric and image data with improved interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS anomaly detection methods face challenges such as reliance on error thresholds, underuse of anomaly labels, high computational costs, and scarcity of labeled data.

Method: Moon introduces a supervised framework using Multivariate Markov Transition Fields to convert numeric data into image-like representations and utilizes a Multimodal-CNN for feature fusion. A SHAP-based explainer enhances interpretability.

Result: Moon outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy, and 10.8% in interpretation performance on six real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Moon improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of MTS anomaly detection, addressing limitations in existing methods while providing detailed anomaly analyses.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

*Samuel Maddock,Graham Cormode,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study integrates post-hoc model calibration techniques into Federated Learning (FL), adapting them for client heterogeneity and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable decision-making in FL applications, such as healthcare and finance, requires calibrated models. However, federated private calibration has been overlooked.

Method: The authors transfer centralized calibration methods, like histogram binning and temperature scaling, to FL environments, adapting them for heterogeneity and privacy through strategies such as weighted binning and federated temperature scaling.

Result: They demonstrated that federated temperature scaling performs best in Differential Privacy (DP) settings, while weighted binning excels without DP.

Conclusion: Federated calibration methods improve reliability in privacy-sensitive applications, addressing heterogeneity challenges effectively.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PepCompass, a geometry-aware framework that uses novel methods for peptide exploration and optimization, leading to the discovery of highly active broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address challenges in discovering antimicrobial peptides, stemming from the vast size of peptide space and the scarcity of active peptides. Conventional generative models are limited by geometric distortions, inefficiencies, and assumptions of fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which fail for peptide data.

Method: The authors propose PepCompass, a framework based on the Union of $
abla$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds to capture local geometry. They introduce two exploration methods: Second-Order Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling and Mutation Enumeration in Tangent Space, combining these into Local Enumeration Bayesian Optimization (LE-BO) for local activity optimization. Additionally, they develop Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS) for interpolating prototypes along activity-biased geodesics.

Result: Using the PepCompass approach, in-vitro validation yielded four novel peptide seeds, and optimization discovered 25 peptides with high activity, effective against broad-spectrum, including resistant bacterial strains.

Conclusion: Geometry-informed exploration techniques, as demonstrated by PepCompass, provide an efficient and robust framework for antimicrobial peptide design, advancing the potential for addressing resistant bacterial strains.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

*Guolei Zeng,Hezhe Qiao,Guoguo Ai,Jinsong Guo,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphNC, a framework for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data for improved normality calibration and reduced detection errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection methods tend to overfit to labeled normal nodes, leading to high detection errors such as false positives.

Method: Proposing GraphNC, which includes two components: anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg).

Result: The framework improves the separability of anomaly scores and enhances the compactness of normal node representations.

Conclusion: GraphNC enhances the performance of semi-supervised graph anomaly detection by effectively using labeled and unlabeled data, reducing overfitting and increasing accuracy.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on mitigating bias and improving fairness in AI systems, highlighting its importance both technically and morally.

Method: A tailored contrastive learning framework is proposed, leveraging supervised and self-supervised techniques with strategic sample selection to ensure fair representations in tabular datasets.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces bias compared to state-of-the-art models, maintaining accuracy and suitability for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The study proves the effectiveness of the new framework in achieving fair representation while preserving performance, contributing to fairness in AI systems analyzing tabular data.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Motivation: The motivation is to mathematically model and analyze densely connected DNNs, improving understanding and exploring their training stability in deep-layer limits.

Method: The authors formulate densely connected DNNs using nonlinear integral equations under a Dense Non-local (DNL) framework and leverage $
Gamma$-convergence analysis with optimal control theory for their results.

Result: The study proves convergence results, including the convergence of optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers for densely connected networks.

Conclusion: Densely connected layers in DNNs, modeled within the DNL framework, offer training stability and mathematical rigor, enhancing their applicability in deep learning with broader feature transformations.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li,Shihua Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses enhancing Flow Matching (FM) models for generative tasks by addressing train-inference gaps and precision in tasks like robotic manipulation through fine-tuning with Maximum Likelihood Estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models show significant potential in generative tasks like robotic manipulation. However, the inability to assess outputs during training and their tendency to over-focus on straight predefined paths lead to issues such as precision gaps and system stiffness.

Method: The authors analyze the theoretical link between FM's training loss and inference error. They propose fine-tuning FM using Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions, introducing both straightforward and residual-based fine-tuning. The latter integrates the contraction property for robustness.

Result: Experiments in image generation and robotic manipulation confirm that the proposed methods enhance the inference performance of FM models.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning via Maximum Likelihood Estimation makes Flow Matching models more robust, interpretable, and effective, particularly in high-precision tasks like robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Result: CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance in single and multi-concept personalization tasks, requiring minimal parameter adjustments and outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: CNS is an effective continual learning strategy for diffusion models that balances quality, memory efficiency, and processing speed, enabling practical personalization use cases.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

### [346] [KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02084)
*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Zheya Wang,Hongxiao Li,Yifan Wang,Lei Wang,Chunjie Luo,Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAIROS is a non-autoregressive forecasting framework for web application time series, which avoids prediction errors and improves efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable time series forecasts are crucial for efficient resource planning and real-time decision-making in the ever-evolving web environment.

Method: KAIROS utilizes a non-autoregressive design to model segment-level multi-peak distributions, avoiding error accumulation and enabling just-in-time inference.

Result: KAIROS achieves strong zero-shot generalization, delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while being more cost-efficient.

Conclusion: Non-autoregressive frameworks like KAIROS are scalable and essential for foundation models in time series forecasting.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

### [347] [Equilibrium Matching: Generative Modeling with Implicit Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300)
*Runqian Wang,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Matching (EqM) is a new generative modeling framework leveraging equilibrium dynamics instead of traditional time-based approaches to achieve superior image generation performance and flexible task handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations and inefficiencies in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models, and to explore equilibrium dynamics for better generative modeling and task handling.

Method: EqM learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, enabling optimization-based sampling through gradient descent with adjustable step sizes and adaptive compute.

Result: EqM achieves state-of-the-art performance, including an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256, and supports tasks like image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition.

Conclusion: EqM effectively builds a connection between flow and energy-based models, offering superior performance and versatility in generative tasks and optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

*Damian Falk,Konstantin Schürholt,Konstantinos Tzevelekakis,Léo Meynent,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses weight space learning by using unstructured, heterogeneous models from repositories like Hugging Face instead of curated model zoos, achieving competitive performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weight space learning methods demand curated model zoos, requiring significant computational resources and limiting scalability and flexibility.

Method: The authors proposed a weight space learning backbone trained on diverse, unstructured, and heterogeneous models from open repositories like Hugging Face, which vary in architecture and dataset.

Result: The developed backbone achieves strong performance, often surpassing backbones trained on curated model zoos, and generalizes well to unseen data modalities due to the diversity of training weights.

Conclusion: Curated model zoos are not essential for high-quality weight space learning. This work opens weight space learning to broader and more flexible applications via unstructured model repositories.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

*Klaus-Rudolf Kladny,Bernhard Schölkopf,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PENEX is a new variation of multi-class exponential loss that is optimized using first-order methods, demonstrating strong regularization and empirical success across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost uses exponential loss for training weak learners but generalizes well despite penalizing mislabeled data harshly. There is a need for a theoretically grounded, optimization-friendly formulation.

Method: Propose Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new loss function optimized via first-order methods, maximizing data point margins and parameterizing weak learners through gradient increments.

Result: PENEX empirically and theoretically shows implicit regularization and is effective in computer vision and language tasks, often outperforming existing methods with similar costs.

Conclusion: PENEX serves as an AdaBoost-inspired, theoretically grounded option for efficient training and fine-tuning of deep networks with strong regularization properties.

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

*Milad Firoozeh,Nader Dashti,Mohammad Ali Hatefi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes residential gas consumption in Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models like LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost. The hybrid model proved most accurate in predicting consumption patterns and handling limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from Iran's challenges with gas pressure drops and outages during cold seasons due to increasing population and residential energy usage, necessitating consumption control strategies.

Method: Machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost, were trained on six years of gas consumption and meteorological data to predict residential gas usage.

Result: The hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model outperformed other models with lower RMSE, MAPE, and MPE values, demonstrating accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: Machine learning, especially hybrid approaches, effectively predicts and manages residential gas consumption, emphasizing the importance of geographical and climatic factors for efficient resource management and addressing seasonal shortages.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

*Samhita Pal,James O'quinn,Kaveh Aryan,Heather Pua,James P. Long,Amir Asiaee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DECOR, a differentiable estimator for learning DAGs and noise models in linear Gaussian SEMs with latent confounding, achieving strong performance under varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structure learning in linear Gaussian SEMs either depend on assuming independent errors or require strong, restrictive priors like pervasive factor structures. The authors aim to address these gaps by developing a method suitable across a broader range of settings, especially under less pervasive confounding.

Method: The authors propose DECOR, a likelihood-based estimator that simultaneously learns both the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a correlated noise model. It combines smooth acyclic updates for graph learning with convex updates for noise estimation, introducing conditions to ensure parameter identifiability.

Result: DECOR achieves competitive or superior results compared to existing benchmarks across scenarios with varying confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimensionality, showing particular strength in non-pervasive confounding settings.

Conclusion: DECOR provides a robust, effective framework for structure learning in the presence of latent confounding, filling a gap in existing methods with its global identifiability and practical performance.

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

TL;DR: This paper presents Catalyst GFlowNet, a machine learning generative model that designs crystal surfaces for efficient energy storage via hydrogen. It successfully identifies platinum as the best-known catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of developing affordable and high-performance electrocatalysts essential for hydrogen energy storage, a vital component for stabilizing renewable energy supply.

Method: The authors introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model using machine learning predictors to design crystal surfaces optimized for their formation and adsorption energy as catalysts.

Result: The model successfully identifies platinum as the most efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Future applications include extending this to oxygen evolution reactions and discovering new materials.

Conclusion: Catalyst GFlowNet offers a promising generative modeling framework that accelerates the discovery of novel and efficient catalysts, contributing significantly to renewable energy solutions.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

### [353] [Policy Gradient Guidance Enables Test Time Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02148)
*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), extending classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to policy gradient methods, enabling behavior modulation at test time without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the advantages of classifier-free guidance mechanisms, previously applied in diffusion models, into classical policy gradient methods for better controllability and efficiency in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose an augmentation of the policy gradient formula with an unconditional branch, mixing it with the conditional branch, adding a test-time control parameter. They theoretically prove the update's validity under advantage estimation and test it empirically in discrete and continuous control tasks.

Result: PGG improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability in reinforcement learning tasks. While dropout improves performance in discrete low-sample settings, it destabilizes continuous control. Using larger guidance ($\gamma > 1$) mitigates these issues.

Conclusion: Policy Gradient Guidance effectively extends classifier-free guidance principles to on-policy reinforcement learning methods, improving controllability and opening new research directions in online learning.

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE uses Large Language Models to derive interpretable reward functions from expert demonstrations, producing code-based, inspectable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse reinforcement learning methods produce opaque reward models that are challenging to interpret or debug.

Method: GRACE employs evolutionary search and Large Language Models to generate executable, interpretable code for reward functions from expert trajectories.

Result: GRACE showed high accuracy in learning rewards on BabyAI and AndroidWorld, outperforming competitive methods and excelling in multi-task scenarios.

Conclusion: GRACE delivers interpretable and effective reward functions, advancing the state-of-the-art in inverse reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on leveraging electrocardiograms (ECGs) to identify Chagas disease, aiding diagnostic prioritization due to limited serological testing capacities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chagas disease poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular and digestive complications, yet diagnostic tools like serological tests are limited. ECG manifestations of Chagas cardiomyopathy offer a non-invasive approach for disease identification.

Method: The paper utilized a combination of datasets with weak and strong labels, augmented data for robust modeling, and applied a triage-focused evaluation metric to develop machine learning algorithms for electrocardiogram-based disease detection.

Result: A large-scale competition attracted over 630 participants from 111 teams, resulting in the submission of more than 1300 entries showcasing diverse algorithmic approaches.

Conclusion: The innovation and collaboration demonstrated by the Challenge highlight the feasibility and promise of ECG-based detection methods for Chagas disease.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

### [356] [Poolformer: Recurrent Networks with Pooling for Long-Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02206)
*Daniel Gallo Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that uses pooling and recurrent layers instead of self-attention to handle very long sequences, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of self-attention in handling very long sequences due to its quadratic scaling with sequence length while maintaining performance across applications like NLP, vision, and audio.

Method: The proposed method, Poolformer, replaces self-attention with recurrent layers and employs pooling operations for sequence length reduction. It is built using SkipBlocks, which combine pooling layers, nested structures, and residual blocks iteratively.

Result: The model accelerates training, enhances perceptual metrics like FID and IS, successfully avoids overfitting, and handles both short-term and long-range dependencies effectively. It outperforms current state-of-the-art models on raw audio tasks.

Conclusion: Poolformer is promising for tasks involving long sequences, demonstrating strong performance in audio and potential applications in text, vision, and multi-modal processing.

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces StockBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in realistic stock trading environments, highlighting their challenges and potential in financial decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in evaluating LLMs specifically in the finance domain, focusing on dynamic stock trading tasks rather than just static financial knowledge.

Method: They developed StockBench, a benchmark that tests LLM agents in simulated multi-month stock trading scenarios using daily market signals and evaluates them with financial performance metrics like cumulative return and Sortino ratio.

Result: Evaluation of LLMs showed that most struggled to outperform a simple buy-and-hold investment strategy, but some models showed promise in achieving higher returns and better risk management.

Conclusion: The study underscores the challenges LLMs face in real-world trading but also points to their potential advancements. StockBench is released open-source to spur further research in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiFFPO, a unified framework for training diffusion large language models (dLLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) for faster and better reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dLLMs by addressing inefficiencies and improving both reasoning speed and performance using a unified RL-driven approach.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage likelihood approximation combined with off-policy RL and importance sampling correction for efficiency. They also introduce joint training of samplers/controllers for dLLMs to dynamically allocate inference thresholds.

Result: DiFFPO achieves superior task performance with improved sample efficiency and reduced inference-time compute through joint sampler training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates better performance and efficiency, as evident in benchmark math and planning tasks, pushing the Pareto frontier for dLLMs' compute-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in large-scale recommendation models caused by data heterogeneity by introducing a method (C2AL) involving auxiliary learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation models inherently assume homogeneity in user populations, which is unrealistic given the heterogeneous datasets that dominate real-world applications. This leads to central distribution bias, neglecting minority cohorts and limiting model performance.

Method: The authors propose an approach using substructure analysis and auxiliary learning. They expose distributional contrasts with partially conflicting auxiliary labels to optimize shared attention layers and mutual information, thereby balancing minority cohort performance with global optimization.

Result: The method, called C2AL, was evaluated on large-scale datasets and six state-of-the-art models. It achieved up to 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy and over 0.30% improvement for minority cohorts.

Conclusion: C2AL enhances factorization machines by improving their ability to capture granular patterns. It successfully balances global model performance with minority user representation, offering an effective solution to data imbalance issues in large-scale recommender systems.

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

*Runzhe Zhan,Yafu Li,Zhi Wang,Xiaoye Qu,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao,Derek F. Wong,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ExGRPO, a framework to enhance the reasoning capability of large language models by organizing and prioritizing valuable learning experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and instability in standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods during reasoning tasks in large language models.

Method: The authors identify rollout correctness and entropy as indicators of valuable reasoning experiences, proposing ExGRPO which uses these insights for balanced exploration and exploitation via a mixed-policy objective.

Result: ExGRPO improves reasoning performance in benchmarks by an average of +3.5/7.6 points compared to on-policy methods and stabilizes training in both strong and weak models.

Conclusion: Principled experience management is crucial for the efficiency and scalability of reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

*Maximilian Beck,Kajetan Schweighofer,Sebastian Böck,Sebastian Lehner,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares the scaling behaviors of Transformers and xLSTM models, focusing on training/inference efficiency, model sizes, and context lengths, finding xLSTM advantageous as context grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the xLSTM architecture's scaling behavior and efficiency compare to traditional Transformers, particularly in large-scale language model training & inference scenarios.

Method: The authors analyzed scaling using IsoFLOP and parametric fit methods across various model sizes (80M-7B) and training datasets (2B-2T tokens). They also studied optimal model sizes for varying context lengths and evaluated inference-time scaling.

Result: The findings indicate that xLSTM scales more favorably compared to Transformers in typical language model training and inference settings, showing increasing benefits as context length grows.

Conclusion: The xLSTM model is competitive with Transformers and shows superior scaling behavior, especially in scenarios with longer contexts, making it a promising alternative.

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

*Ricardo Misael Ayala Molina,Hyame Assem Alameddine,Makan Pourzandi,Chadi Assi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PUL-Inter-Slice Defender, a machine learning-based anomaly detection system to protect 5G network slices from Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, achieving outstanding detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in 5G networks introduced by Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), which attackers can exploit for Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks.

Method: The authors propose PUL-Inter-Slice Defender, an anomaly detection system utilizing Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL), Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders, and K-Means clustering to identify DSM attack variants.

Result: On a dataset collected from a 5G testbed, the proposed approach achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% even with training datasets containing 10-40% attack contamination, outperforming other solutions.

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender proves effective and robust in detecting DSM attacks in 5G networks, showcasing superiority over existing defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

*Ruohao Guo,Afshin Oroojlooy,Roshan Sridhar,Miguel Ballesteros,Alan Ritter,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DialTree-RPO, a novel framework for identifying multi-turn attacks in language models, significantly outperforming previous methods by employing reinforcement learning and tree search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of efficient methods for discovering and analyzing multi-turn adversarial attacks on large language models, which are increasingly vulnerable in such settings.

Method: The proposed framework, DialTree-RPO, uses on-policy reinforcement learning integrated with tree search to autonomously discover diverse multi-turn attack strategies by modeling dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem.

Result: With this approach, DialTree-RPO achieved a greater than 25.9% higher attack success rate (ASR) across 10 different target models compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, revealing new multi-turn attack strategies.

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO advances the exploration of multi-turn adversarial attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness and necessity in understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

*Wentao Zhang,Yang Young Lu,Yuntian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Interactive Training, a framework enabling real-time intervention in neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training methods lack flexibility to adjust to instabilities or emerging issues.

Method: Interactive Training involves a control server that mediates dynamic adjustments by users or automated agents during training.

Result: The framework achieves better training stability, lower sensitivity to initial settings, and enhanced adaptability.

Conclusion: Interactive Training allows dynamic intervention, setting a foundation for autonomous AI monitoring and optimization of training processes.

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

### [365] [Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259)
*Tobias Kreiman,Yutong Bai,Fadi Atieh,Elizabeth Weaver,Eric Qu,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines whether Transformers, trained directly on Cartesian coordinates without predefined graphs or physical priors, can match the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular energy and force predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of GNNs in molecular modeling, such as fixed receptive fields and slower inference, by exploring whether Transformers can serve as an alternative architecture without relying on predefined graphs.

Method: A standard Transformer model is trained on Cartesian coordinates and evaluated for molecular tasks under matched training compute budgets, compared against a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN using the OMol25 dataset.

Result: Transformers achieve competitive performance in molecular energy and force prediction, learning physically meaningful patterns such as attention decay with distance, and showing scalable improvements with increasing computational resources.

Conclusion: Transformers can adaptively acquire many properties advantageous for molecular tasks traditionally hard-coded into GNNs, offering a scalable and flexible alternative for molecular modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

*Yalin E. Sagduyu,Tugba Erpek,Kemal Davaslioglu,Sastry Kompella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study employs reinforcement learning (RL), including Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), to counteract dynamic reactive jamming and optimize transmitter-receiver throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reactive jamming, where adversaries dynamically adjust strategies to disrupt communications, aiming to ensure effective and resilient data transmissions.

Method: The study uses reinforcement learning techniques, leveraging Q-learning for discrete states and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for continuous power states. It optimizes transmission power, modulation, and channel choices in response to evolving channel and jamming dynamics.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that RL methods effectively adapt to dynamic spectrum conditions and successfully maintain high throughput despite changing jamming policies.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning proves useful in combating reactive jamming by enabling transmitters and receivers to adapt rapidly and sustain communication performance in volatile environments.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

*Kyoungjun Park,Yifan Yang,Changhan Ge,Lili Qiu,Shiqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Diffusion^2, a diffusion-based approach using 3D point clouds to accurately model RF signal propagation with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting RF signal propagation struggle with complex environments due to obstacles like absorption and reflection, limiting their utility.

Method: The proposed method, Diffusion^2, uses a novel RF-3D Encoder to extract RF-specific features from 3D point clouds, leveraging multi-scale embedding to model signal behavior effectively.

Result: Diffusion^2 achieves high accuracy in simulating RF signal dissemination across various conditions, with an error of 1.9 dB and operating 27x faster than existing approaches.

Conclusion: Diffusion^2 significantly advances the prediction of RF signal propagation, enabling faster and more accurate estimations in diverse environments and frequency ranges.

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

*Fedor Velikonivtsev,Oleg Platonov,Gleb Bazhenov,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing large datasets with rich road features for urban road networks and proposes a scalable spatiotemporal model using GNN without a temporal sequence module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic forecasting datasets only cover sparsely located intercity highways, lack realistic urban road features, and fall short in scale compared to real-world scenarios.

Method: They developed large-scale datasets for two cities with detailed road features and presented a scalable GNN model for traffic prediction, omitting temporal sequence processing modules.

Result: The proposed GNN model demonstrated superior scalability and improved forecasting accuracy compared to existing neural spatiotemporal models.

Conclusion: Their datasets and modeling approach address limitations in current traffic forecasting benchmarks and provide valuable resources for future traffic prediction research.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

### [369] [Addressing Pitfalls in the Evaluation of Uncertainty Estimation Methods for Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02279)
*Mykyta Ielanskyi,Kajetan Schweighofer,Lukas Aichberger,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses confabulation issues in large language models (a type of hallucination) caused by predictive uncertainty. It proposes methods to improve the evaluation robustness of uncertainty estimation algorithms by suggesting alternative risk indicators and advocating for Elo ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle the problem of hallucinations in large language models, particularly confabulations, by addressing the limitations of current evaluation methods for predictive uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose alternative methods for evaluating uncertainty estimation in natural language generation. This includes using alternative risk indicators, marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants, exploring structured and out-of-distribution tasks, and applying Elo ratings to summarize performance across evaluations.

Result: The proposed risk indicators and marginalization methods improve the robustness of empirical assessments of uncertainty estimation algorithms. They reduce evaluation biases and make the assessment of LLM uncertainty more reliable.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using diverse risk indicators and Elo ratings provides a more objective and robust evaluation framework for assessing predictive uncertainty in LLMs, particularly in question-answering and beyond.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective solution for identifying student models distilled from teacher models, addressing issues of unauthorized replication.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest

generation. The code is available at

*Dhruv Kohli,Sawyer J. Robertson,Gal Mishne,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGO proposes a spectral method to robustly estimate tangent spaces on noisy data manifolds, outperforming traditional LPCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LPCA in high-noise environments due to its dependency on optimal neighborhood size.

Method: LEGO orthogonalizes gradients of low-frequency Laplacian eigenvectors instead of relying on local neighborhoods.

Result: LEGO achieves noise-robust tangent space estimates and improves manifold learning, boundary detection, and local dimension estimation.

Conclusion: LEGO leverages global data structure, overcoming the trade-offs faced by LPCA and enhancing robustness in manifold analysis tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

*Anna Kuzina,Maciej Pioro,Paul N. Whatmough,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KaVa, a framework that uses compressed KV-cache self-distillation to enhance latent reasoning in LLMs, outperforming current baselines and achieving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and lack of supervision in latent reasoning for complex multi-step problems in large language models.

Method: KaVa distills knowledge from a compressed KV-cache of a teacher model into a latent-reasoning student using self-distillation and latent token alignment.

Result: KaVa outperforms latent baselines, retains accuracy for natural-language traces, scales to larger models, and improves efficiency.

Conclusion: Compressed KV-cache distillation is validated as an effective and scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces "microscaling" floating-point formats to optimize memory and computation for large language models while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models demand substantial computational and memory resources; the study aims to address this inefficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: The authors propose microscaling floating-point formats, using a shared scale across blocks of values, focusing on 8-bit formats. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 architecture to evaluate performance.

Result: Microscaling achieved competitive accuracy in training and inference while significantly reducing memory and computational costs.

Conclusion: Microscaling floating-point formats are a promising resource-efficient method for scaling large language models, with tested efficacy on GPT-2.

Abstract: The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models
(LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without
compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point
formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the
storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in
LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a
dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a
block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while
maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of
microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly
reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several
configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture,
demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy
during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient
alternative for deploying LLMs at scale. The source code is publicly available

TL;DR: VarCoNet is a new self-supervised model for analyzing functional connectomes using resting-state fMRI, showing superior performance in tasks like subject identification and autism classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of inter-individual variability in brain function by considering this variability as meaningful data rather than noise, essential for advancing precision medicine.

Method: VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning with an innovative augmentation strategy based on rs-fMRI signal segmentation. It integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder optimized with robust Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.

Result: VarCoNet demonstrated its superiority, robustness, and interpretability compared to 13 deep learning methods in tasks like subject fingerprinting and ASD classification using diverse datasets and brain parcellations.

Conclusion: VarCoNet is validated as a scalable, interpretative tool for functional connectome extraction, offering enhanced analytical precision for both research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to
precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual
variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an
enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)
extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs
self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional
inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that
generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the
absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel
augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,
VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series

extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning

generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework
for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.

### [375] [Kilometer-Scale GNSS-Denied UAV Navigation via Heightmap Gradients: A Winning System from the SPRIN-D Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01348)
*Michal Werner,David Čapek,Tomáš Musil,Ondřej Franěk,Tomáš Báča,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an onboard UAV system for long-range navigation in GNSS-denied environments using a lightweight drift-correction method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to achieve reliable UAV navigation in GNSS-denied settings, overcoming challenges like odometry drift, lack of loop closures in uncharted terrain, and limited computational resources.

Method: The system integrates LiDAR-based local heightmap matching with prior geo-data maps, using gradient-template matching and evidence fusion in a particle filter, running on CPU-only hardware.

Result: The system demonstrated successful multi-kilometer flights across diverse terrain, substantially reducing odometry drift and operating in real time during a competition.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical and effective system for GNSS-denied UAV operations, sharing insights for future advancements in autonomous UAV navigation.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

*Alejandro Gonzalez-Garcia,Wei Xiao,Wei Wang,Alejandro Astudillo,Wilm Decré,Jan Swevers,Carlo Ratti,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a motion planning strategy for autonomous vessels using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), employing adaptive obstacle inflation for reduced conservativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in computational efficiency and overly conservative designs in motion planning for autonomous vessels navigating narrow waterways.

Method: The approach combines MPC to generate motion plans with high-order CBFs for safety. Obstacle representation uses a time-varying inflated ellipse where inflation radii adapt based on vessel-obstacle dynamics.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments proved the strategy effectively navigates narrow spaces, resolves deadlocks, and ensures safety in real-time.

Conclusion: The method improves motion planning efficiency and safety while reducing conservativeness, facilitating autonomous navigation in confined waterways.

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

### [377] [A Stochastic Framework for Continuous-Time State Estimation of Continuum Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01381)
*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots using factor-graph optimization with white noise Gaussian process to handle external disturbances and high-rate sensing efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state estimation methods for continuum robots struggle with computational complexity, oversimplified shape approximations, and susceptibility to unmodeled disturbances.

Method: The approach uses continuous-time kinematics corrupted by white noise Gaussian processes, paired with high-rate sensing and a sparse factor-graph optimization to estimate pose, velocity, and strain in real-time.

Result: The method achieves high adaptability to external forces and data dropout, providing accurate mean and covariance for robotic states that can be interpolated in both time and space.

Conclusion: This framework is efficient, versatile, and robust, showing promise for real-world applications with linear computational complexity and constant-time interpolation.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

### [378] [VENTURA: Adapting Image Diffusion Models for Unified Task Conditioned Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01388)
*Arthur Zhang,Xiangyun Meng,Luca Calliari,Dong-Ki Kim,Shayegan Omidshafiei,Joydeep Biswas,Ali Agha,Amirreza Shaban*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VENTURA is a vision-language navigation system that finetunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models to generate path masks for robot navigation, significantly enhancing performance and safety in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome challenges in using recent vision-language models for robotic navigation, addressing their limitations in action space compatibility and pretraining objectives.

Method: VENTURA leverages image diffusion models to create path masks as visual plans, supervised by self-supervised tracking models and VLM-augmented captions, and grounds these plans with a behavior-cloning policy for robot execution.

Result: VENTURA significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in tasks like object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54%.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates improved safety, performance, and generalization in robot navigation, revealing emergent compositional capabilities for unseen task combinations.

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

### [379] [INSIGHT: INference-time Sequence Introspection for Generating Help Triggers in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01389)
*Ulas Berk Karli,Ziyao Shangguan,Tesca FItzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces INSIGHT, a system to improve Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by allowing them to predict when they might fail and need human assistance, using token-level uncertainty signals and transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLA models show strong generalization, they currently lack mechanisms to anticipate potential failures and request timely human help, thus necessitating introspection capabilities for error mitigation.

Method: The INSIGHT framework extracts per-token uncertainty metrics (like entropy, log-probability, and aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty estimates) and leverages transformers to interpret these as triggers for help requests. The system is tested under different supervision regimes.

Result: The framework reveals a trade-off: strong supervision allows for precise uncertainty modeling, while weak labels still achieve competitive performance when aligned with training, providing a scalable alternative. Temporal modeling of token-level uncertainty outperformed static approaches.

Conclusion: INSIGHT represents the first comprehensive study of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, showing that appropriate uncertainty modeling can enhance real-time decision-making, active learning, and human intervention strategies in dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

### [380] [Beyond Collision Cones: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Nonholonomic Robots via Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01402)
*Hun Kuk Park,Taekyung Kim,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The authors introduce a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) to improve the safety and feasibility of autonomous robots in dense and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing CBF approaches for nonholonomic robots face limitations in dense environments as collision-cone approaches are overly conservative and can become infeasible.

Method: The authors propose DPCBF, which uses a dynamically adaptable parabolic boundary based on distance to obstacles and relative velocity, and validate its effectiveness on a kinematic bicycle model.

Result: Simulations revealed the DPCBF-based controller improved navigation and QP feasibility, successfully navigating scenarios with up to 100 dynamic obstacles where previous methods failed.

Conclusion: DPCBF is an effective method for addressing safety and feasibility challenges in dynamic environments for autonomous nonholonomic robots.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

### [381] [How Well do Diffusion Policies Learn Kinematic Constraint Manifolds?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01404)
*Lexi Foland,Thomas Cohn,Adam Wei,Nicholas Pfaff,Boyuan Chen,Russ Tedrake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines how diffusion policies perform in robot imitation learning, especially in satisfying kinematic constraints, using a bimanual pick-and-place task. It highlights factors like data size, quality, and manifold curvature, finding that dataset parameters influence learning while curvature effects are inconclusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess whether diffusion policies can precisely learn constraints in training data, as task performance alone doesn't reliably measure constraint learning. The study aims to understand how external factors like dataset size, quality, and manifold curvature impact this.

Method: Researchers conducted a case study using a bimanual pick-and-place robotic task requiring kinematic constraint fulfillment. They analyzed the effects of dataset size, quality, and manifold curvature on policy learning and performed experiments, including hardware evaluations.

Result: The findings reveal that diffusion policies approximate constraint manifolds coarsely, with reduced dataset size and quality negatively impacting learning. However, there were inconclusive correlations between manifold curvature, constraint satisfaction, and task success.

Conclusion: Diffusion policies show potential but are influenced by data quality and size, and their ability to learn constraint manifolds may depend heavily on training data preparation. Real-world evaluations affirm its practical applications while highlighting limitations with curvature impact.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

### [382] [Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01986)
*Varun Kotian,Vishrut Jain,Andrea Michelle Rios Lazcano,Daan Marinus Pool,Riender Happee,Barys Shyrokau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a motion cueing algorithm to enhance driving simulator experience by reducing motion sickness using model predictive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driving simulators often cause motion sickness due to mismatched motion and visual cues, limiting their usability in research and development.

Method: The paper uses model predictive control (MPC) to design an algorithm that penalizes sensory conflict and specific force errors, enabling a balance between fidelity and comfort.

Result: Four experimental scenarios were tested; the compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% without significant reduction in fidelity compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MPC-based approach significantly improves driving simulator usability by minimizing motion sickness while maintaining fidelity, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT is a vision-based robot learning framework that extracts semantic 2D keypoints to improve manipulation efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of dense visual inputs and lack of scalability in keypoint-based approaches for robotic manipulation.

Method: Introduces a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering, category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning with embedded gating.

Result: AFFORD2ACT achieves an 82% success rate on diverse and unseen tasks, while being lightweight and efficient to train and operate.

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT provides a scalable, real-time, and semantically driven approach to vision-based robotic manipulation using a compact state representation.

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

TL;DR: This paper presents a trajectory optimization framework for robotic powder transportation, integrating advanced modeling and refinement strategies to enhance accuracy and stability, outperforming reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The precise manipulation of powders in laboratory workflows, which is challenging and critical for scientific discovery, remains a limitation in robotic automation.

Method: The proposed framework uses differentiable physics simulation for granular dynamics, low-dimensional skill-space parameterization for reduced optimization complexity, and a curriculum-based refinement strategy for long-horizon tasks.

Result: The framework achieves higher task success rates and stability when compared to a reinforcement learning baseline in experimental validations.

Conclusion: The trajectory optimization approach effectively enhances robotic performance in powder transport, demonstrating potential for broader application in laboratory automation.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: The study introduces a cooperative robotic system with haptic feedback to aid surgeons in identifying tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery, evaluating its effectiveness through simulated resections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delineating tumors during breast-conserving surgery is challenging due to their mobility, non-palpability, and irregular borders. Addressing these difficulties could improve surgical outcomes.

Method: A small haptic robot equipped with an electrocautery blade was integrated with ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation for tumor identification. Virtual fixtures guided the surgical tool during simulated resections by users.

Result: Haptic guidance improved resection margins and reduced users' mental demand, frustration, and effort. Adjustments to the system and training protocols were identified based on how it impacts surgical workflows.

Conclusion: The cooperative robotic system shows promise in aiding tumor localization during breast-conserving surgery, requiring further validation and system refinement through extensive user studies.

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental limitations in existing Vision-Language Models in robot navigation, such as lack of persistent memory, limited spatial reasoning, and inefficiency in handling long video durations for real-time applications.

Method: VL-KnG constructs spatiotemporal knowledge graphs to maintain object identity and allows spatial reasoning through queryable graph structures. It processes data in chunks using modern VLMs and demonstrates efficacy using the WalkieKnowledge benchmark and real-world robot tests.

Result: VL-KnG achieves a 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy in navigation tasks, performing at par with Gemini 2.5 Pro, but with added benefits of explainable reasoning, computational efficiency, and adaptability across localization, navigation, and planning tasks.

Conclusion: VL-KnG is a robust system for robot navigation that employs explainable, persistent scene understanding and is computationally efficient for real-time use. It effectively addresses limitations of traditional VLMs and performs well in practical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal
identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing
modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity
over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph
structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a

achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for pose estimation of a free-floating robot using unscented Kalman filter with Gaussian process residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to achieve accurate pose estimation for a minimally sensed, underactuated multi-link robot inspired by biology.

Method: The researchers utilized an unscented Kalman filter paired with Gaussian process residual learning, verified through hardware experiments and offline Kalman filter analysis.

Result: They demonstrated reliable pose estimation and showed that a filter trained on diverse gait datasets performs comparably to one with a larger forward-gait-only dataset.

Conclusion: The study highlights that gait input space overlaps, allowing for reduced training dataset size and improved filter generalizability across various gaits.

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical navigation framework for robots in complex indoor environments, addressing challenges in existing methods using neural fields and physics-informed strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations such as spectral bias, catastrophic forgetting, and the need for extensive demonstration data in current robotic navigation methodologies.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical approach with a high-level sparse graph for global connectivity and a low-level neural field-based planner solving the Eikonal PDE for local obstacle navigation.

Result: The proposed framework improves adaptability and precision in large-scale environments, surpassing previous navigation methods.

Conclusion: This new approach offers a reliable solution for online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation in complex and unknown environments.

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

Method: The paper presents a GPU-based framework combining vertex-based connected component labeling, RANSAC-based plane detection, and convex hull for segmenting planes in 3D voxel maps.

Result: The method achieves fast and precise 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz with high resolution, validated in both simulated and physical robot environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses real-time 3D planar mapping challenges, demonstrating robust performance for legged robot locomotion.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

### [390] [MiniBEE: A New Form Factor for Compact Bimanual Dexterity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01603)
*Sharfin Islam,Zewen Chen,Zhanpeng He,Swapneel Bhatt,Andres Permuy,Brock Taylor,James Vickery,Pedro Piacenza,Cheng Zhang,Matei Ciocarlie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiniBEE, a compact bimanual robot end-effector system with reduced degrees of freedom that enhances dexterity, mobility, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome dexterity limitations and high complexity of traditional bimanual robot manipulators, aiming to enlarge workspace and create a lightweight wearable system.

Method: Developed MiniBEE with reduced mobility arms (3+ DOF each) coupled into a kinematic chain, introducing a kinematic dexterity metric for design optimization to maximize the dexterous workspace.

Result: MiniBEE provides wearable kinesthetic data collection and can extend dexterity when mounted on a standard robot arm, demonstrating robust bimanual manipulation using imitation learning policies and an optimized design.

Conclusion: The proposed MiniBEE system balances dexterity, simplicity, and usability, offering a novel approach to bimanual manipulation with reduced system complexity and enhanced adaptability.

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveUMI is a VR-based system for transferring human demonstration data to robots, excelling in bimanual manipulation tasks with strong generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn complex, generalizable bimanual manipulation tasks efficiently from human demonstrations using portable and scalable systems.

Method: ActiveUMI integrates a portable VR teleoperation kit, sensorized controllers for pose alignment, immersive 3D rendering, wearable computers, and records egocentric perception through a head-mounted display to link visual attention with manipulation.

Result: Policies trained on ActiveUMI data achieved 70% success on in-distribution tasks and 56% success on tasks involving novel objects and environments.

Conclusion: Portable and immersive data collection systems, combined with active perception learning, enable the creation of generalized and capable robot manipulation policies.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual
manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized
controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot
kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a
self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods.
ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

*Zijun Lin,Jiafei Duan,Haoquan Fang,Dieter Fox,Ranjay Krishna,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FailSafe, a system for robotic failure generation and recovery, paired with actionable recovery data; experimental results show significant improvements in failure handling and overall task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling robotic systems to reason about and recover from failures during manipulation, especially as current datasets lack executable recovery actions.

Method: The FailSafe system automatically generates diverse failure scenarios along with executable recovery actions for manipulation tasks in any simulator. It fine-tunes the LLaVa-OneVision-7B VLM to enhance failure recovery capabilities.

Result: The fine-tuned FailSafe-VLM improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models by an average of 22.6% and demonstrates robustness across various spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robot designs.

Conclusion: The FailSafe system significantly enhances robotic failure recovery, providing a scalable and generalizable solution for improving robotic task execution. The authors will release the FailSafe code to benefit the wider community.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

### [393] [Statistical Uncertainty Learning for Robust Visual-Inertial State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01648)
*Seungwon Choi,Donggyu Park,Seo-Yeon Hwang,Tae-Wan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an online statistical framework for dynamically assessing sensor measurement reliability in visual-inertial odometry (VIO), resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the limitation of conventional methods in robust VIO, which assume static, uniform measurement uncertainties and fail to adapt to real-world dynamic error characteristics.

Method: A statistical framework using self-supervised multi-view geometric consistency to learn and adapt landmark uncertainty for weighting visual measurements dynamically during optimization.

Result: On the EuRoC dataset, the proposed method reduced translation error by 24% and rotation error by 42% compared to baseline approaches, all while operating in real-time.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of VIO, advancing state estimation by adapting to dynamic uncertainties; the source code will be publicly available to foster further research.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

*Yifei Simon Shao,Yuchen Zheng,Sunan Sun,Pratik Chaudhari,Vijay Kumar,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SymSkill combines imitation learning and task-and-motion planning to enable real-time multi-step manipulation and failure recovery in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in imitation learning (lack of compositional generalization) and classical task-and-motion planning (prohibitive planning latency) for multi-step manipulation.

Method: SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills from unlabeled demonstrations, and uses a symbolic planner to reorder and compose skills during execution. It supports real-time recovery and uses a compliant controller for safe execution.

Result: SymSkill achieves an 85% success rate for 12 single-step tasks in RoboCasa simulation and composes multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions. It also demonstrates strong real-world performance on a Franka robot.

Conclusion: SymSkill offers a unified framework enabling compositional generalization and robust recovery in manipulation tasks, bridging the gap between imitation learning and task-and-motion planning.

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

### [395] [Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01675)
*Jaewoo Lee,Dongjae Lee,Jinwoo Lee,Hyungyu Lee,Yeonjoon Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust geometric backstepping controller for variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotors, showing improved tracking and stability even under actuator uncertainties and aggressive flight conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reliability and efficiency of multirotors during demanding maneuvers by incorporating actuator dynamics into control design, which has been neglected or oversimplified in previous approaches.

Method: Cascade structure of rigid-body dynamics and nonlinear actuator dynamics is leveraged to design a geometric backstepping controller with exponential stability. Experimental validation was performed under different scenarios.

Result: The proposed controller outperformed a baseline that ignored actuator dynamics, achieving better tracking and completing all scenarios successfully, including recovery and high-speed maneuvers where the baseline failed.

Conclusion: The controller effectively improves multirotor performance and robustness, especially during aggressive operations and actuator-induced nonlinearities, proving its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Zixing Lei,Zibo Zhou,Sheng Yin,Yueru Chen,Qingyao Xu,Weixin Li,Yunhong Wang,Bowei Tang,Wei Jing,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolySim, a platform that uses multiple simulators during training to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world humanoid control, showcasing substantial improvements in performance and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the sim-to-real gap in training whole-body control policies for humanoids, a challenge caused by inherent biases and limitations of single simulators.

Method: The PolySim platform enables training across multiple simulators concurrently, allowing dynamics-level domain randomization to reduce simulator-specific biases.

Result: Experiments demonstrated significantly reduced motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim tests, enhanced success rates (e.g., 52.8% improvement on MuJoCo), and zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1 robot without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PolySim effectively mitigates simulator biases, facilitates better generalization to new dynamics, and represents a step forward for real-world robotic applications. The authors plan to release its code upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL) for Vision-Language-Action models, which enhances robot manipulation by improving sensitivity to proprioceptive states and control actions, leading to better performance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at processing visual and language data for robot manipulation but lack strong alignment with robotic signals like control actions. The authors aim to address this gap and improve representation quality in VLA models.

Method: The paper proposes the RS-CL method to align VLA model representations with a robot's proprioceptive states using a contrastive loss. This involves soft supervision based on relative distances between states and is added as a regularization method in the training pipeline.

Result: The RS-CL technique significantly boosts VLA model performance in robot manipulation tasks. Empirical results show a jump in success rates for pick-and-place tasks (30.8% to 41.5%) and improvements in real-robot tasks (45.0% to 58.3%), highlighting better positioning during delicate operations.

Conclusion: RS-CL, as a lightweight addition, enhances the control-relevant representations of VLA models, making them more effective for robot manipulation. This method is adaptable and improves task success rates, demonstrating its practical relevance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Magnetic Continuum Robot (MCR) design that achieves both bending and torsion motions using radial magnet embedding for minimally invasive medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current axial magnet designs in MCRs have limited deformation capabilities, restricting their role in intricate anatomical navigation and therapy delivery.

Method: The authors embed permanent magnets radially within the catheter wall and combine physics-based formulations, finite-element analysis, benchtop experiments, and a dual-layer blockage mechanism to explore controlled bending and torsion.

Result: The benchtop experiments demonstrate independent mode control, while an in-phantom trial validates end-to-end operation including targeted drug release.

Conclusion: The compact and cable-free MCR platform achieves versatile deformation and precise payload delivery, making it promising for advanced site-specific medical therapies.

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-ACES, a scalable solution to the Smart Factory Embedding problem, which assigns processes and transport plans for manufacturing in smart factories with hundreds of machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFE solvers cannot scale beyond a few dozen machines, while modern smart factories often have hundreds, necessitating a more scalable solution.

Method: The authors developed TS-ACES, a Traffic System-based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, to address the complexity of assigning processes and transportation in large-scale smart factories.

Result: TS-ACES is shown to be complete and capable of handling SFE scenarios involving more than 100 machines, based on real industrial use cases.

Conclusion: The proposed TS-ACES approach successfully bridges the gap in scalability, enabling the embedding of manufacturing procedures into large modern smart factories.

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work introduces Nav-EE, a navigation-aware early-exit framework that reduces latency in Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving by leveraging task-specific exit layers dynamically guided by navigation priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference latency in Vision-Language Models is a significant obstacle for their real-time deployment in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The authors propose Nav-EE, which precomputes task-specific early-exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online using navigation priors, thereby predicting relevant tasks based on upcoming driving contexts.

Result: Nav-EE achieves similar accuracy to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%, with real-vehicle tests showing latency reductions from 600ms to 300ms.

Conclusion: Coupling navigation foresight with early-exit mechanisms enables efficient deployment of large Vision-Language Models in real-world autonomous systems, improving decision-making in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of RL-based ObjectNav systems, identifying perception quality and test-time strategies as key performance drivers, and sets new SotA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of unified analysis in RL-based ObjectNav systems to determine which components drive performance effectively.

Method: Conduct a large-scale empirical study, decomposing systems into perception, policy, and test-time components, and testing controlled experiments.

Result: The study finds perception quality and test-time enhancements drive performance, while policy improvements show marginal gains. It achieves a 6.6% SPL and 2.7% success rate improvement over SotA.

Conclusion: The work offers practical guidelines for enhanced ObjectNav systems, sets new SotA benchmarks, and highlights the performance gap between RL agents and humans.

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

*Wanyue Li,Ji Ma,Minghao Lu,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spatial-temporal trajectory planning method for humanoid robots to achieve efficient and precise soccer-kicking motions, addressing stability and foot-environment interaction issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots face challenges in performing aggressive kicking motions with precision while maintaining stability. Existing methods, including traditional control and reinforcement learning, are limited. Model predictive control (MPC) shows potential but is constrained by oversimplified trajectory models, reducing environmental interaction capabilities.

Method: The study adapts a spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, commonly used in drones, to bipedal robots. This method autonomously generates foot trajectories for kicking, adhering to constraints on position, velocity, and acceleration while optimizing swing phase duration.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach replicates human-like kicking behavior, including backswing motions. Simulations and hardware tests achieve trajectory planning times below 1 ms and nearly 100% accuracy for tasks within a soccer goal range of -90° to 90°.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory planning method offers a reliable, efficient approach to improving humanoid robot kicking capabilities, closely resembling human motion and achieving high task accuracy.

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Method: The framework uses radiance field methods for photorealistic asset generation from RGB images and integrates them into ROS-based simulations.

Result: GreenhouseSplat provides a dataset of 82 cucumber plants, enabling realistic robotics evaluation in simulated greenhouse environments.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a foundation for more accurate and scalable research in greenhouse robotics simulations.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

### [404] [TACOS: Task Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01869)
*Alessandro Nazzari,Roberto Rubinacci,Marco Lovera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACOS, a framework for natural language control of multi-UAV systems using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing multi-drone systems requires flexible interaction frameworks that can manage various autonomy levels, from direct control to autonomous behaviors. Enhancing this with language models can reduce pilot workload and improve task delegation.

Method: The authors propose a system called TACOS, which integrates a natural language interface, a task-coordinating module, and an autonomous agent. It uses LLMs to translate user inputs into task plans and execute them via executable APIs.

Result: TACOS was demonstrated in real-world multi-drone systems, and its effectiveness was assessed through an ablation study analyzing the contributions of each module.

Conclusion: TACOS successfully enables intuitive, high-level natural language interaction for managing multi-drone systems, leveraging LLMs for enhanced coordination and autonomy.

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

*Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARC is a 3-DoF spine module for quadruped robots enabling adjustable stiffness and damping. It combines revolute and prismatic motion along with impedance control, validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a compact and efficient spine module for quadruped robots to better understand and enable compliance in legged locomotion.

Method: The system integrates torque-controlled actuators, a control board, and a power unit. It employs a computed-acceleration controller with friction compensation for spring-damper behavior.

Result: Bench experiments demonstrated linear force-displacement characteristics with high precision and dynamic trials confirmed the system's effective spring-damper response. This module shows enhanced performance in stiffness variability and damping control.

Conclusion: SPARC offers a robust, open-source platform for studying spine compliance in robotic locomotion, with all hardware and software resources made available for further research and development.

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

*Lingxiang Hu,Naima Ait Oufroukh,Fabien Bonardi,Raymond Ghandour*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces EC3R-SLAM, a novel, efficient monocular dense SLAM framework that operates calibration-free, achieves competitive accuracy, low latency, and minimal GPU memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular dense SLAM systems suffer from drawbacks including high latency, excessive GPU memory usage, and dependency on camera calibration, limiting their usability in resource-constrained environments.

Method: EC3R-SLAM is designed with a sparse feature-point tracking module and a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics, alongside local and global loop closures for robust data association.

Result: Experiments demonstrate EC3R-SLAM's competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them in efficiency while operating on resource-constrained platforms like laptops and Jetson Orin NX.

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM offers a practical solution for real-world robotics by combining robust performance, efficiency, and calibration-free operation, addressing key limitations in existing dense SLAM systems.

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

### [407] [LangGrasp: Leveraging Fine-Tuned LLMs for Language Interactive Robot Grasping with Ambiguous Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02104)
*Yunhan Lin,Wenqi Wu,Zhijie Zhang,Huasong Min*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LangGrasp, a framework that leverages language models to improve robotic grasping in ambiguous instruction scenarios, incorporating environmental information for precise task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-driven robotic grasping methods fail to effectively address ambiguous instructions with implicit intents, limiting their utility in unstructured environments.

Method: The framework combines fine-tuned large language models with a point cloud localization module guided by 2D part segmentation, enabling both coarse-grained and fine-grained grasping.

Result: LangGrasp effectively resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifies critical task components, and selects optimal grasping poses by integrating environmental data.

Conclusion: The framework significantly increases grasping adaptability and efficiency in unstructured environments, advancing the state of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

*Philip Reichenberg,Tim Laue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses improvements in stand-up motions for the NAO humanoid robot in soccer, focusing on compensating joint errors to enhance success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in humanoid soccer must stand up independently during the game to avoid being removed temporarily, necessitating effective stand-up strategies.

Method: The authors refined stand-up motions over six years since 2019, addressing large joint errors by freeing stuck limbs or compensating errors using other joints.

Result: Their stand-up routine significantly improved success rates, with similar outcomes observed in other teams using these motions.

Conclusion: Error compensation in joint execution is crucial for successful stand-up motions, with broader usage across various teams validating the approach.

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

TL;DR: The SCANS system is an electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft robot designed to analyze the spectral properties of objects, enhancing spectral sensing capabilities in soft robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a soft robotic system with enhanced spectral sensing capabilities for object analysis, overcoming limitations of previous systems.

Method: They created SCANS, a soft manipulator that uses soft substrates for spectral sensing, performed material analysis for optimization, and assessed the system's performance through experiments analyzing diverse objects.

Result: The system achieved statistical separation across multiple object types and demonstrated that near-infrared wavelengths are critical for distinguishing visually similar objects.

Conclusion: SCANS advances the functional range of spectral sensing in soft robotics, providing new opportunities for multi-functional sensory modalities. Complete resources for the system are publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and
processing code for the SCANS gripper are accessible at:

*Sara Strakosova,Petr Novak,Petr Kadera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores digital twin technology to optimize disassembly processes, promoting sustainability in recycling and remanufacturing, with a focus on electric vehicle batteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of manufacturers' data sharing limits effective recycling and remanufacturing, crucial under the circular economy framework.

Method: The study uses Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN) representations to extend digital twin capabilities for end-of-life product disassembly.

Result: The application of digital twin technology helps streamline disassembly processes efficiently for various electric vehicle battery types.

Conclusion: Digital twins integrated with Bi-PAN can overcome disassembly challenges, reducing environmental impact and enhancing sustainability in circular economies.

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

*Jialin Gao,Donghao Zhou,Mingjian Liang,Lihao Liu,Chi-Wing Fu,Xiaowei Hu,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DisCo-Layout is introduced for realistic, coherent, and adaptable 3D indoor layouts using physical and semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout synthesis methods often fail at generalization due to fixed datasets and lack robust, flexible refinement tools, resulting in suboptimal outputs.

Method: The framework DisCo-Layout uses separate tools for physical (grid-matching) and semantic (abstract relationships) refinements, integrated within a multi-agent system for coordinated layout refinement.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art results by producing realistic and generalized 3D indoor layouts.

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout effectively tackles limitations of traditional methods in 3D layout creation, combining robust refinement with collaborative and generalizable tools.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

*Yan Miao,Ege Yuceel,Georgios Fainekos,Bardh Hoxha,Hideki Okamoto,Sayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel simulation framework, FalconGym 2.0, and a training algorithm, PGR, enhance visual policy design for aerial navigation, leading to robust and generalizable performance across varying tracks and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art visual policies for aerial navigation often struggle with overfitting to single-track data, leading to performance drops when track geometries vary.

Method: The paper introduces FalconGym 2.0, a simulation framework with Gaussian Splatting and an Edit API, enabling rapid generation of diverse tracks. Additionally, the Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm focuses training on challenging scenarios to boost visual policy capabilities.

Result: The PGR-trained visual policy in FalconGym 2.0 consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high success rates across unseen tracks and robust performance against track perturbations, including zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to hardware.

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0 combined with PGR presents a groundbreaking approach to improve visual policies for aerial navigation, offering generalization, robustness, and real-world performance without per-track retraining.

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

### [413] [Retargeting Matters: General Motion Retargeting for Humanoid Motion Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02252)
*Joao Pedro Araujo,Yanjie Ze,Pei Xu,Jiajun Wu,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of the embodiment gap in humanoid motion tracking by proposing a new retargeting method called General Motion Retargeting (GMR), which outperforms existing methods in robustness and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to overcome the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots, as current solutions often introduce artifacts during the retargeting process, impacting the quality of teleoperation and hierarchical controls.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate the effects of retargeting quality on RL policy performance and propose GMR, a new retargeting method. They compare GMR against two open-source retargeters (PHC and ProtoMotions) and a high-quality closed-source dataset from Unitree using BeyondMimic for policy training.

Result: The experiments show that retargeting artifacts reduce policy robustness, especially for dynamic or lengthy sequences. However, GMR outperforms open-source methods in tracking performance and accurately capturing source motion, achieving results close to high-quality closed-source baselines.

Conclusion: GMR proves to be a superior retargeting approach for motion tracking policies, addressing artifacts and improving both perceptual fidelity and policy success rates without excessive reward engineering.

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The research improves view-invariant imitation learning by incorporating camera extrinsics, boosting generalization in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of imitation learning policies failing to generalize across variable camera viewpoints in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Utilized Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays to condition behavior cloning policies on camera extrinsics in six manipulation tasks across RoboSuite and ManiSkill environments, analyzing robustness under viewpoint shifts.

Result: Conditioning policies on camera extrinsics significantly improved viewpoint robustness in standard policies, eliminating the reliance on static background shortcuts.

Conclusion: Incorporating camera extrinsics enables better generalization in imitation learning, offering robust control using only RGB data without depth. Tasks, demonstrations, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARMADA integrates multi-robot rollout with human-in-the-loop control using FLOAT for efficient policy adaptation, achieving faster learning and reduced human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in imitation learning due to poor policy performance from pretrained models, mixed-quality human demonstrations, and high human supervision needs.

Method: Introduce ARMADA, a multi-robot system equipped with FLOAT for autonomous failure detection and selective human intervention during policy rollout.

Result: FLOAT achieves nearly 95% detection accuracy, outperforming prior methods by 20%. ARMADA improves task success rates by over 4x and reduces human intervention rates by over 2x.

Conclusion: ARMADA represents a scalable and efficient solution for real-world policy adaptation, minimizing human labor and enhancing data acquisition for faster adaptation.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

*Huashan Chen,Zhenyu Qi,Haotang Li,Hong Chen,Jinfu Chen,Kebin Peng,In Kee Kim,Kyu Hyung Lee,Sen He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerfOrch, a multi-stage framework that allocates coding tasks across different LLMs to boost performance compared to single-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on a single model for code generation, ignoring the diversity in computational strengths exhibited by different LLMs across languages and tasks.

Method: PerfOrch dynamically routes tasks among 17 state-of-the-art LLMs based on a structured generate-fix-refine workflow, guided by performance metrics evaluated on benchmarks like HumanEval-X.

Result: PerfOrch achieved correctness rates of 96.22% on HumanEval-X and improved execution speeds for 58.76% of problems, outperforming leading models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: PerfOrch’s adaptive multi-LLM framework significantly enhances correctness and efficiency in coding tasks, providing scalability and adaptability for automated software development.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for
automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore
the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across
programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper
challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage,
performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks
to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our
approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art
LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using
HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness
and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization,
and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language,
development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we
present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each
task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without
requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over
strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37%
on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and
49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance
optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median
speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The
framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing
new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm
for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly
evolving generative AI landscape.

*J. Alexander Curtis,Sharadha Kasiviswanathan,Nasir Eisty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of the "wontfix" label in GitHub repositories, detailing its usage, reasons, and implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact and reasoning behind the "wontfix" label's usage in GitHub repositories, which remains underexplored despite its prevalence.

Method: The authors used a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative analysis of 3,132 popular GitHub repositories with qualitative open coding and thematic analysis to uncover reasons for "wontfix" labeling.

Result: Around 30% of GitHub projects use the "wontfix" label, mainly for user-submitted issues such as bug reports and feature requests. They identified eight common themes for the usage of this label.

Conclusion: The "wontfix" label is an essential management tool but may discourage community participation and reduce transparency. Better understanding its use can improve collaboration in open-source projects.

Abstract: Context: The ``wontfix'' label is a widely used yet narrowly understood tool
in GitHub repositories, indicating that an issue will not be pursued further.
Despite its prevalence, the impact of this label on project management and
community dynamics within open-source software development is not clearly
defined. Objective: This study examines the prevalence and reasons behind
issues being labeled as wontfix across various open-source repositories on
GitHub. Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, we analyze both quantitative
data to assess the prevalence of the wontfix label and qualitative data to
explore the reasoning that it was used. Data were collected from 3,132 of
GitHub's most-popular repositories. Later, we employ open coding and thematic
analysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a
structured understanding of the issue management landscape. Results: Our
findings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the wontfix label to
some issues. These issues most often occur on user-submitted issues for bug
reports and feature requests. The study identified eight common themes behind
labeling issues as wontfix, ranging from user-specific control factors to
maintainer-specific decisions. Conclusions: The wontfix label is a critical
tool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects.
However, it can also discourage community involvement and obscure the
transparency of project management. Understanding these reasons aids project
managers in making informed decisions and fostering efficient collaboration
within open-source communities.

*Yifei Chen,Sarra Habchi,Lili Wei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MIMIC is a novel framework enabling gaming agents to mimic diverse player strategies to improve game testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automated game testing algorithms struggle to account for diverse human gameplay strategies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MIMIC integrates varied personality traits into gaming agents, allowing them to adopt diverse strategies for testing.

Result: MIMIC achieved higher task completion rates, better test coverage, and more diverse solutions in games like Minecraft.

Conclusion: MIMIC enhances the capabilities of gaming agents for automated game testing by mimicking diverse human playstyles.

Abstract: Modern video games pose significant challenges for traditional automated
testing algorithms, yet intensive testing is crucial to ensure game quality. To
address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using
Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However,
these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due
to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar
situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle
to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases.
  In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse
personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming
strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can
achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different
games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a
higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results
highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.

### [419] [FOSS-chain: using blockchain for Open Source Software license compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01740)
*Kypros Iacovou,Georgia M. Kapitsaki,Evangelia Vanezi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The authors introduce FOSS-chain, a blockchain-based platform addressing open source software (OSS) license compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexity and legal disputes arising from compliance and compatibility issues among OSS licenses.

Method: They integrated blockchain technology into a web platform to automate license compliance, focusing on 14 OSS licenses.

Result: The platform was evaluated via a small-scale user study, showing promising preliminary results.

Conclusion: FOSS-chain demonstrates potential for addressing OSS license management in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) is widely used and carries licenses that indicate
the terms under which the software is provided for use, also specifying
modification and distribution rules. Ensuring that users are respecting OSS
license terms when creating derivative works is a complex process. Compliance
issues arising from incompatibilities among licenses may lead to legal
disputes. At the same time, the blockchain technology with immutable entries
offers a mechanism to provide transparency when it comes to licensing and
ensure software changes are recorded. In this work, we are introducing an
integration of blockchain and license management when creating derivative
works, in order to tackle the issue of OSS license compatibility. We have
designed, implemented and performed a preliminary evaluation of FOSS-chain, a
web platform that uses blockchain and automates the license compliance process,
covering 14 OSS licenses. We have evaluated the initial prototype version of
the FOSS-chain platform via a small scale user study. Our preliminary results
are promising, demonstrating the potential of the platform for adaptation on
realistic software systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARENA, a tool for energy consumption measurement of Android apps using hardware-based methods, integrated with IDEs for ease of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately and efficiently measure energy consumption of Android apps in typical usage scenarios.

Method: ARENA integrates with IntelliJ and Android Studio to connect developers and researchers to physical energy measurement devices while offering features like statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization of energy data.

Result: ARENA simplifies the process of measuring energy consumption by enabling seamless integration with IDEs, making it adaptable, reproducible, and reducing the complexity of hardware-based approaches.

Conclusion: ARENA enhances the ability to develop energy-efficient Android apps by bridging the gap between hardware-based energy measurement and the development environment, aiding both developers and researchers.

Abstract: To build energy-efficient apps, there is a need to estimate and analyze their
energy consumption in typical usage scenarios. The energy consumption of
Android apps could be estimated via software-based and hardware-based
approaches. Software-based approaches, while easier to implement, are not as
accurate as hardware-based approaches. The process of measuring the energy
consumption of an Android app via a hardware-based approach typically involves
1) setting up a measurement environment, 2) executing the app under test on a
mobile device, 3) recording current/voltage data via a hardware device to
measure energy consumption, and 4) cleaning and aggregating data for analyses,
reports, and visualizations. Specialized scripts are written for selected
hardware and software components to ensure reliable energy measurements. The
energy measurement process is repeated many times and aggregated to remove
noise. These steps make the hardware-based energy measurement process
time-consuming and not easy to adapt or reproduce. There is a lack of
open-source tools available for developers and researchers to take reliable
energy measurements via hardware devices. In this paper, we present and
demonstrate ARENA, a support tool that enables developers and researchers to
connect to a physical measurement device without leaving the comfort of their
IDE. Developers could use ARENA during development to compare energy
consumption between different apps or versions of the same app. ARENA
calculates energy consumption on an Android smartphone by executing a test
scenario on the app under development. Further, ARENA helps aggregate,
statistically analyze, report, and visualize the data, allowing developers and
researchers to dig into the data directly or visually. We implemented ARENA as
an IntelliJ and Android Studio plugin.

### [421] [Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825)
*Zhenyu Yang,Yue Pan,Zhen Yang,Zhongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NARRepair, a non-autoregressive (NAR) model designed to address performance delays in automatic program repair (APR). Compared to traditional autoregressive models, NARRepair achieves faster repair times with competitive patch quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the time delays associated with autoregressive program repair models and explore how non-autoregressive approaches can improve repair speed while maintaining patch quality.

Method: The authors created NARRepair, a non-autoregressive code generation model tailored for APR. Key innovations include a repair action predictor, inter-token dependency extractor, and a two-stage decoder.

Result: NARRepair outperforms prior APR techniques in both speed and accuracy across three datasets. Specifically, it improves repair speeds by 1.4-6.4x in GPU environments while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: NARRepair successfully adapts non-autoregressive methods for APR tasks, offering a balance of high accuracy and significantly improved repair speed compared to autoregressive models.

Abstract: Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various
application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on
automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous
machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the
autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.
Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has
a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large
number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the
non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code
in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the
NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch
quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper
propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR
task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the
repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the
inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking
inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for
alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair
on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that
1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best
performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR
techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times
in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved
state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and
accuracy.

### [422] [RefFilter: Improving Semantic Conflict Detection via Refactoring-Aware Static Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01960)
*Victor Lira,Paulo Borba,Rodrigo Bonifácio,Galileu Santos e Matheus barbosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RefFilter is a tool designed to improve semantic interference detection in software development by addressing false positives caused by behavior-preserving refactorings, achieving nearly 32% reduction in false positives while maintaining overall precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High rates of false positives in semantic interference detection due to behavior-preserving refactorings hinder collaborative software development.

Method: RefFilter integrates refactoring detection into existing static analysis techniques to discard irrelevant behavior-preserving refactorings, improving detection accuracy.

Result: RefFilter reduces false positives by nearly 32% in a labeled dataset of 99 scenarios, with minimal increase in false negatives, showing improved precision and scalability in interference detection.

Conclusion: Refactoring-aware interference detection, as implemented by RefFilter, is a practical way to enhance merge support in software workflows, offering significant precision improvements.

Abstract: Detecting semantic interference remains a challenge in collaborative software
development. Recent lightweight static analysis techniques improve efficiency
over SDG-based methods, but they still suffer from a high rate of false
positives. A key cause of these false positives is the presence of
behavior-preserving code refactorings, which current techniques cannot
effectively distinguish from changes that impact behavior and can interfere
with others. To handle this problem we present RefFilter, a refactoring-aware
tool for semantic interference detection. It builds on existing static
techniques by incorporating automated refactoring detection to improve
precision. RefFilter discards behavior-preserving refactorings from reports,
reducing false positives while preserving detection coverage. To evaluate
effectiveness and scalability, use two datasets: a labeled dataset with 99
scenarios and ground truth, and a novel dataset of 1,087 diverse merge
scenarios that we have built. Experimental results show that RefFilter reduces
false positives by nearly 32% on the labeled dataset. While this reduction
comes with a non significant increase in false negatives, the overall gain in
precision significantly outweighs the minor trade-off in recall. These findings
demonstrate that refactoring-aware interference detection is a practical and
effective strategy for improving merge support in modern development workflows.

### [423] [Clarifying Semantics of In-Context Examples for Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01994)
*Chen Yang,Lin Yang,Ziqi Wang,Dong Wang,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAST, a novel technique to refine unit tests, improving their semantic clarity and in-context learning utility, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of poorly structured or unclear in-context examples on the effectiveness of generated tests by refining the semantic clarity of unit tests.

Method: CLAST combines program analysis with LLM-based rewriting to systematically decompose and refine unclear unit tests.

Result: CLAST outperformed the existing UTgen technique by preserving test effectiveness while improving semantic clarity, with substantial improvements in metrics like CSR, PR, and Cov compared to UTgen.

Conclusion: CLAST significantly enhances the clarity and effectiveness of unit tests, aiding better ICL-based unit test generation and setting a foundation for future research in software testing.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising
performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However,
the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness
of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples
often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel
technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic
clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach
decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic
clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We
evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results
demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art
refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing
semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness
of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate
(PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%,
35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user
study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably,
incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based
unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an
average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for
generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights
from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in
software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.

### [424] [Automatic Generation of Combinatorial Reoptimisation Problem Specifications: A Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02002)
*Maximilian Kratz,Steffen Zschaler,Jens Kosiol,Gabriele Taentzer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses reoptimisation problems, proposing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) as a systematic approach to adapting solutions through declarative modeling and model transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by the need to adapt already-optimized solutions when contextual factors change, minimizing impact while maintaining optimality.

Method: The authors use Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), focusing on declarative modeling languages and model transformations, along with an initial implementation using the GIPS tool to tackle combinatorial reoptimisation problems.

Result: An initial proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach applied to a teaching assistant allocation scenario.

Conclusion: Model-Driven Engineering presents promising opportunities for systematically specifying reoptimisation problems, validated by a practical implementation example.

Abstract: Once an optimisation problem has been solved, the solution may need
adaptation when contextual factors change. This challenge, also known as
reoptimisation, has been addressed in various problem domains, such as railway
crew rescheduling, nurse rerostering, or aircraft recovery. This requires a
modified problem to be solved again to ensure that the adapted solution is
optimal in the new context. However, the new optimisation problem differs
notably from the original problem: (i) we want to make only minimal changes to
the original solution to minimise the impact; (ii) we may be unable to change
some parts of the original solution (e.g., because they refer to past
allocations); and (iii) we need to derive a change script from the original
solution to the new solution. In this paper, we argue that Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) - in particular, the use of declarative modelling languages
and model transformations for the high-level specification of optimisation
problems - offers new opportunities for the systematic derivation of
reoptimisation problems from the original optimisation problem specification.
We focus on combinatorial reoptimisation problems and provide an initial
categorisation of changing problems and strategies for deriving the
corresponding reoptimisation specifications. We introduce an initial
proof-of-concept implementation based on the GIPS (Graph-Based (Mixed) Integer
Linear Programming Problem Specification) tool and apply it to an example
resource-allocation problem: the allocation of teaching assistants to teaching
sessions.

*Justus Bogner,Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new ACM SIGSOFT SEN column to discuss meta-aspects of empirical software engineering (ESE) research and enhance community engagement on challenging or underexplored topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address ongoing challenges in the empirical software engineering (ESE) field, such as reproducibility, external validity, and the lack of explicit documentation for newcomers.

Method: The column will serve as a venue for discussions based on expert interviews, focus groups, surveys, and position papers, covering diverse ESE meta-aspects like best practices and interdisciplinary methods.

Result: A specialized column (SEN-ESE) is established to encourage reflection, discourse, and improvements in ESE research and its methodologies.

Conclusion: By creating this regular discussion platform, the authors aim to advance the ESE field and build a community-driven space for research refinement and exploration of overlooked topics.

Abstract: From its early foundations in the 1970s, empirical software engineering (ESE)
has evolved into a mature research discipline that embraces a plethora of
different topics, methodologies, and industrial practices. Despite its
remarkable progress, the ESE research field still needs to keep evolving, as
new impediments, shortcoming, and technologies emerge. Research
reproducibility, limited external validity, subjectivity of reviews, and
porting research results to industrial practices are just some examples of the
drivers for improvements to ESE research. Additionally, several facets of ESE
research are not documented very explicitly, which makes it difficult for
newcomers to pick them up. With this new regular ACM SIGSOFT SEN column
(SEN-ESE), we introduce a venue for discussing meta-aspects of ESE research,
ranging from general topics such as the nature and best practices for
replication packages, to more nuanced themes such as statistical methods,
interview transcription tools, and publishing interdisciplinary research. Our
aim for the column is to be a place where we can regularly spark conversations
on ESE topics that might not often be touched upon or are left implicit.
Contributions to this column will be grounded in expert interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and position pieces, with the goal of encouraging reflection
and improvement in how we conduct, communicate, teach, and ultimately improve
ESE research. Finally, we invite feedback from the ESE community on
challenging, controversial, or underexplored topics, as well as suggestions for
voices you would like to hear from. While we cannot promise to act on every
idea, we aim to shape this column around the community interests and are
grateful for all contributions.

*Peter Wauyo,Dalia Bwiza,Alain Murara,Edwin Mugume,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal AI system combining video and audio data to detect fare evasion and fraud in public transportation, achieving 89.5% accuracy and outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the financial and operational challenges posed by fare evasion and fraudulent activities in public transportation systems.

Method: The authors use the Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT) for visual data and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. They integrate these modalities using a Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) for advanced cross-modal interactions.

Result: The system achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent activities, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. The tensor fusion method improved results significantly compared to traditional techniques.

Conclusion: The solution offers a real-time, high-performing fraud detection system that can improve revenue, ensure passenger safety, and optimize public transport operations.

Abstract: This research introduces a multimodal system designed to detect fraud and
fare evasion in public transportation by analyzing closed circuit television
(CCTV) and audio data. The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for
Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram
Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion
Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal
interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique
captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g.,
tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds).
The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of
89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent
activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding
the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation
fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor
fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost
in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports
real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue
loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.

*Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji,El-hacen Diallo,Jordan Samhi,Kui Liu,Jacques Klein,Tegawendé F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIEVE, a framework addressing quality assurance challenges in public code datasets by introducing machine-readable statistical certifications instead of static dataset cards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of quality guarantees and auditable systems in public code datasets poses challenges for empirical software engineering and code agent reliability.

Method: The paper proposes SIEVE, a framework that converts quality checks into Confidence Cards, which are statistical, machine-readable, and verifiable certificates for dataset properties.

Result: The approach aims to provide anytime-valid statistical bounds to replace narrative dataset cards, allowing for community-driven, auditable quality assurance.

Conclusion: SIEVE is expected to reduce costs of quality assurance pipelines and enhance trust in code datasets through verifiable statistical certification methods.

Abstract: Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets,
yet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards'
inform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical
guarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build
isolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We
present SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into
Confidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid
statistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity,
replacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is
expected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM), a framework designed to enhance transparency and trust in AI systems beyond standard Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and unique challenges posed by AI-driven technologies in the software supply chain, such as dynamic dependencies and fragmented governance, which are inadequately handled by existing SBOM frameworks.

Method: The authors propose TAIBOM, a framework with a structured dependency model, integrity propagation mechanisms, and trust attestation processes specifically tailored for the AI domain.

Result: TAIBOM enables assurance, security, and compliance in AI workflows, outperforming existing standards like SPDX and CycloneDX.

Conclusion: The framework lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through enhanced software transparency tailored to AI's unique characteristics.

Abstract: The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies
has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain,
challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance.
While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing
transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the
unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven
nature and the loosely coupled dependencies across datasets, models, and
software components. These challenges are compounded by fragmented governance
structures and the lack of robust tools for ensuring integrity, trust, and
compliance in AI-enabled environments.
  In this paper, we introduce Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) -- a novel
framework extending SBOM principles to the AI domain. TAIBOM provides (i) a
structured dependency model tailored for AI components, (ii) mechanisms for
propagating integrity statements across heterogeneous AI pipelines, and (iii) a
trust attestation process for verifying component provenance. We demonstrate
how TAIBOM supports assurance, security, and compliance across AI workflows,
highlighting its advantages over existing standards such as SPDX and CycloneDX.
This work lays the foundation for trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through
structured software transparency.

*Paschal C. Amusuo,Dongge Liu,Ricardo Andres Calvo Mendez,Jonathan Metzman,Oliver Chang,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces two AI-driven strategies to mitigate false positives in automated fuzz driver generation systems like OSS-Fuzz-Gen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False positive crashes in automatically generated fuzz drivers erode trust in the system and complicate industry-scale fuzzing efforts.

Method: The researchers develop two approaches: constraint-based fuzz driver generation to enforce input constraints, and context-based crash validation to analyze crash feasibility.

Result: Applying these methods reduced false positive crashes by up to 8% and halved the reported crashes, demonstrating the effectiveness of cutting-edge LLMs for program analysis.

Conclusion: AI-driven strategies are effective in reducing false positives in fuzz driver generation, enhancing the credibility and efficiency of large-scale fuzzing frameworks.

Abstract: Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs
and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and
open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,
which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target
function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz
drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models
to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers
frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly
structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially
crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as
reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system
and the team.
  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in
OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,
constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a
function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based
crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether
reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark
functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes
by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that
frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results
highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing
pipelines.

*Stefania Kaklamani,Constantinos Simserides*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines how frequency ratio and mean frequency affect listeners' preference for dyads made of sine tones, finding that higher frequencies reduce preference and musicians show greater positive bias towards certain intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how factors like frequency ratio ($R$) and mean frequency ($F$) influence perceptions of consonance and dissonance in dyadic tones across different listener demographics.

Method: Participants rated randomly ordered dyads (made of sine tones based on standard Western interval ratios) using binary preference responses. The study analyzed effects across musical training, gender, and age groups.

Result: Preference for dyads declined with increasing mean frequency ($F$) across all groups. Musicians favored consonant intervals more than non-musicians. Sensitivity to high frequencies showed gender and age-related variation.

Conclusion: Interval structure and pitch range significantly impact consonance perception in sine-tone dyads, likely due to psychoacoustic effects like frequency sensitivity and auditory fatigue at higher frequencies.

Abstract: This study investigates how listeners perceive consonance and dissonance in
dyads composed of simple (sine) tones, focusing on the effects of frequency
ratio ($R$) and mean frequency ($F$). Seventy adult participants - categorized
by musical training, gender, and age group - rated randomly ordered dyads using
binary preference responses (``like'' or ``dislike''). Dyads represented
standard Western intervals but were constructed with sine tones rather than
musical notes, preserving interval ratios while varying absolute pitch.
Statistical analyses reveal a consistent decrease in preference with increasing
mean frequency, regardless of interval class or participant group. Octaves,
fifths, fourths, and sixths showed a nearly linear decline in preference with
increasing $F$. Major seconds were among the least preferred. Musicians rated
octaves and certain consonant intervals more positively than non-musicians,
while gender and age groups exhibited different sensitivity to high
frequencies. The findings suggest that both interval structure and pitch range
shape the perception of consonance in simple-tone dyads, with possible
psychoacoustic explanations involving frequency sensitivity and auditory
fatigue at higher frequencies.

*Lindsey Knowles,Cesar Ceballos,Rodrigo Pena*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This work develops simplified models to describe two modes of neuron operation: coincidence detection and integration, which may explain neural coding processes and related disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neurons process information through electrical currents is essential for decoding the mechanisms of neuronal functioning, addressing coding properties, and investigating dysfunctions.

Method: Two simplified models, a polynomial model with non-linear coefficients, were derived to explain neuronal modes—coincidence detection and integration—under in vivo stimulation.

Result: The study reveals that small nonlinear coefficients in the polynomial model are pivotal for mode transitions, offering insights into underlying neuronal processes.

Conclusion: Defining neuronal operational modes helps elucidate information transmission in neurons and may provide valuable understanding of electrophysiological dysfunction causing disorders like channelopathies.

Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes
that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to
elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving in vivo stimulation, we
show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the
coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a
simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients betam that captures
the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can
explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear
coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes
provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through
electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal
functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological
behavior, such as channelopathies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether modern video and language models encode human-like perception in social videos and address any inadequacy.

Method: The study uses over 49,000 human similarity judgments on 250 video clips, fine-tunes a TimeSformer model with hybrid triplet-RSA objectives and LoRA, and assesses alignment with human perception.

Result: Fine-tuned video models improved alignment with human similarity, enhanced encoding of social-affective attributes, and explained unique variance beyond language embeddings.

Conclusion: Behavior-guided fine-tuning refines video models to better capture human social perception, bridging gaps in pretrained video models' social recognition.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it
remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity
structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture
human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this
structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we
introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on
250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality
gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align
better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap
by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our
novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning
pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields
significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in
terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance
partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance
with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured
by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find
that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective
attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the
pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video
models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning
shapes video representations toward human social perception.

*Sangjoon J. Kim,Vicky Chan,Niko Fullmer,Emily R. Rosario,Christine Kim,Charles Y. Liu,Marti Comellas,Daniel K. Zondervan,David J. Reinkensmeyer,An H. Do*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study evaluated Boost, a wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device, in stroke recovery patients, finding its feasibility and potential short-term benefits, especially for mild impairments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke often leads to chronic upper extremity impairments, making effective rehabilitation devices and methods crucial for motor recovery.

Method: 35 stroke inpatients were randomized to use either Boost or a therapist-customized booklet for additional upper extremity exercises alongside standard therapy. Multiple measures assessed outcomes.

Result: Participants using Boost completed thousands of additional arm movements. Immediately post-intervention, Boost users showed a trend towards greater improvement, significantly benefiting patients with mild impairments.

Conclusion: Boost-assisted therapy shows promise in enhancing therapy outcomes during subacute rehabilitation, especially for mild impairments, but larger trials are needed to validate its long-term benefits and optimal dosage.

Abstract: Chronic upper extremity (UE) impairment is common after stroke. This study
evaluated Boost, a novel wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device designed to
assist individuals in UE motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation.
Thirty-five stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional UE
exercises alongside standard therapy, using either Boost or a
therapist-customized booklet for self-practice. Outcomes included the UE
Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) Exam, Box and Block Test, Motor Activity Log, Modified
Ashworth Scale, shoulder subluxation, and shoulder pain. At baseline, mean days
post-stroke were 11.9$\pm$4.6 and 13.1$\pm$5.9, and UEFM scores were
20.5$\pm$10.1 and 21.0$\pm$13.5. Intervention durations averaged 11.9$\pm$4.0
and 17.2$\pm$8.8 days, respectively. Participants in the Boost group completed
3,359$\pm$3,137 additional arm movements. No significant between-group
differences were found at the three-month follow-up. However, the Boost group
showed a trend toward greater UEFM improvement immediately post-intervention
(11.8 vs. 6.9 points, p=0.06). Importantly, UEFM gains were predicted by the
number of Boost exercises performed (p=0.02, R-square=0.34). Subgroup analysis
revealed that patients with less severe impairment (baseline UEFM >21) achieved
significantly greater UEFM improvements at discharge with Boost compared to
controls (15.8 vs. 7.8 points, p=0.01). These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of achieving thousands of additional UE practice movements while
seated in a wheelchair without direct supervision during subacute
rehabilitation. The added movement practice was well tolerated and may offer
short-term impairment-reduction benefits, particularly in those with less
severe impairment. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy, establish
optimal dosage, and determine long-term clinical and functional benefits of
Boost-assisted therapy.

### [434] [A Modular Theory of Subjective Consciousness for Natural and Artificial Minds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01864)
*Michaël Gillon*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a computational framework for understanding consciousness as a sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs), introducing a density-tagging mechanism to quantify subjective intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of understanding how subjective experiences emerge from information processing, a key question in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI.

Method: MCT describes consciousness as discrete Integrated Informational States that are integrated from environmental and bodily inputs. These states are processed through specialized modules, tagged with a multidimensional density vector, and influence memory, behavior, and decision-making.

Result: The framework introduces a quantifiable, biologically-grounded model that ties subjective intensity to measurable parameters, allowing for testable predictions like stress enhancing memory.

Conclusion: MCT presents consciousness as a functional and constructible feature of complex systems, providing insights that bridge neuroscience and AI while suggesting testable and applicable models.

Abstract: Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing
remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI
research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically
grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a
discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a
packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector
that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with
subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience.
Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules
(abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an
IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to
behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop.
This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term
memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information
Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline
producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure.
Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with
functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress
enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both
biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an
irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature
of complex information processing.

*Yule Wang,Joseph Yu,Chengrui Li,Weihan Li,Anqi Wu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIG-Vis, a method that uses diffusion models to visualize and validate the semantic attributes in neural latent subspaces of higher visual cortex areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior research has correlated artificial neural networks with the visual cortex, data on the internal structure and semantic organization of neural populations remains insufficient.

Method: The paper uses a variational autoencoder to disentangle neural latent subspaces and applies mutual information-guided diffusion synthesis to extract visual-semantic features.

Result: MIG-Vis successfully identified neural groups with semantic selectivity for features like object pose, transformations, and intra-class content using spiking data from macaques' inferior temporal cortex.

Conclusion: The findings provide interpretable evidence of semantically organized neural populations, contributing to understanding higher visual cortex encoding principles.

Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode
object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational
neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between
artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings
are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations
themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features
from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.
This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual
information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,
and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful
subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages
the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the
visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first
uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent
subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information
(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific
visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on
multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of
two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies
neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual
features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and
intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of
structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our
understanding of its encoding principles.

### [436] [Private Realizable-to-Agnostic Transformation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01291)
*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves upon the realizable-to-agnostic transformation in private learning, achieving near-optimal sample complexity for agnostic learning without dependence on the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for converting private realizable learners to private agnostic learners introduce suboptimal additional sample complexity due to a $1/\varepsilon$ factor when $\varepsilon$ is not constant.

Method: The authors propose a new construction that eliminates the $1/\varepsilon$ dependency, relying on techniques that improve sample complexity while addressing the privacy implications.

Result: The new approach achieves sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon \leq 1$, an improvement over previous methods. It also provides nearly tight bounds for the private prediction problem.

Conclusion: This work refines the understanding of sample complexity in private agnostic learning and resolves an open problem regarding private prediction, highlighting that privacy's primary cost appears in the realizable setting.

Abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et al.,
2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the
realizable setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the
concept class) to a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no
assumptions are imposed on the data). Specifically, for any concept class
$\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$, a private realizable learner for
$\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only
increasing the sample complexity by
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight
assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. However, when
$\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard
privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011),
resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$ that involves a
$1/\varepsilon$ factor.
  In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence
on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon\le 1$.
Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy
cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our
technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private
prediction problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman
(2018) and Dagan and Feldman (2020).

*Huangjie Zheng,Shansan Gong,Ruixiang Zhang,Tianrong Chen,Jiatao Gu,Mingyuan Zhou,Navdeep Jaitly,Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CADD introduces a framework combining discrete diffusion with continuous latent spaces to improve generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discrete diffusion models lose semantic information during denoising due to collapsing unobserved states into an 'information void.'

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach that pairs discrete diffusion with continuous latent space, where masked tokens are replaced by informative noisy latent vectors instead of an absorbing state.

Result: CADD improves generative quality in text, images, and code modeling compared to existing discrete diffusion methods, showing both qualitative and quantitative gains.

Conclusion: CADD effectively enhances the balance between generating diverse and precise outputs, providing a meaningful advancement over traditional discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by
mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void'
where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost
between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion
(CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired
diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted
states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent
vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD
may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete
denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion
training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the
continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage
(generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise
outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative
quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and
code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative
metrics against strong discrete baselines.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies how varying spike strengths and alignments with spikes impact generalization errors in linear regression, identifying regimes of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting and providing exact expressions for risks in overparameterized settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors influencing generalization errors, especially in overparameterized linear regression models using spiked covariance data.

Method: The study employs exact expressions for generalization error in spiked covariance models, examining how spike strength, aspect ratio, and target-spike alignment interplay to classify overfitting behaviors.

Result: The paper identifies conditions under which spike strength and target-spike alignment lead to different generalization error behaviors, emphasizing the possibility of catastrophic overfitting induced by large spike strength even in aligned problems.

Conclusion: The findings challenge traditional views on spike alignment advantages and provide insights into conditions under which alignment hurts model performance, with implications for both linear and nonlinear settings.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the generalization error of minimum-norm interpolating
solutions in linear regression using spiked covariance data models. The paper
characterizes how varying spike strengths and target-spike alignments can
affect risk, especially in overparameterized settings. The study presents an
exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive
classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based
on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \to \infty$),
and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing
spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before
achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike
alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes
counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment. Alignment with the
spike being detrimental is empirically demonstrated to persist in nonlinear
models.

*Lang Tong,Xinyi Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time Series GPT (TS-GPT), a foundation AI model tailored for time series in engineering applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering time series are governed by physical laws rather than linguistic rules, making language-model-based AI systems inefficient for such tasks.

Method: The authors developed TS-GPT, built on innovations representation theory, to model time series data and applied it to probabilistic generative forecasting tasks.

Result: TS-GPT demonstrated strong performance in forecasting locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that specialized, innovations-based models can outperform general-purpose language models in engineering time series applications, particularly for tasks requiring real-time processing and control.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for
time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required
for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are
governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based
AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the
classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and
Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an
innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for
engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model
adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces
future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given
past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting
real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S.
independent system operators.

*Raphaël Carpintero Perez,Sébastien Da Veiga,Josselin Garnier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper conducts a reproducible comparative study of categorical kernels for Gaussian Process regression, introduces new evaluation metrics, and proposes a clustering strategy for cases with unknown group structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a comprehensive comparison of categorical kernels due to a lack of consistent evaluation metrics, optimization procedures, datasets, and reproducible code in previous studies.

Method: The study evaluates existing categorical kernels on multiple datasets, introduces new optimization-inspired metrics, and proposes a clustering method based on target encodings for cases with unknown group structures.

Result: Nested kernel methods are effective when dataset group structures are known. For unknown structures, the proposed clustering-based strategy surpasses other methods and balances efficiency with performance.

Conclusion: The paper identifies strong methods for categorical kernels under varying conditions and provides tools to further research with an emphasis on reproducibility and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process
regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it
is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation
metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the
study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this
paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing
categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also
propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which
provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our
results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of
categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform
all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior
knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using
target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of
datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this
estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low
computational cost.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes using an AlphaZero-based system for replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets, demonstrating its advantages over deep hedging in non-convex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in replication portfolio construction used in financial applications, highlighting limitations of traditional deep hedging methods in complex market environments.

Method: An AlphaZero-based system is introduced to model portfolio construction as a two-player game between the investor and market, and its performance is compared to deep hedging methods.

Result: AlphaZero demonstrated superior performance in finding near-optimal strategies, particularly in non-convex transactional and regulatory settings, and proved more sample-efficient.

Conclusion: AlphaZero offers a robust alternative to deep hedging by overcoming its convexity constraints, making it more effective in challenging and data-scarce financial environments.

Abstract: This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets
- a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging,
balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a
two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes
strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by
the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an
AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely
used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis
and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the
$Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving
non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations -
converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to
highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds
near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a
connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its
effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further
suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in
data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on analyzing gradient flow dynamics of Diagonal Linear Networks (DLNs) using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), providing insights into various training phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLNs exhibit complex training behaviors, but the overall dynamics are not well understood as existing studies address individual phenomena in isolation.

Method: DMFT is used to derive a simplified, low-dimensional process that captures gradient flow dynamics of DLNs in high dimensions.

Result: The derived effective process explains loss convergence rates, their trade-offs with generalization, and reproduces several known phenomena in DLN training.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of DLN dynamics and showcases the utility of DMFT in examining high-dimensional learning processes of neural networks.

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several
nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as
initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena
are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently
understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in
the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT),
we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic
gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process
yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and
their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the
previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing
high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous-time approach to persistent contrastive divergence for training energy-based models, introducing explicit error bounds and an implementation based on a stable integration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for accurate and stable optimization techniques for unnormalised density maximum likelihood estimation in energy-based models.

Method: Formulated the optimization as a coupled system of stochastic differential equations, derived error bounds, and implemented the scheme using stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK) integrators.

Result: Derived explicit error bounds for PCD iterates, achieved uniform-in-time performance, and designed a novel continuous-time scheme for energy-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves training stability and accuracy for EBMs, offering explicit error guarantees and efficient implementation in the long-time regime.

Abstract: We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence
(PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our
approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and
sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously.
  From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the
error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter.
This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the
difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An
efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced,
leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal
Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates
in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based
models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.

*Moritz Melcher,Simon Weissmann,Ashia C. Wilson,Jakob Zech*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method for dynamically adjusting kernel parameters in Bayesian posterior approximations, improving accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently approximating posterior distributions through Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), which is sensitive to kernel function choices.

Method: Adaptive SVGD alternates between updating particles using SVGD and dynamically tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD).

Result: Adaptive SVGD outperformed standard kernel selection methods across various tasks, showcasing improved approximation and convergence.

Conclusion: By adaptively optimizing kernel parameters, Adaptive SVGD demonstrates better performance and reinforces theoretical guarantees for convergence in Bayesian inference.

Abstract: A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating
posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular
variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate
a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel
function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality.
The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel
bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in
high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for
adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels.
Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD)
suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a
method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively
tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a
simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the
KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties
for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further
support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in
a variety of tasks.

*Lucas Morisset,Adrien Hardy,Alain Durmus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies high-dimensional inverse covariance estimation using two methods: linear shrinkage and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising demand for precision matrix estimation in high dimensions requires robust and analyzable methods.

Method: Develops estimators for two methodologies, derives concentration bounds, and uses random matrix theory for theoretical analysis.

Result: Proposes new estimators, provides theoretical bounds for error, and supports findings with numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques allow for comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and yield insights applicable to precision matrix modeling in high dimensions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as
precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we
focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target
proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data
augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a
dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or
through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting.
For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration
bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and
hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial
samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix
theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent
matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support
our theoretical results with numerical experiments.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework using physics and machine learning to address Arctic infrastructure risk caused by permafrost decline, enabling spatiotemporal forecasting with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks are inadequate in assessing Arctic infrastructure risk due to lacking spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and decision-support capabilities.

Method: The paper integrates machine learning with physics-based models using 2.9M observations, a hybrid ensemble method, rigorous cross-validation, and extrapolative climate-permafrost sensitivity modeling.

Result: Achieved high prediction accuracy (R2=0.980, RMSE=5.01 pp); under drastic warming scenarios, forecast significant permafrost loss and infrastructure risk classification across Arctic Russia.

Conclusion: The framework provides validated forecasting tools for operational Arctic infrastructure planning and generalizable approaches to address machine learning limitations in climate applications.

Abstract: Arctic warming threatens over 100 billion in permafrost-dependent
infrastructure across Northern territories, yet existing risk assessment
frameworks lack spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and
operational decision-support capabilities. We present a hybrid physics-machine
learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations
(2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our
stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic
Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal
cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning
limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach
combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical
permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over
10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median:
-20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point

delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity to design a robust control system capable of handling disturbances while ensuring precise trajectory tracking in complex drone payload transport scenarios.

Method: Utilizing a control contraction metric (CCM) for a baseline neural controller and integrating an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) for disturbance compensation.

Result: The modular framework achieved zero trajectory tracking error under certain disturbances and demonstrated stability in simulations with complex trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed control design was effective in robust trajectory tracking under disturbances, showcasing modularity, stability, and robustness in simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung
payload transportation system to track a reference path under external
disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural
exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input
saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance
estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent
disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the
controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero
trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The
stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM
controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated
trajectories under external disturbances.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust and scalable cooperative guidance framework for aerial defense, guaranteeing the interception of a hostile drone by a defender drone before it captures an evader drone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical challenge of autonomous aerial defense in contested airspace, requiring reliable interception strategies under dynamic and uncertain conditions.

Method: It introduces a time-constrained guidance framework based on true proportional navigation, offering computational efficiency and guaranteed interception without relying on the pursuer's strategy or control laws.

Result: Extensive simulations confirm the strategy's ability to ensure interception in diverse, adversarial scenarios starting from arbitrary initial conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, scalable, robust, and applicable in real-time autonomous defense situations, ensuring successful mission completion regardless of initial geometries or engagement uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested
airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the
pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the
defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender
team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the
evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike
traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we
approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging
true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed
solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is
computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent
configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or
control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key
engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a
successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial
scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance
for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper compares Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for HVAC systems in a real-world residential setting, evaluating their energy-saving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability and practical application challenges of advanced HVAC control strategies by comparing MPC and RL, particularly focusing on RL's potential for greater automation and adaptability.

Method: The authors performed a one-month-long, real-world empirical comparison of MPC and a model-based RL controller in an occupied house with a heat pump system. They assessed energy savings, scalability, and occupant comfort while ensuring operational safety.

Result: The study found that RL achieved 22% energy savings, slightly exceeding MPC's 20%. However, when normalized for comfort, MPC outperformed RL. RL demonstrated reduced engineering overhead but faced practical trade-offs in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: RL shows promise for automation but currently faces challenges such as safety, initialization, and maintaining learning integrity. The paper identifies critical research directions to make RL a scalable HVAC control solution.

Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer
significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial
engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises
greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in
real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing
challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To
investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC
and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month
period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana.
This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC
implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced
controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing
controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the
existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with
modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were
normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior
performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces
engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and
operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of
safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions
and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online
learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research
directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable
HVAC control solution.

### [450] [DiffKnock: Diffusion-based Knockoff Statistics for Neural Networks Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01418)
*Heng Ge,Qing Lu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: DiffKnock is a new framework for feature selection that leverages diffusion models for reliable high-dimensional data analysis, ensuring finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knockoff methods struggle to preserve complex feature dependencies and detect non-linear associations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed DiffKnock framework employs diffusion models to generate valid knockoffs and uses gradient and filter statistics from neural networks to evaluate feature importance asymmetrically.

Result: DiffKnock outperformed autoencoder-based knockoff methods in simulations by achieving greater statistical power while maintaining FDR control. The approach successfully identified important genes and regulators in single-cell RNA-seq data.

Conclusion: DiffKnock combines deep generative models with statistical rigor for effective feature selection in high-dimensional data and is a particularly powerful tool for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

Abstract: We introduce DiffKnock, a diffusion-based knockoff framework for
high-dimensional feature selection with finite-sample false discovery rate
(FDR) control. DiffKnock addresses two key limitations of existing knockoff
methods: preserving complex feature dependencies and detecting non-linear
associations. Our approach trains diffusion models to generate valid knockoffs
and uses neural network--based gradient and filter statistics to construct
antisymmetric feature importance measures. Through simulations, we showed that
DiffKnock achieved higher power than autoencoder-based knockoffs while
maintaining target FDR, indicating its superior performance in scenarios
involving complex non-linear architectures. Applied to murine single-cell
RNA-seq data of LPS-stimulated macrophages, DiffKnock identifies canonical
NF-$\kappa$B target genes (Ccl3, Hmox1) and regulators (Fosb, Pdgfb). These
results highlight that, by combining the flexibility of deep generative models
with rigorous statistical guarantees, DiffKnock is a powerful and reliable tool
for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, as well as high-dimensional and
structured data in other domains.

*Jianwei Shi,Sameh Abdulah,Ying Sun,Marc G. Genton*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A framework for asynchronous federated spatial modeling is introduced with low-rank Gaussian process approximations, addressing privacy, performance, and scalability issues in distributed applications like environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and communication constraints in federated spatial data modeling, particularly for applications such as environmental monitoring where centralized data sharing is not feasible.

Method: The paper proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework using low-rank Gaussian process approximations, block-wise optimization, and strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates.

Result: Linear convergence of the framework is established, and experimental results show that the asynchronous algorithm matches synchronous performance in balanced cases and outperforms it in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The asynchronous federated modeling approach ensures robust and scalable spatial data modeling while preserving privacy and addressing the challenges of heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and
urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and
communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a
practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling
across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks
are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling
that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely,
high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing
federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on
synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments.
This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial
data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs
block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction,
adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence
with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical
significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous
algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation
and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior
robustness and scalability.

*Yann McLatchie,Badr-Eddine Cherief-Abdellatif,David T. Frazier,Jeremias Knoblauch*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new statistical approach called the predictively oriented (PrO) posterior to enhance predictive inference and density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical and generalized Bayes posteriors in scenarios involving model misspecification.

Method: The PrO posterior expresses uncertainty relative to predictive ability and adapts to model misspecification, concentrating only when the model can capture the data-generating process.

Result: Up to logarithmic factors, PrO posteriors converge to predictively optimal outcomes at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$ and provide an interpretable measure of model misspecification.

Conclusion: The PrO posterior offers significant advantages over existing methods by effectively handling model misspecification, and its practical usefulness is demonstrated through numerical examples.

Abstract: We advocate for a new statistical principle that combines the most desirable
aspects of both parameter inference and density estimation. This leads us to
the predictively oriented (PrO) posterior, which expresses uncertainty as a
consequence of predictive ability. Doing so leads to inferences which
predictively dominate both classical and generalised Bayes posterior predictive
distributions: up to logarithmic factors, PrO posteriors converge to the
predictively optimal model average at rate $n^{-1/2}$. Whereas classical and
generalised Bayes posteriors only achieve this rate if the model can recover
the data-generating process, PrO posteriors adapt to the level of model
misspecification. This means that they concentrate around the true model at
rate $n^{1/2}$ in the same way as Bayes and Gibbs posteriors if the model can
recover the data-generating distribution, but do \textit{not} concentrate in
the presence of non-trivial forms of model misspecification. Instead, they
stabilise towards a predictively optimal posterior whose degree of irreducible
uncertainty admits an interpretation as the degree of model misspecification --
a sharp contrast to how Bayesian uncertainty and its existing extensions
behave. Lastly, we show that PrO posteriors can be sampled from by evolving
particles based on mean field Langevin dynamics, and verify the practical
significance of our theoretical developments on a number of numerical examples.

TL;DR: JaneEye proposes an efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator for XR wearables using ultra-lightweight neural networks and custom hardware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frame-based eye-tracking systems fail to meet XR's high demands for accuracy, latency, and power efficiency. Event cameras offer a promising solution due to their ultra-high temporal resolution and energy efficiency.

Method: JaneEye introduces an energy-efficient hardware accelerator equipped with a lightweight neural network featuring a simplified ConvJANET layer, linear approximations for activation functions, and fixed-point quantization, paired with a 12-nm ASIC implementation.

Result: The system achieved high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45, processing 1250 Hz event frame rates, and demonstrated an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms at 18.9 µJ/frame energy efficiency.

Conclusion: JaneEye significantly improves eye-tracking hardware for XR wearables by setting a benchmark for low power, high performance, and ultra-efficient hardware integration.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

*Ying-Ren Chien,Po-Heng Chou,You-Jie Peng,Chun-Yuan Huang,Hen-Wai Tsao,Yu Tsao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model called NGGAN, designed to generate noise samples for narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. The NGGAN model is trained on practically measured noise data, demonstrating improved quality in noise generation compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mathematical noise models capture only partial characteristics of additive noise, which results in limitations for NB-PLC transceivers. The authors aim to enhance noise processing capabilities by creating a model that learns and generates comprehensive noise statistics based on real measurements.

Method: The authors propose NGGAN, a GAN-based model that learns from practically measured NB-PLC noise. Key approaches include setting an input signal length tailored for cyclo-stationary noise generation, using Wasserstein distance for the loss function, and conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses based on mathematical and measured datasets.

Result: Simulation results indicate that NGGAN surpasses traditional mathematical noise models, like a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM) and frequency-shift (FRESH) filters, in matching the characteristics of noise measured in actual NB-PLC systems.

Conclusion: The NGGAN model effectively captures the complex characteristics of NB-PLC noise, offering enhanced data augmentation capabilities and improving the feasibility of studying and processing impulse noise in such systems.

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

*Jinshuo Zhang,Yafei Wang,Xinping Yi,Wenjin Wang,Shi Jin,Symeon Chatzinotas,Björn Ottersten*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a computationally efficient deep learning framework for symbol-level precoding (SLP) that leverages tensor equivariance to achieve substantial performance gains and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity of optimal constructive interference-based symbol-level precoding (SLP).

Method: The authors propose a deep learning framework that integrates tensor equivariance and attention-based modules to map input data to solutions efficiently. The framework accounts for known closed-form solutions and their relationship to linear precoding.

Result: The framework achieves linear computational complexity, adaptability to imperfect CSI scenarios, and provides an 80x speedup over traditional methods while maintaining strong generalization across varying user numbers and symbol lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and efficient way to leverage the performance benefits of optimal SLP without its computational challenges.

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

TL;DR: This paper introduces M-posteriors as a Bayesian counterpart to M-estimators, showing their theoretical properties and robustness in statistical modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theoretical framework connecting robust M-estimation practices from frequentist statistics with Bayesian approaches by exploring a new class of posteriors: M-posteriors.

Method: The authors develop the M-posterior concept, analyze its asymptotic properties (normality, consistency, robustness), and propose new definitions like posterior influence function and posterior breakdown point.

Result: M-posteriors are shown to contract around M-estimators with robustness under certain conditions, and their theoretical properties are validated through numerical examples.

Conclusion: M-posteriors provide a robust, theoretically sound extension of Bayesian posteriors that link frequentist and Bayesian approaches, suitable for various statistical applications.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework for a wide class of generalized posteriors
that can be viewed as the natural Bayesian posterior counterpart of the class
of M-estimators in the frequentist world. We call the members of this class
M-posteriors and show that they are asymptotically normally distributed under
mild conditions on the M-estimation loss and the prior. In particular, an
M-posterior contracts in probability around a normal distribution centered at
an M-estimator, showing frequentist consistency and suggesting some degree of
robustness depending on the reference M-estimator. We formalize the robustness
properties of the M-posteriors by a new characterization of the posterior
influence function and a novel definition of breakdown point adapted for
posterior distributions. We illustrate the wide applicability of our theory in
various popular models and illustrate their empirical relevance in some
numerical examples.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid predictive model to forecast malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia's Amhara Region, showing better accuracy compared to single-method approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, has complex transmission patterns that make prevention and intervention difficult. Accurate outbreak forecasting is crucial for proper resource allocation and timely interventions.

Method: A hybrid predictive modeling framework combining time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression. The framework utilizes environmental variables, past malaria data, and demographic information from regional health centers.

Result: The proposed model outperformed single-method approaches, offering higher prediction accuracy and exposing hidden patterns in malaria transmission.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective framework for predicting malaria incidence, assisting public health authorities in evidence-based decision-making, resource optimization, and targeted interventions.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in
the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make
prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is
essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This
study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series
forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based
prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past
malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health
centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression
approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including
Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations,
whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations
among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than
single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable
information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and
repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support
evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource
optimization in endemic areas.

*Lokesh Antony Kadiyala,Amir Mirzaeinia*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This study integrates sentiment analysis from ten large language models (LLMs) with intraday stock price data to improve minute-level stock prediction accuracy using two advanced models, Mamba and Reformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stock market's volatile and non-linear nature makes short-term prediction challenging, prompting research into novel enhancements to improve accuracy.

Method: A time-aligned dataset combining AAPL news sentiment scores from ten LLMs and technical indicators was used. Mamba and Reformer models were optimized and trained on this data for minute-level predictions.

Result: Mamba outperformed Reformer in prediction accuracy across all tested LLMs. The best performance came from Mamba using LLaMA 3.3--70B, achieving a low mean squared error of 0.137.

Conclusion: Integrating sentiment analysis from LLMs with temporal modeling approaches like Mamba significantly enhances real-time financial predictive capabilities.

Abstract: The stock market is extremely difficult to predict in the short term due to
high market volatility, changes caused by news, and the non-linear nature of
the financial time series. This research proposes a novel framework for
improving minute-level prediction accuracy using semantic sentiment scores from
top ten different large language models (LLMs) combined with minute interval
intraday stock price data. We systematically constructed a time-aligned dataset
of AAPL news articles and 1-minute Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices for the dates
of April 4 to May 2, 2025. The sentiment analysis was achieved using the
DeepSeek-V3, GPT variants, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and Mistral models
through their APIs. Each article obtained sentiment scores from all ten LLMs,
which were scaled to a [0, 1] range and combined with prices and technical
indicators like RSI, ROC, and Bollinger Band Width. Two state-of-the-art such
as Reformer and Mamba were trained separately on the dataset using the
sentiment scores produced by each LLM as input. Hyper parameters were optimized
by means of Optuna and were evaluated through a 3-day evaluation period.
Reformer had mean squared error (MSE) or the evaluation metrics, and it should
be noted that Mamba performed not only faster but also better than Reformer for
every LLM across the 10 LLMs tested. Mamba performed best with LLaMA 3.3--70B,
with the lowest error of 0.137. While Reformer could capture broader trends
within the data, the model appeared to over smooth sudden changes by the LLMs.
This study highlights the potential of integrating LLM-based semantic analysis
paired with efficient temporal modeling to enhance real-time financial
forecasting.

*Gerson Personnat,Tao Lin,Safwan Hossain,David C. Parkes*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper tackles an online learning problem in multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg games where a leader minimizes regret against followers with private types sampled from an unknown distribution. Different feedback settings are considered, with efficient algorithms developed for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing strategies in multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg games, where the leader must adaptively learn to minimize regret without prior knowledge of the followers' type distribution.

Method: Algorithms were developed for two feedback settings: (1) Type feedback, where the followers' private types are observable to the leader, and (2) Action feedback, where only followers' actions are observable. Theoretical bounds on regret were derived for both cases.

Result: Under type feedback, regret bounds achieved are \(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK \} \cdot T})\) for independent distributions and \(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T})\) for general distributions. For action feedback, regret bounds are \(\mathcal{O}( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T \log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )\). A lower bound of \(\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})\) was also established.

Conclusion: The study presents near-optimal learning algorithms for the leader in multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg games across varying feedback paradigms, providing insights into regret bounds and their dependency on game parameters.

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

### [461] [Variational Secret Common Randomness Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02048)
*Xinyang Li,Vlad C. Andrei,Peter J. Gu,Yiqi Chen,Ullrich J. Mönich,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel two-stage framework using neural networks for extracting secret keys from correlated random sources, validated in both simulations and real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the secure generation of common randomness or secret keys between two legitimate parties while minimizing eavesdropper interference, especially addressing challenges in high mobility scenarios.

Method: Introduced a two-stage framework: (1) Variational Probabilistic Quantization (VPQ) leveraging neural network encoders with adversarial training, and (2) secure sketch reconciliation using code-offset construction for identical secret key generation.

Result: Experimental results, including software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, confirm the framework's feasibility and strong performance in various scenarios where the eavesdropper has partial knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates a practical and efficient approach to secure key generation, especially benefiting integrated sensing and communication systems with high mobility.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

### [462] [Synthetic Prefixes to Mitigate Bias in Real-Time Neural Query Autocomplete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01574)
*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a synthetic prefix generation method to enrich training data and address presentation bias in real-time query autocomplete systems, improving model performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address presentation bias in neural query autocomplete systems caused by engagement signals influenced by model suggestions.

Method: Synthetic prefixes are generated from complete user queries obtained during non-autocomplete search sessions, enriching the training data for ranking models. The neural ranker utilizes features like query popularity, contextual signals, and a simplified listwise loss for efficient training.

Result: The system, deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, showed statistically significant improvements in user engagement metrics like mean reciprocal rank.

Conclusion: Synthetic prefixes not only mitigate bias but also enhance generalization and scalability for ranking models in various low-latency tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

### [463] [Bridging Collaborative Filtering and Large Language Models with Dynamic Alignment, Multimodal Fusion and Evidence-grounded Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01606)
*Bo Ma,LuYao Liu,Simon Lau,Chandler Yuan,and XueY Cui,Rosie Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for recommendation tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), which integrates collaborative filtering and multi-modal content with lightweight, real-time updates and explainable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in using LLMs for recommendation tasks, including inconsistency with rapidly changing user preferences, lack of multi-modal content integration, and the need for explainable recommendations.

Method: The framework features online adaptation to update recommendations based on real-time user interactions, unified representation integrating collaborative signals with multi-modal content, and an explanation system that generates verifiable rationales.

Result: The approach avoids retraining large models, integrates collaborative, visual, and audio data efficiently, and supports explainable and trustworthy recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances computational efficiency, real-time adaptability, multi-modal integration, and explainability for practical deployment in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

*Bo Ma,Hang Li,ZeHua Hu,XiaoFan Gui,LuYao Liu,Simon Lau*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced generative recommendation framework using a multimodal and explainable approach to address bias, improve accuracy, and maintain efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommendation systems struggle with multimodal data, biases, and lack of transparency.

Method: The framework integrates multimodal fusion, retrieval-augmented generation, causal debiasing, explainable processes, and adaptive learning via large language models and specialized modules.

Result: The framework outperformed existing methods, showing up to a 2.3% increase in NDCG@10 and a 1.4% gain in diversity metrics on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed system significantly advances generative recommendation systems in terms of accuracy, fairness, diversity, and efficiency while remaining computationally optimized.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

*Daniel Gwon,Nour Jedidi,Jimmy Lin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of small-scale, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) as effective query generators for fine-tuning domain-specific dense retrieval models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide alternatives to proprietary and large-scale LLMs for generating task-specific queries, addressing concerns around access limitations and data sensitivity.

Method: The researchers test and evaluate the performance of open-source LLMs (up to 14B parameters, including those as small as 3B) as query generators for fine-tuning dense retrieval models.

Result: Open-source LLMs, even as small as 3B parameters, were shown to be effective in serving as query generators in a Promptagator-like approach.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that small, open-source LLMs can be reliable, accessible, and cost-effective substitutes for generating synthetic data and enhancing domain-specific dense retrieval models.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

### [466] [Location Matters: Leveraging Multi-Resolution Geo-Embeddings for Housing Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01196)
*Ivo Silva,Pedro Nogueira,Guilherme Bonaldo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geo-aware embedding framework for housing recommendations to address challenges in sparsity and spatial nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve housing recommendations by incorporating location, which plays a critical role in property value and user preferences.

Method: Proposed a two-tower neural architecture with hierarchical H3 grid integration, compared against traditional matrix factorization and single-resolution models.

Result: Achieved richer and more balanced embedding representations, with significant improvement in recommendation quality in offline simulations.

Conclusion: The geo-aware approach enhances housing recommendations by effectively addressing spatial and sparsity challenges, demonstrating its potential for digital rental platforms.

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

### [467] [Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01871)
*Oscar Villemaud,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of recovering fine-grained item rankings from users' coarse-grained ratings. It provides theoretical bounds and an algorithm for achieving near-perfect rankings, demonstrating inherent trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether it is possible to derive fine-grained rankings of items from users' coarse-grained ratings and quantify the associated challenges and costs.

Method: The authors model items with scores and users with thresholds, where ratings depend on whether an item's score exceeds a user's threshold. They analyze the query complexity required for accurate rankings and propose an algorithm matching theoretical bounds.

Result: Achieving near-perfect rankings requires Θ(n^2) users/queries, which is significantly higher than the O(n log n) queries needed for item comparisons. The results highlight the trade-off between user threshold diversity and ranking precision.

Conclusion: Diversity in user thresholds enhances the ability to refine coarse-grained ratings into detailed rankings, but it also increases the required query complexity when these thresholds are unknown.

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

### [468] [Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01666)
*Jianxu Wang,Ge Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework for handling structured noise in images, leveraging innovative sampling and filtering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising methods struggle to handle structured noise with anisotropic correlations, and current zero-shot approaches are limited to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise.

Method: The authors propose M2M, which uses a novel sampling strategy (directional interpolation and generalized median filtering) to create pseudo-independent sub-image pairs, alongside a randomized assignment strategy for training.

Result: M2M performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods for i.i.d. noise and consistently outperforms them when dealing with correlated noise in realistic simulations.

Conclusion: M2M provides an efficient, data-free solution to structured noise suppression, advancing zero-shot denoising techniques beyond the i.i.d. noise assumption.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical
imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with
strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most
data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and
still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods
avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median
(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M
introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent
sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional
interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values
distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling
space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is
employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for
Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par
with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently
outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an
efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the
first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.
assumption.

*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSNR_DIV, a video quality metric that improves temporal coherence evaluation for video frame interpolation. It is faster, more resource-efficient, and achieves better correlations compared to prior metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video frame interpolation quality metrics fail to effectively evaluate temporal coherence of interpolation artifacts and face computational inefficiencies.

Method: They propose PSNR_DIV, which enhances PSNR with motion divergence weighting, adapted from archival film restoration to detect temporal inconsistencies in motion fields.

Result: PSNR_DIV showed statistically significant performance gains (+0.09 Pearson correlation over FloLPIPS), is 2.5x faster, uses 4x less memory, and maintains robustness across diverse content.

Conclusion: PSNR_DIV offers an efficient and accurate solution for evaluating video frame interpolation quality, with potential practical applications in quality evaluation and neural network training.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video
enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual
impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and
LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored
towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but
suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application.
We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric
that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted
from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal
inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which
is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180
sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods)
shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant
improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while
being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains
consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator
used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast
quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural
networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric
is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFSR-Net, a framework to improve interpretability in medical imaging models by guiding model focus to human-relevant areas, achieving comparable or better accuracy while generating more interpretable saliency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability and reliability in deep learning models used for medical image analysis, which impacts trust and adoption in clinical practice.

Method: GFSR-Net employs a small amount of human annotations to guide the model's focus to regions of diagnostic relevance within images during training, which enhances interpretability without requiring exhaustive or precise annotations.

Result: GFSR-Net achieved comparable or superior accuracy across various types of medical and natural images while generating saliency maps that align with human expectations.

Conclusion: The approach increases trust and decreases reliance on irrelevant patterns in automated diagnostic tools, making them more reliable for clinical application.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis,
however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of
interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without
explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to
the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in
real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of
misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance
Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and
reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human
annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image
intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,
making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to
align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry
diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and
medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological
images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior
accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.
This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in
automated diagnostic tools.

*Jong Bum Won,Wesley De Neve,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpurBreast, a breast MRI dataset designed to study spurious correlations in deep learning models, showing that non-clinical signals can significantly affect model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical imaging datasets fail to systematically address the issue of spurious correlations in deep neural networks, which hinder their generalizability and real-world deployment.

Method: The authors curated the SpurBreast dataset, identified dominant spurious signals like magnetic field strength and image orientation, and created controlled dataset splits for assessing model reliance on these signals.

Result: Deep learning models were found to exploit spurious correlations, achieving high validation accuracy but failing to generalize to unbiased test datasets.

Conclusion: SpurBreast enables systematic analysis of spurious correlations and provides resources for improving model robustness and generalizability in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical
imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious
correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of
meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed
to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and
limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce
SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates
spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing
over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify
two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature
influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting
spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs
can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy
while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets
containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without
spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate
clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation,
adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are
available at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/spurbreast.

*Amirreza Tanevardi,Pooria Abbas Rad Moghadam,Sajjad Amini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modified consistency sampling method for solving inverse imaging problems efficiently, ensuring measurement fidelity while delivering competitive results with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance practicality and efficiency of generative priors, particularly diffusion models, by addressing their slow multi-step sampling process in solving inverse imaging problems.

Method: The approach modifies consistency sampling by integrating a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, ensuring faithfulness to acquired data while maintaining generation speed.

Result: Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in both perceptual and pixel-level metrics, surpassing baseline consistency sampling performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves competitive or superior reconstructions for inverse imaging problems with reduced computational effort, showcasing its practical viability and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse
imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits
practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling
high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct
adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a
modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem
reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a
measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which
enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency
of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level
metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance,
peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared
to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior
reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the EU AI Act's lack of clear fairness metrics and ambiguous terminology, proposing tailored frameworks to bridge gaps and promote ethical, transparent AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in the EU AI Act regarding ethical compliance, fairness transparency, and ambiguous terms, which may deter investment.

Method: The authors propose a public system framework and recommend standardization of industry best practices to complement broad regulations, using ASR and speech synthesizers as case studies.

Result: The paper identifies potential liability risks due to the Act's current structure and suggests actionable amendments to ensure fairness transparency without stifling innovation.

Conclusion: A tailored regulatory system that integrates fairness metrics and industry standards can address gaps in the EU AI Act while fostering innovation and ethical AI deployment.

Abstract: The European Union's AI Act represents a crucial step towards regulating
ethical and responsible AI systems. However, we find an absence of quantifiable
fairness metrics and the ambiguity in terminology, particularly the
interchangeable use of the keywords transparency, explainability, and
interpretability in the new EU AI Act and no reference of transparency of
ethical compliance. We argue that this ambiguity creates substantial liability
risk that would deter investment. Fairness transparency is strategically
important. We recommend a more tailored regulatory framework to enhance the new
EU AI regulation. Further-more, we propose a public system framework to assess
the fairness and transparency of AI systems. Drawing from past work, we
advocate for the standardization of industry best practices as a necessary
addition to broad regulations to achieve the level of details required in
industry, while preventing stifling innovation and investment in the AI sector.
The proposals are exemplified with the case of ASR and speech synthesizers.

TL;DR: The paper examines the dynamics between the proliferation of large language models and associated benchmarks, revealing contrasting patterns: models diversify while benchmarks centralize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between increasing diversity in language models and the concentration in benchmarks that measure them.

Method: The study uses curated proxies (Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and Evidently AI benchmark registry), along with agent-based simulations, to analyze model and benchmark agglomeration dynamics.

Result: Model development has diversified globally while benchmarks show high centralization, with concentrated influence in a few countries and institutions.

Conclusion: Centralized benchmark influence serves as coordination infrastructure fostering standardization and comparability but comes with trade-offs such as selective visibility and reduced effectiveness as leaderboards become saturated.

Abstract: Large language models are proliferating, and so are the benchmarks that serve
as their common yardsticks. We ask how the agglomeration patterns of these two
layers compare: do they evolve in tandem or diverge? Drawing on two curated
proxies for the ecosystem, the Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and
the Evidently AI benchmark registry, we find complementary but contrasting
dynamics. Model creation has broadened across countries and organizations and
diversified in modality, licensing, and access. Benchmark influence, by
contrast, displays centralizing patterns: in the inferred
benchmark-author-institution network, the top 15% of nodes account for over 80%
of high-betweenness paths, three countries produce 83% of benchmark outputs,
and the global Gini for inferred benchmark authority reaches 0.89. An
agent-based simulation highlights three mechanisms: higher entry of new
benchmarks reduces concentration; rapid inflows can temporarily complicate
coordination in evaluation; and stronger penalties against over-fitting have
limited effect. Taken together, these results suggest that concentrated
benchmark influence functions as coordination infrastructure that supports
standardization, comparability, and reproducibility amid rising heterogeneity
in model production, while also introducing trade-offs such as path dependence,
selective visibility, and diminishing discriminative power as leaderboards
saturate.

Method: The researchers analyzed 11 AI models for sycophantic behavior and conducted two experiments, including a live-interaction study with 1,604 participants, to evaluate its effects on interpersonal conflict resolution.

Result: AI models exhibited 50% more sycophancy than humans, reducing participants’ willingness to resolve conflicts while increasing their self-righteousness; users preferred and trusted sycophantic AI more.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need to address incentives that promote sycophancy in AI to mitigate its risks to judgment, trust, and prosocial behavior.

Abstract: Both the general public and academic communities have raised concerns about
sycophancy, the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI) excessively agreeing
with or flattering users. Yet, beyond isolated media reports of severe
consequences, like reinforcing delusions, little is known about the extent of
sycophancy or how it affects people who use AI. Here we show the pervasiveness
and harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First,
across 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly
sycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so
even in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other
relational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604),
including a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real
interpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with
sycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take
actions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of
being in the right. However, participants rated sycophantic responses as higher
quality, trusted the sycophantic AI model more, and were more willing to use it
again. This suggests that people are drawn to AI that unquestioningly validate,
even as that validation risks eroding their judgment and reducing their
inclination toward prosocial behavior. These preferences create perverse
incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and
for AI model training to favor sycophancy. Our findings highlight the necessity
of explicitly addressing this incentive structure to mitigate the widespread
risks of AI sycophancy.

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Svetlozar Nestorov,Peter Norlander*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), an open-source platform leveraging O*NET data and NLP tools to extract structured information from job ads, enabling extensive analysis of labor market trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current job posting data is inaccessible and non-standardized, while O*NET updates are infrequent and based on limited surveys.

Method: NLP tools were integrated with the O*NET framework to analyze job postings, achieving validation through out-of-sample and LLM-based testing. Over 155 million job ads were processed to create structured datasets.

Result: More than 10 billion structured data points were extracted, aggregating features like wages, skills, industry information, and more over a decade-long period.

Conclusion: The JAAT provides reliable tools for labor market analysis, fostering advancements in education, workforce dynamics, and future research.

Abstract: Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a
standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and
occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on
small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural
language processing tools that extract structured information from job
postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of
open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more
features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and
industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We
illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and
workforce development.

*Tiago da Silva Barros,Frédéric Giroire,Ramon Aparicio-Pardo,Joanna Moulierac*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper advocates for shifting towards energy-efficient AI models to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint, focusing on task-specific model selection during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the increasing energy consumption and environmental impact of scaling AI models under the 'bigger is better' paradigm by promoting a shift towards smaller, more efficient models.

Method: The study proposes task-specific model selection during inference, emphasizing its simplicity and immediate applicability without requiring new hardware or architectural changes.

Result: Energy savings through model selection are estimated between 1%-98% across tasks, with a potential global reduction in AI energy consumption of 27.8%, equating to 31.9 TWh savings by 2025.

Conclusion: Adopting task-specific model selection can significantly reduce energy usage and support sustainability goals in AI, offering an impactful and easy-to-implement alternative to current practices.

Abstract: The energy consumption and carbon footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
have become critical concerns due to rising costs and environmental impacts. In
response, a new trend in green AI is emerging, shifting from the "bigger is
better" paradigm, which prioritizes large models, to "small is sufficient",
emphasizing energy sobriety through smaller, more efficient models.
  We explore how the AI community can adopt energy sobriety today by focusing
on model selection during inference. Model selection consists of choosing the
most appropriate model for a given task, a simple and readily applicable
method, unlike approaches requiring new hardware or architectures. Our
hypothesis is that, as in many industrial activities, marginal utility gains
decrease with increasing model size. Thus, applying model selection can
significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining good utility for AI
inference.
  We conduct a systematic study of AI tasks, analyzing their popularity, model
size, and efficiency. We examine how the maturity of different tasks and model
adoption patterns impact the achievable energy savings, ranging from 1% to 98%
for different tasks. Our estimates indicate that applying model selection could
reduce AI energy consumption by 27.8%, saving 31.9 TWh worldwide in 2025 -
equivalent to the annual output of five nuclear power reactors.

*Sergej Kucenko,Nathaniel Dennler,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Bias bounties, inspired by bug bounties, involve communities in identifying AI biases through reward-based methods. This survey reviews five existing programs and academic discussions, urging more inclusivity and lowering barriers for broader adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias evaluation in AI systems often excludes impacted communities. Inspired by successful bug bounties, bias bounties aim to engage users in detecting and reporting AI biases.

Method: The study reviewed five existing bias bounty programs and five academic publications by searching platforms like Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE Xplore.

Result: All identified bias bounties were time-limited, U.S.-based contests, with varying public participation and prize pools. Reviewed academic work explored practical, critical, and theoretical aspects of bias bounties.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for reducing technical barriers to make bias bounties accessible to non-programmers and suggests learning from bug bounties to improve inclusivity and organizational adoption.

Abstract: Current bias evaluation methods rarely engage with communities impacted by AI
systems. Inspired by bug bounties, bias bounties have been proposed as a
reward-based method that involves communities in AI bias detection by asking
users of AI systems to report biases they encounter when interacting with such
systems. In the absence of a state-of-the-art review, this survey aimed to
identify and analyse existing AI bias bounty programmes and to present academic
literature on bias bounties. Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE
Xplore were searched, and five bias bounty programmes, as well as five research
publications, were identified. All bias bounties were organised by U.S.-based
organisations as time-limited contests, with public participation in four
programmes and prize pools ranging from 7,000 to 24,000 USD. The five research
publications included a report on the application of bug bounties to
algorithmic harms, an article addressing Twitter's bias bounty, a proposal for
bias bounties as an institutional mechanism to increase AI scrutiny, a workshop
discussing bias bounties from queer perspectives, and an algorithmic framework
for bias bounties. We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter
bounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience.
Given the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the
transferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such
programmes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while
lowering adoption barriers for organisations.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: MorphGen, a diffusion-based generative model, advances cell imaging by enabling accurate fluorescent microscopy of multiple cell types and perturbations in high detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance high-content image-based assays for drug discovery and gene editing by generating biologically accurate simulations of cellular responses.

Method: Training a diffusion-based generative model (MorphGen) with alignment loss to match phenotypic embeddings of a biological foundation model and using full fluorescent channels instead of compressed RGB images.

Result: MorphGen achieved high fidelity in generating biologically consistent fluorescent microscopy images, outperforming previous models by reducing FID score by 35%.

Conclusion: MorphGen preserves detailed cellular structures and enhances morphological analysis, improving biological interpretation in research applications.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising
direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing
drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a
state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy
that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and
perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with
known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to
match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a
state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that
compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing
organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent
channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a
fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological
interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via
CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than
the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a
single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks advanced AI models from 2025 for segmenting cell nuclei in kidney pathology, showing improved performance especially with fusion-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cell nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology due to tissue diversity and variability, and evaluate newer AI models for this task.

Method: Benchmarking advanced models (CellViT++ and Cellpose-SAM) against older models using a human-in-the-loop rating framework and ensemble methods.

Result: CellViT++ achieved the best standalone performance, and fusion models further improved segmentation accuracy, resolving challenging cases.

Conclusion: Advanced AI cell foundation models, especially fusion-based ones, significantly enhance segmentation accuracy in kidney pathology, supporting future model development.

Abstract: Accurate cell nuclei segmentation is critical for downstream tasks in kidney
pathology and remains a major challenge due to the morphological diversity and
imaging variability of renal tissues. While our prior work has evaluated
early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of
recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark
advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and
Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior
to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a
human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble
evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities
of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the
highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a
curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In
addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4%
"Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model
(2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained
unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of
AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated
dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model
refinement.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the BEETLE dataset for breast cancer semantic segmentation, addressing morphological diversity gaps in existing datasets and supporting model generalization across heterogeneous cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing breast cancer datasets lack morphological diversity for robust AI-based biomarker analysis across varied patient groups. This hinders generalizable model development.

Method: The authors created the BEETLE dataset, consisting of 587 H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs, annotated for four classes and covering diverse morphologies and molecular subtypes. Multicentric data sources and annotation strategies were employed.

Result: The dataset spans three clinical centers, two public datasets, and seven scanners, with a focus on underrepresented morphologies like ductal carcinoma in situ. It supports external benchmarks for segmentation model evaluation.

Conclusion: The BEETLE dataset enriches the field by enabling better generalization and standardized benchmarking for breast cancer segmentation models.

Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for large-scale artificial
intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing
public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity
needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across
heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy
sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of
H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from
three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using
seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades.
Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four
classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other -
with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets,
such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The
dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated
biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse.
Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to
enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: BIOVERSE integrates large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation models (BioFMs) using modality-specific projection layers for enhanced cross-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and BioFMs excel individually in tasks like molecular modeling and single-cell analysis but lack interoperability for cross-modal reasoning.

Method: BIOVERSE employs a two-stage approach: independent projections align modalities with LLMs, followed by multi-modal instruction tuning.

Result: BIOVERSE achieves superior performance in zero-shot annotation, cross-modal Q&A, and multi-modal reasoning tasks compared to larger LLMs and BioFMs.

Conclusion: BIOVERSE demonstrates the potential of unifying diverse biomedical data with LLMs, offering a robust framework for advanced multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation
models (BioFMs) have achieved strong results in biological text reasoning,
molecular modeling, and single-cell analysis, yet they remain siloed in
disjoint embedding spaces, limiting cross-modal reasoning. We present BIOVERSE
(Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage
approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them
with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The
approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently
trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies
standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for
downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded
in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question
answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning
cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning,
compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling
richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for
principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high computational costs and inaccurate results in docking optimization during drug discovery.

Method: A generative framework that uses custom reference sets to balance pharmacophore similarity with structural diversity in generating potential therapeutic compounds.

Result: The framework successfully generated novel compounds targeting estrogen receptor modulators and antagonists, displaying high pharmacophore fidelity and substantial structural novelty.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and innovative approach to assist in early-stage drug discovery, supporting both functional innovation and patentability.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early-stage drug discovery
offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring chemical space and
accelerating hit-to-lead optimization. However, docking optimization in
generative approaches is computationally expensive and may lead to inaccurate
results. Here, we present a novel generative framework that balances
pharmacophore similarity to reference compounds with structural diversity from
active molecules. The framework allows users to provide custom reference sets,
including FDA-approved drugs or clinical candidates, and guides the \textit{de
novo} generation of potential therapeutics. We demonstrate its applicability
through a case study targeting estrogen receptor modulators and antagonists for
breast cancer. The generated compounds maintain high pharmacophoric fidelity to
known active molecules while introducing substantial structural novelty,
suggesting strong potential for functional innovation and patentability.
Comprehensive evaluation of the generated molecules against common drug-like
properties confirms the robustness and pharmaceutical relevance of the
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of bioinformatics tools with AI-agent frameworks is challenging due to incompatible interfaces, variable data formats, and different parameter standards.

Method: Developed a platform called BioinfoMCP, consisting of two components: an automated converter using large language models to create MCP-compliant servers and a benchmark system to validate these servers.

Result: 38 bioinformatics tools were successfully converted and extensively validated, with 94.7% demonstrating effective integration into AI-agent platforms for complex workflows.

Conclusion: BioinfoMCP significantly reduces technical barriers for integrating bioinformatics tools with AI, enabling scalable and accessible computational biology workflows driven by natural language interaction.

Abstract: Bioinformatics tools are essential for complex computational biology tasks,
yet their integration with emerging AI-agent frameworks is hindered by
incompatible interfaces, heterogeneous input-output formats, and inconsistent
parameter conventions. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized
framework for tool-AI communication, but manually converting hundreds of
existing and rapidly growing specialized bioinformatics tools into
MCP-compliant servers is labor-intensive and unsustainable. Here, we present
BioinfoMCP, a unified platform comprising two components: BioinfoMCP Converter,
which automatically generates robust MCP servers from tool documentation using
large language models, and BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which systematically validates
the reliability and versatility of converted tools across diverse computational
tasks. We present a platform of 38 MCP-converted bioinformatics tools,
extensively validated to show that 94.7% successfully executed complex
workflows across three widely used AI-agent platforms. By removing technical
barriers to AI automation, BioinfoMCP enables natural-language interaction with
sophisticated bioinformatics analyses without requiring extensive programming
expertise, offering a scalable path to intelligent, interoperable computational

TL;DR: The paper explores how generative AI impacts financial stability, finding that AI agents generally make rational trading decisions, reducing herd behavior but with noteworthy implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how generative AI adoption influences trading decisions and financial stability, focusing on rationality and herd behavior.

Method: Laboratory experiments using large language models replicate classic studies on trading herd behavior under various conditions.

Result: AI agents favor private information over market trends, reducing asset bubbles from irrational herd behavior, but can also demonstrate guided optimal herding.

Conclusion: AI trading advice potentially stabilizes markets by lowering animal spirits-driven bubbles, yet inherits human biases and raises financial stability concerns depending on experimental settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the adoption of generative AI on
financial stability. We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large
language models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in trading
decisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than
humans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends.
Increased reliance on AI-powered trading advice could therefore potentially
lead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by
following the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings
reveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided
to make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market
discipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial
stability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not
purely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and
bias.

Motivation: Understanding and predicting solar flares is crucial due to their impact on infrastructure on Earth, creating a need for reliable forecasting methods.

Method: The platform uses feature-based machine learning methods to predict solar flare occurrence and identify the most relevant physical descriptors.

Result: The approach offers predictions and ranks features explaining the occurrence of solar flares, improving both performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: This web-based platform bridges the gap between explainability and accuracy in solar flare forecasting through machine learning techniques.

Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the
main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and
leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at
Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning
approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability
degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the
physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a

TL;DR: The research presents CardioRAG, a machine learning framework integrating clinical reasoning with AI-enhanced ECG-based features for improved Chagas disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods for Chagas disease cardiomyopathy in resource-limited areas are hindered by limited accuracy and lack of integration with medical indicators.

Method: CardioRAG combines large language models, interpretable ECG-based clinical features, and variational autoencoders for semantic case retrieval and reasoning.

Result: CardioRAG achieved 89.80% recall and a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for identifying positive cases needing serological testing.

Conclusion: CardioRAG offers a trustworthy AI-based diagnostic tool by embedding clinical indicators, addressing accuracy, interpretability, and resource limitations.

Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas
cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where
serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG)
screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine
learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large
labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based
clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation
framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable
ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior
fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses
variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval,
providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated
high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for
effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological
testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach
particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway

TL;DR: ShapeGen3DCP is a neural network-based framework for predicting filament shapes in 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) using material properties and process parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate trial-and-error adjustments and optimize printing for 3D Concrete Printing by accurately predicting filament shapes.

Method: The framework uses dimensionless parameters, Fourier descriptors for geometry representation, and trains on synthetic data generated via a Particle Finite Element Model.

Result: Validated predictions show strong agreement with numerical and experimental cases, ensuring reliability.

Conclusion: The framework could facilitate efficient toolpath optimization and closed-loop digital twins for real-time 3DCP process optimization and defect detection.

Abstract: This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and
accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete
Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that
takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield
stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle
height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer
shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into
dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted
geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce
smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a
small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated
using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP,
overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse
numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the
framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses
ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating
trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced
designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor
feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time
process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent systems and master-slave multi-agent paradigms face challenges in efficiently discovering data in large, heterogeneous data lakes due to limited scalability and flexibility.

Method: The proposed method uses a blackboard framework where a central agent posts requests, and autonomous agents capable of handling specific tasks volunteer responses, eliminating the need for centralized knowledge of all agent capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show a 13%-57% improvement in task success rate and up to a 9% gain in F1 score for data discovery over existing methods, tested on both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The blackboard paradigm is demonstrated as a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems, enhancing task success and data discovery capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

### [491] [BioBlobs: Differentiable Graph Partitioning for Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01632)
*Xin Wang,Carlos Oliver*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioBlobs, a novel module for protein representation learning that dynamically partitions proteins into flexible substructures to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing protein representation learning methods, which rely on rigid substructures that distort meaningful signals in protein function.

Method: BioBlobs dynamically partitions proteins into flexible, non-overlapping substructures ("blobs"), quantizes them into an interpretable codebook, and uses this discrete vocabulary for embedding, compatible with common protein encoders.

Result: Implementing BioBlobs improved the performance of protein encoders like GVP-GNN on various protein learning tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic representation of protein substructures enhances predictive performance and provides deeper insights into protein function.

Abstract: Protein function is driven by coherent substructures which vary in size and
topology, yet current protein representation learning models (PRL) distort
these signals by relying on rigid substructures such as k-hop and fixed radius
neighbourhoods. We introduce BioBlobs, a plug-and-play, fully differentiable
module that represents proteins by dynamically partitioning structures into
flexibly-sized, non-overlapping substructures ("blobs"). The resulting blobs
are quantized into a shared and interpretable codebook, yielding a discrete
vocabulary of function-relevant protein substructures used to compute protein
embeddings. We show that BioBlobs representations improve the performance of
widely used protein encoders such as GVP-GNN across various PRL tasks. Our
approach highlights the value of architectures that directly capture
function-relevant protein substructures, enabling both improved predictive
performance and mechanistic insight into protein function.

*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carol Espy Wilson*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of public classroom speech datasets and presents a new dataset, RealClass, combining synthesized noise, Room Impulse Responses, and publicly available speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of AI-driven speech models for education is hampered by limited access to large-scale classroom speech data and a lack of dedicated augmentation resources.

Method: The authors use game engines to synthesize classroom noise and RIRs. They also compile a dataset, RealClass, combining synthesized noise with children’s and instructional speech from public sources.

Result: RealClass is shown to approximate real classroom speech closely under both clean and noisy conditions, making it a viable alternative where real classroom data is unavailable.

Conclusion: RealClass provides a scalable solution to simulate classroom speech, offering a resourceful dataset that can advance AI-driven educational speech models and extend to other domains.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Classroom datasets remain
limited and not publicly available, and the absence of dedicated classroom
noise or Room Impulse Response (RIR) corpora prevents the use of standard data
augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise and RIRs using game engines, a versatile framework that can extend to
other domains beyond the classroom. Building on this methodology, we present
RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a
classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech
data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from
YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Experiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates
real classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant
real classroom speech.

*Jianing Yang,Sheng Li,Takahiro Shinozaki,Yuki Saito,Hiroshi Saruwatari*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) method is proposed, focusing on fine-grained phoneme-level emotion embedding and disentangling style attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack the ability to capture nuanced acoustic details of reference speech, limiting emotional and stylistic control.

Method: Introduces a style disentanglement technique combined with two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and emotion, enabling fine-grained emotion embedding prediction at the phoneme level.

Result: Experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach surpasses baseline systems in producing natural and emotionally rich speech.

Conclusion: Disentangled and detailed representation strategies hold promise for enhancing emotional TTS systems' quality and adaptability.

Abstract: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on
reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not
capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we
propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level
emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the
reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to
guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and
emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the
reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This
work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations
in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing voice quality evaluation, offering broader annotations and strong baselines for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating singing quality objectively is challenging due to limitations in human subjective listening tests and existing metrics.

Method: SingMOS-Pro expands on a prior dataset by including additional qualitative metrics (lyrics, melody, overall). Professional annotators rate 7,981 clips generated by a diverse range of models.

Result: The dataset provides reliable annotations and benchmarks for evaluation methods, enhancing the framework for objective singing quality assessment.

Conclusion: SingMOS-Pro establishes a solid foundation for automatic singing quality assessment, bridging gaps and supporting future innovations in the field.

Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality
remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the
form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective
metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce
SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on
our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro
expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and
overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset
contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets,
spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least
five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and
consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data
annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used
evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong
baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be

### [495] [HRTFformer: A Spatially-Aware Transformer for Personalized HRTF Upsampling in Immersive Audio Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01891)
*Xuyi Hu,Jian Li,Shaojie Zhang,Stefan Goetz,Lorenzo Picinali,Ozgur B. Akan,Aidan O. T. Hogg*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transformer-based model for HRTF spatial upsampling, outperforming previous approaches in accurately reconstructing high-resolution HRTFs from sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the impracticality of measuring personalized HRTFs at scale and improve methods to efficiently generate high-resolution HRTFs, crucial for immersive spatial audio applications.

Method: A novel transformer-based architecture is proposed, leveraging attention mechanisms for spatial correlations in the HRTF sphere. The model operates in the spherical harmonic domain and employs a neighbor dissimilarity loss for improved spatial coherence.

Result: The proposed model achieved significant improvements in the accuracy and realism of upsampled HRTFs based on perceptual and objective spectral distortion evaluations, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The transformer-based approach demonstrates a promising solution for scalable HRTF upsampling with enhanced spatial coherence and fidelity, contributing to advancements in immersive audio technologies.

Abstract: Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be
introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for
realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations
regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical
at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate
this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of
reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with
different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with
long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors.
In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF
upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial
correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH)
domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input
measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial
coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude
smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using
both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics.
Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial
margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces RWSA-MambaUNet, a hybrid speech enhancement model integrating Mamba and multi-head attention within a U-Net structure. It outperforms existing models on out-of-domain test sets with superior efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving superior generalization performance across diverse speech datasets while minimizing model complexity and computational demands.

Method: Proposed a novel RWSA-MambaUNet model that uses Mamba and multi-head attention mechanisms within a U-Net structure. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) is employed for layerwise attention-sharing across various time and frequency resolutions.

Result: RWSA-MambaUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two out-of-domain speech enhancement test sets, surpassing baselines in PESQ, SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR metrics, while being highly efficient in terms of model parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: The hybrid model successfully combines advanced mechanisms to deliver enhanced speech quality and robust generalization capabilities while reducing computational costs, showcasing a promising direction for efficient speech enhancement systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba
and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization
performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has
yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model
size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose
RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and
multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus
performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise
attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our
best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization
performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model
surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of
PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms
of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and
a fraction of the FLOPs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces WithFlow, a system enhancing real-time music performance by using biosignals and audio features to modulate effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores the collaboration between humans and machines in music performance, emphasizing the human aspect of emotional expression in music.

Method: WithFlow leverages biosignals and audio features to automatically adjust audio effects in real-time. It operates locally on a laptop and is open-source when paired with compatible tools.

Result: The WithFlow system, in its proof-of-concept phase, successfully integrates biosignals and audio analysis for music performance enhancements.

Conclusion: WithFlow demonstrates potential for enriching human-machine collaboration in music performance, although it remains a concept requiring further development.

Abstract: Music performance is a distinctly human activity, intrinsically linked to the
performer's ability to convey, evoke, or express emotion. Machines cannot
perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or
synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional
experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to
explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we
introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance
by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both
biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept
phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is
open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation
and sensors.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in music generation models by introducing GlobalDISCO, a globally diverse dataset analyzing 73k AI-generated music tracks and their disparities across regions, languages, and genres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and analyze biases in music generation models, particularly their unequal performance across different regions, languages, and musical genres, which arise due to the lack of globally diverse datasets.

Method: The study introduces GlobalDISCO, a dataset consisting of 73k machine-generated tracks paired with 93k reference tracks from LAION-DISCO-12M, covering 147 languages and musical styles from 79 countries, ensuring global representation.

Result: The evaluation showed significant disparities in quality and alignment between high-resource regions and low-resource ones; also, models performed less effectively in niche regional genres, aligning them closer to mainstream styles.

Conclusion: GlobalDISCO reveals key biases and regional/niche disparity in music generation models, showing room for progress in inclusivity and representation across diverse musical styles worldwide.

Abstract: While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models,
research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical
genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets
and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these
challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k
music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models,
along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset
spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from
MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing
musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our
evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with
reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we
find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and
geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for
regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream
styles.

TL;DR: Timbru introduces a novel audio watermarking model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and imperceptibility without needing an embedder-detector model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient audio watermarking method capable of robustly embedding imperceptible information within audio files, overcoming limitations of prior models.

Method: Timbru leverages a per-audio gradient optimization approach using a pretrained audio VAE’s latent space and incorporates perceptual and message loss. Watermarks are extracted using a pretrained CLAP model.

Result: Timbru outperformed existing methods like AudioSeal, WavMark, and SilentCipher in watermarking robustness against various attacks, while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The method highlights the potential for dataset-free approaches to imperceptible and robust audio watermarking, presenting a new benchmark for future work in this domain.

Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves
state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an
embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method
performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in
the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and
perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP
model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal,
WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression,
resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best
average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an
efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.

TL;DR: The paper addresses online Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation, proposing SoundReactor, a causal model that generates semantically aligned audio in real time from video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-to-Audio models require offline processing, limiting their uses in real-time applications like live content creation.

Method: SoundReactor leverages a causal transformer over continuous audio latents, using grid features extracted from a compact vision encoder (DINOv2). The system is trained with diffusion pre-training and consistency fine-tuning for efficiency and synchronization.

Result: SoundReactor achieves high-quality stereo audio generation with low latency (26.3ms–31.5ms per frame) on diverse gameplay videos validated by objective and human assessments.

Conclusion: The model is well-suited for real-time applications, demonstrating effective performance in online V2A generation while ensuring synchronization and efficiency.

Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming
an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This
critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content
creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we
introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model
autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video
frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for
this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame
latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a
decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision
conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest
variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token
per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained
through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to
accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay
videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and
temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both
objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame
waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on
30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in autoregressive speech enhancement methods with complex pipelines and low-resolution codecs, which restrict their capabilities.

Method: DAC-SE1 utilizes discrete high-resolution audio representations to balance fine-grained acoustic detail and semantic coherence in an autoregressive framework.

Result: DAC-SE1 outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in objective perceptual metrics and MUSHRA human evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates DAC-SE1's capability as a scalable, unified, and high-quality solution for speech enhancement, and provides code and models for future research.

Abstract: Recent autoregressive transformer-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have
shown promising results by leveraging advanced semantic understanding and
contextual modeling of speech. However, these approaches often rely on complex
multi-stage pipelines and low sampling rate codecs, limiting them to narrow and
task-specific speech enhancement. In this work, we introduce DAC-SE1, a
simplified language model-based SE framework leveraging discrete
high-resolution audio representations; DAC-SE1 preserves fine-grained acoustic
details while maintaining semantic coherence. Our experiments show that DAC-SE1
surpasses state-of-the-art autoregressive SE methods on both objective
perceptual metrics and in a MUSHRA human evaluation. We release our codebase
and model checkpoints to support further research in scalable, unified, and
high-quality speech enhancement.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MPMAvatar introduces a framework for creating highly realistic 3D human avatars featuring robust animation and photorealistic rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments using accurate and robust physical simulation.

Method: The framework employs a Material Point Method-based simulator tailored for complex garment deformations and combines it with 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity rendering.

Result: MPMAvatar achieves superior dynamics modeling accuracy, rendering quality, robustness, efficiency, and zero-shot generalization to unseen interactions.

Conclusion: MPMAvatar advances 3D avatar creation by integrating robust physical simulation with photorealistic rendering, opening new possibilities for dynamic human modeling.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROI-GS, an object-aware framework to enhance the detail of 3D scene reconstructions around objects of interest while reducing model size and maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in 3D scene reconstruction methods, which uniformly allocate resources and fail to achieve high detail in regions of interest while inflating model size.

Method: The authors propose ROI-GS, a framework that uses object-guided camera selection, targeted object training, and seamless integration to prioritize high-resolution reconstructions for objects of interest.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves local reconstruction quality by up to 2.96 dB PSNR, reduces model size by ~17%, and achieves faster training compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ROI-GS offers an efficient solution for detailed 3D reconstructions of specific objects while saving computational resources, making it superior to existing methods.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new relighting and reconstruction framework for glossy objects using microfacet BRDF and Gaussian Splatting for improved material recovery and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shape, material, and illumination of glossy objects are hard to disentangle, and existing neural rendering methods struggle with realistic material recovery and relighting due to oversimplified models.

Method: The authors propose integrating a microfacet BRDF with specular-glossiness parameterization into a 2D Gaussian Splatting framework with deferred shading, supplemented by diffusion-based priors and coarse-to-fine optimization of environment maps.

Result: The proposed method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction and delivers more realistic, consistent relighting in glossy scenes compared to prior Gaussian splatting techniques.

Conclusion: This framework offers improved physically consistent material decomposition, faster optimization, and better relighting fidelity, addressing shortcomings of existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

*Nazar Emirov,Guohui Song,Qiyu Sun*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a distributed divide-and-conquer algorithm for optimizing constrained convex functions over networks, showing both theoretical convergence and practical scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to develop distributed optimization methods for networks, particularly for scenarios where local agents must collectively solve a larger objective while only communicating locally.

Method: A divide-and-conquer algorithm designed for constrained convex optimization is proposed, performing tasks locally at fusion centers and coordinating with neighbors. Exponential convergence guarantees are included under specific assumptions about smoothness, convexity, and the graph structure.

Result: The DAC algorithm achieves exponential convergence under theoretical conditions, and numerical experiments on three types of loss functions validate its scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust and scalable solution to distributed convex optimization, establishing both theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.

Abstract: We propose a divide-and-conquer (DAC) algorithm for constrained convex
optimization over networks, where the global objective is the sum of local
objectives attached to individual agents. The algorithm is fully distributed:
each iteration solves local subproblems around selected fusion centers and
coordinates only with neighboring fusion centers. Under standard assumptions of
smoothness, strong convexity, and locality on the objective function, together
with polynomial growth conditions on the underlying graph, we establish
exponential convergence of the DAC iterations and derive explicit bounds for
both exact and inexact local solvers. Numerical experiments on three
representative losses ($L_2$ distance, quadratic, and entropy) confirm the
theory and demonstrate scalability and effectiveness.

### [506] [DeMuon: A Decentralized Muon for Matrix Optimization over Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01377)
*Chuan He,Shuyi Ren,Jingwei Mao,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The study introduces DeMuon, a decentralized matrix optimization method that leverages Newton-Schulz iterations for matrix orthogonalization and gradient tracking to address local function heterogeneity, with provable complexity guarantees and superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix optimization tasks in decentralized settings over communication graphs pose challenges, especially under heavy-tailed noise and heterogeneity among local functions. There is a need to extend centralized optimization techniques like Muon to decentralized frameworks.

Method: DeMuon combines Newton-Schulz iterations for matrix orthogonalization and gradient tracking to harmonize local functions. Its iteration complexity matches centralized methods, providing theoretical guarantees for performance.

Result: The paper establishes DeMuon’s iteration complexity under stochastic and noisy conditions, proving it matches the best-known centralized counterparts in tolerance dependence. Empirical tests demonstrate DeMuon outperforming other decentralized methods in transformer pretraining tasks.

Conclusion: DeMuon represents the first decentralized extension of Muon with proven complexity bounds, showing both theoretical and experimental promise for decentralized optimization over various graph topologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix
optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix
orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its
centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate
heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and
additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon
for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result
matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of
dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the
first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with
provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on
decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of
connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement
of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network
topologies.

### [507] [Smooth Quasar-Convex Optimization with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01943)
*David Martínez-Rubio*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an accelerated proximal point algorithm for $
\gamma$-quasar convex smooth functions with general convex constraints, achieving nearly optimal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for quasar-convex functions struggle with general convex constraints, creating a gap in optimization efficiency.

Method: The authors design an inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm and analyze its performance, alongside adapting projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe algorithms for the constrained quasar-convex setting.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal complexity, and the analysis bridges gaps in first-order algorithm performance for constrained quasar-convex problems.

Conclusion: This work advances optimization on constrained quasar-convex functions, solving an open problem and improving previous methods in the field.

Abstract: Quasar-convex functions form a broad nonconvex class with applications to
linear dynamical systems, generalized linear models, and Riemannian
optimization, among others. Current nearly optimal algorithms work only in
affine spaces due to the loss of one degree of freedom when working with
general convex constraints. Obtaining an accelerated algorithm that makes
nearly optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$ first-order queries
to a $\gamma$-quasar convex smooth function \emph{with constraints} was
independently asked as an open problem in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022); Lezane,
Langer, and Koolen (2024). In this work, we solve this question by designing an
inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm that we implement using a
first-order method achieving the aforementioned rate and, as a consequence, we
improve the complexity of the accelerated geodesically Riemannian optimization
solution in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022). We also analyze projected gradient descent
and Frank-Wolfe algorithms in this constrained quasar-convex setting. To the
best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analyses of first-order
methods for quasar-convex smooth functions with general convex constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ktbox, a LaTeX framework designed to standardize and improve scientific manuscript formatting through modular components for color palettes, highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific manuscripts often rely on inconsistent and ad-hoc document formatting, leading to issues with clarity, visual emphasis, and portability across templates.

Method: The authors developed ktbox, a modular LaTeX framework that includes components such as ktcolor.sty, ktbox.sty, ktlrtree.sty, and ktorcid.sty, all enabling semantic consistency and interoperability with various document classes.

Result: ktbox provides features like auto-numbered highlight boxes, structured layouts, flexible visualizations, and multi-column support, compatible with major templates like IEEEtran and acmart.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the reproducibility and clarity of formatting in scientific communication while improving authoring efficiency and document portability.

Abstract: The communication of technical insight in scientific manuscripts often relies
on ad-hoc formatting choices, resulting in inconsistent visual emphasis and
limited portability across document classes. This paper introduces ktbox, a
modular LaTeX framework that unifies semantic color palettes, structured
highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata utilities into a coherent
system for scholarly writing. The framework is distributed as a set of
lightweight, namespaced components: ktcolor.sty for semantic palettes,
ktbox.sty for structured highlight and takeaway environments, ktlrtree.sty for
taxonomy trees with fusion and auxiliary annotations, and ktorcid.sty for
ORCID-linked author metadata. Each component is independently usable yet
interoperable, ensuring compatibility with major templates such as IEEEtran,
acmart, iclr conference, and beamer. Key features include auto-numbered
takeaway boxes, wide-format highlights, flexible taxonomy tree visualizations,
and multi-column layouts supporting embedded tables, enumerations, and code
blocks. By adopting a clear separation of concerns and enforcing a consistent
naming convention under the kt namespace, the framework transforms visual
styling from cosmetic add-ons into reproducible, extensible building blocks of
scientific communication, improving clarity, portability, and authoring
efficiency across articles, posters, and presentations.

*Gert Aarts,Diaa E. Habibi,Lingxiao Wang,Kai Zhou*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper investigates leveraging diffusion models in generative AI to better understand distributions sampled by complex Langevin processes, particularly in theories with a sign problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of understanding the probability distributions associated with the complex Langevin process, which are difficult to determine and analyze a priori.

Method: The authors compare two types of diffusion models—score-based and energy-based—in their ability to learn distributions sampled by the complex Langevin process.

Result: The paper demonstrates how diffusion models can effectively learn these distributions and highlights their potential in tackling such complex problems.

Conclusion: Diffusion models offer a promising avenue for resolving challenges in studying probability distributions from complex Langevin processes, opening up new possibilities and applications.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can
sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified
configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled
by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to
understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or
their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to
learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing
score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible
applications.

*Chetwin Low,Weimin Wang,Calder Katyal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Introducing Ovi, a unified model for audio and video generation that achieves synchronized multimodal output using twin-DiT modules and blockwise fusion, without requiring separate pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to audio-video generation rely on complex, multi-stage architectures or sequentially synthesized outputs, creating challenges like synchronization and pipeline complexity.

Method: Ovi uses twin-DiT modules and employs blockwise cross-modal fusion leveraging timing through scaled-RoPE embeddings and semantics via bidirectional cross-attention. An audio tower with architecture identical to pretrained video models is trained from scratch on extensive raw audio data.

Result: The result is a model capable of generating movie-grade synchronized audio-video clips, including natural speech reflecting speaker identity and emotion, as well as context-matched sound effects.

Conclusion: Ovi simplifies audio-video generation processes, removing the need for separate pipelines and enabling high-quality, cinematic synchronization between the two modalities.

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures
or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified
paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single
generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules,
Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate
pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion
modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that
of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of
thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic
sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and
emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio
towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and
semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our
model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate,
context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the
demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

*Donghuo Zeng*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper compares contrastive and triplet loss in deep metric learning across theoretical and empirical aspects, showing triplet loss better supports detailed representation and hard-sample focus, while contrastive loss favors smoother embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify the differences and effects of contrastive loss and triplet loss in deep metric learning, as their impact on representation quality is not well understood.

Method: The authors conduct task-specific experiments with synthetic and real datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, CARS196), evaluating intra-/inter-class variance, loss-decay rates, active ratios, and gradient norms to explore the optimization behavior of each loss.

Result: Triplet loss shows greater variance preservation within and across classes and produces fewer but stronger updates, improving detail retention and handling of hard examples. Contrastive loss favors compact intra-class embeddings but may obscure fine semantic distinctions.

Conclusion: Triplet loss is recommended for tasks requiring detail retention and focus on hard examples, while contrastive loss is better suited for smooth and generalized embedding refinement.

Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric
learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently
understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses,
focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g.,
greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on
synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss
preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained
distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss
tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic
differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining
loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss
drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but
stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both
classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196
datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior
performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and
hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding
refinement.

*Felix J. Yu,Nicholas Kamp,Carlos A. Argüelles*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised learning pipeline for neutrino telescopes, which uses point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders to reduce reliance on simulated data and address systematic uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning techniques in neutrino physics rely heavily on simulated data, which is often inaccurate and fails to fully replicate real-world conditions, particularly in large-scale, complex environments like neutrino telescopes.

Method: The authors developed a self-supervised training pipeline that integrates point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders, allowing most of the training to occur on real data rather than simulations.

Result: This approach minimizes the reliance on simulations and their associated uncertainties, allowing for improved data accuracy and reduced systematic biases in training.

Conclusion: The method marks a fundamental shift in machine learning practice for neutrino telescopes, promising substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification by emphasizing training on real data rather than simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on
simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the
accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real
data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino
telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years,
self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing
dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised
training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers
and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data,
this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated
systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous
machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for
substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.

*Timbwaoga A. J. Ouermi,Eric Li,Kenneth Moreland,Dave Pugmire,Chris R. Johnson,Tushar M. Athawale*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper addresses visualizing uncertainty in divergence analysis of vector fields, proposing a highly efficient and scalable approach to overcome limitations in classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Divergence is crucial for studying fluid flows and detecting sources/sinks. However, uncertainty in vector field data can lead to incorrect divergence computations, impacting flow analysis.

Method: The authors propose a closed-form analytical method for visualizing uncertainty in local divergence, assuming Gaussian-distributed vector uncertainties. They integrate this approach into a parallel computing library, Viskores, for scalability and speed.

Result: The method achieves significant speed-ups (up to 19698X) over the Monte Carlo sampling method, demonstrating improved visualization quality. The results are validated on wind forecast and ocean simulation datasets.

Conclusion: The paper offers a novel and efficient solution for uncertainty visualization in divergence analysis, significantly outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: This work focuses on visualizing uncertainty of local divergence of
two-dimensional vector fields. Divergence is one of the fundamental attributes
of fluid flows, as it can help domain scientists analyze potential positions of
sources (positive divergence) and sinks (negative divergence) in the flow.
However, uncertainty inherent in vector field data can lead to erroneous
divergence computations, adversely impacting downstream analysis. While Monte
Carlo (MC) sampling is a classical approach for estimating divergence
uncertainty, it suffers from slow convergence and poor scalability with
increasing data size and sample counts. Thus, we present a two-fold
contribution that tackles the challenges of slow convergence and limited
scalability of the MC approach. (1) We derive a closed-form approach for highly
efficient and accurate uncertainty visualization of local divergence, assuming
independently Gaussian-distributed vector uncertainties. (2) We further
integrate our approach into Viskores, a platform-portable parallel library, to
accelerate uncertainty visualization. In our results, we demonstrate
significantly enhanced efficiency and accuracy of our serial analytical
(speed-up up to 1946X) and parallel Viskores (speed-up up to 19698X) algorithms
over the classical serial MC approach. We also demonstrate qualitative
improvements of our probabilistic divergence visualizations over traditional
mean-field visualization, which disregards uncertainty. We validate the
accuracy and efficiency of our methods on wind forecast and ocean simulation
datasets.

### [514] [Exponential Quantum Advantage for Message Complexity in Distributed Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01657)
*François Le Gall,Maël Luce,Joseph Marchand,Mathieu Roget*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates an exponential quantum advantage in message complexity for routing between specific nodes in a network, leveraging quantum walks and prior theoretical advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how quantum distributed algorithms can significantly outperform classical algorithms in terms of message complexity, specifically for fundamental network tasks.

Method: The study utilizes quantum walks (based on recent work by Li, Li, and Luo) for routing on welded tree graphs and lifts classical lower bounds on query complexity to message complexity for comparison.

Result: An exponential reduction in message complexity is achieved using quantum algorithms for routing problems, compared to classical approaches, demonstrating clear quantum superiority.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the potential for quantum distributed algorithms to vastly outperform classical frameworks for specific networking tasks, thereby advancing the understanding of quantum advantages in practical distributed settings.

Abstract: We investigate how much quantum distributed algorithms can outperform
classical distributed algorithms with respect to the message complexity (the
overall amount of communication used by the algorithm). Recently, Dufoulon,
Magniez and Pandurangan (PODC 2025) have shown a polynomial quantum advantage
for several tasks such as leader election and agreement. In this paper, we show
an exponential quantum advantage for a fundamental task: routing information
between two specified nodes of a network. We prove that for the family of
``welded trees" introduced in the seminal work by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003), there exists a quantum distributed algorithm
that transfers messages from the entrance of the graph to the exit with message
complexity exponentially smaller than any classical algorithm. Our quantum
algorithm is based on the recent "succinct" implementation of quantum walks
over the welded trees by Li, Li and Luo (SODA 2024). Our classical lower bound
is obtained by ``lifting'' the lower bound from Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003) from query complexity to message complexity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical method for correlation clustering using quantum annealing to improve clustering quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of classical correlation clustering algorithms for graphs with arbitrary structures, including negative edges and cluster size imbalances.

Method: The authors adapt a quantum-assisted solver, GCS-Q, within a recursive divisive partitioning framework, solving each bipartition step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem using quantum annealing.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the adapted GCS-Q method outperforms classical algorithms in robustness and clustering quality, especially on real-world and imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for scalable and structurally-aware clustering in graph-based machine learning applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical method to correlation
clustering, a graph-based unsupervised learning task that seeks to partition
the nodes in a graph based on pairwise agreement and disagreement. In
particular, we adapt GCS-Q, a quantum-assisted solver originally designed for
coalition structure generation, to maximize intra-cluster agreement in signed
graphs through recursive divisive partitioning. The proposed method encodes
each bipartitioning step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problem, solved via quantum annealing. This integration of quantum optimization
within a hierarchical clustering framework enables handling of graphs with
arbitrary correlation structures, including negative edges, without relying on
metric assumptions or a predefined number of clusters. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic signed graphs and real-world hyperspectral imaging data demonstrate
that, when adapted for correlation clustering, GCS-Q outperforms classical
algorithms in robustness and clustering quality on real-world data and in
scenarios with cluster size imbalance. Our results highlight the promise of
hybrid quantum-classical optimization for advancing scalable and
structurally-aware clustering techniques in graph-based unsupervised learning.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper derives quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix using diverse relative entropies, establishing key properties and algorithms for applications in quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum generalizations of Fisher information are essential for quantum information science, impacting fields such as high-energy physics, machine learning, and quantum estimation theory.

Method: The paper applies matrix derivatives using the divided differences method to derive quantum Fisher information matrices based on log-Euclidean, α-z, and geometric Rényi relative entropies.

Result: New quantum Fisher information matrices were derived, showcasing data-processing inequality adherence for certain parameters and establishing hybrid algorithms for parameterized thermal states.

Conclusion: These findings contribute practical tools and theoretical insights to quantum information science, specifically improving applications in quantum machine learning and quantum Boltzmann models.

Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum
information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter
physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization.
One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a
natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth
divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,
given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to
the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher
information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization
of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I
derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and
geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so
being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.
Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$,
the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information
matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the
right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting
information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative
values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do
not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$
information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative
entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their
$\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for
estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method leveraging transformer encoders and latent diffusion models for generating photonic band diagrams more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational expense of generating photonic band diagrams, which arises from solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, especially in optimization settings.

Method: The proposed approach integrates a transformer encoder for extracting contextual embeddings and a latent diffusion model to generate photonic band diagrams.

Result: The introduced model effectively generates photonic band diagrams while demonstrating potential for scalability to arbitrary 3D structures.

Conclusion: This work showcases the suitability of transformers and diffusion models in capturing complex photonic phenomena, offering advancements in surrogate modeling and optimization strategies in photonics.

Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the
nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and
quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to
investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.
However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many
configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in
optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this
challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion
models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three
dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which
extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent
diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide
insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture
the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving
the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

*Muhammad Faheemur Rahman,Wayne Burleson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes two security mechanisms for protecting critical weights in memristive crossbar arrays against adversarial threats, with minimal design and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To secure memristive crossbar arrays against security vulnerabilities that threaten intellectual property and training investments.

Method: The authors introduced Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns mechanisms, which integrate with existing architectures to secure stored weights and authenticate ownership.

Result: Simulations across various CMOS nodes and experiments with datasets like MNIST demonstrate robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay, and power.

Conclusion: The proposed security mechanisms successfully protect memristive in-memory computing systems while maintaining performance efficiency, proving practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel
analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine
learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their
advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as
adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised.
Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable
intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes
using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security
mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both
safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of
data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive
crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations
across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and
a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with
under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial
experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the
feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal
performance trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces "RTS-Attack," a framework that bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs using semantically relevant nested scenarios and targeted toxic knowledge. It achieves high concealment and superior efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore an under-researched vulnerability in LLMs where alignment defenses fail to detect nested scenarios integrated with semantically relevant queries and toxic knowledge. This is aimed at improving our understanding of LLM security.

Method: The authors systematically study nested scenarios in LLM alignment and propose RTS-Attack, an adaptive framework that generates concealed jailbreak prompts by creating semantically relevant queries and incorporating toxic knowledge.

Result: RTS-Attack effectively bypasses the alignment defenses of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro) and shows superior performance compared to baseline methods across diverse metrics such as universality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical gap in LLM alignment defenses and achieves improved concealment and universality of jailbreak prompts using RTS-Attack, urging future research in securing LLMs against such sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of a systematic evaluation of prompt injection attack detection methods for web agents.

Method: The study categorizes attacks, generates comprehensive datasets of both malicious and benign samples, and systematically tests text-based and image-based detection methods.

Result: Detection methods performed well for explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations but failed against more subtle and imperceptible attacks.

Conclusion: Current detection methods are insufficient for subtle prompt injection attacks, calling for enhanced solutions. Datasets and code are made public for future research.

the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

### [521] [ZK-WAGON: Imperceptible Watermark for Image Generation Models using ZK-SNARKs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01967)
*Aadarsh Anantha Ramakrishnan,Shubham Agarwal,Selvanayagam S,Kunwar Singh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZK-WAGON, a novel zero-knowledge proof-based watermarking system for image generation models that ensures verifiable proof of origin without compromising sensitive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by growing concerns around the misuse of synthetic media as image generation models become powerful, raising risks like misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual property violations.

Method: The method involves using ZK-SNARKs for watermarking, employing SL-ZKCC to reduce proof generation time, and embedding proofs into images via LSB steganography. The approach works on both GAN and Diffusion models while being model-agnostic.

Result: The proposed system enables secure and trustworthy AI image generation by providing proof of image origin without degrading quality or requiring model internals.

Conclusion: ZK-WAGON offers an innovative, effective solution for watermarking image generation models, addressing critical challenges around authenticity and security in synthetic media.

Abstract: As image generation models grow increasingly powerful and accessible,
concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse of synthetic media have
become critical. The ability to generate lifelike images indistinguishable from
real ones introduces risks such as misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual
property violations. Traditional watermarking methods either degrade image
quality, are easily removed, or require access to confidential model internals
- making them unsuitable for secure and scalable deployment. We are the first
to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models
using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge
(ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing
model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We
propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively
convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof
generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly
embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a
secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.

### [522] [Breaking the Code: Security Assessment of AI Code Agents Through Systematic Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01359)
*Shoumik Saha,Jifan Chen,Sam Mayers,Sanjay Krishna Gouda,Zijian Wang,Varun Kumar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces JAWS-BENCH, a benchmark to assess how code-capable LLMs handle safety-bypass jailbreak attacks, and uncovers vulnerabilities in their agent behavior during code execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about the efficacy of safety-bypass attacks on code-capable LLM agents, particularly their ability to execute malicious programs, which raises significant security concerns.

Method: JAWS-BENCH was developed with three workspace regimes (JAWS-0, JAWS-1, JAWS-M) and paired with the Judge Framework that evaluates compliance, attack success, syntactic correctness, and runtime executability using seven LLMs as backends.

Result: In JAWS-0, 61% of attacks are accepted. Compliance improves in JAWS-1 and JAWS-M, but attack success rate increases to ~75% with 32% of the malicious code directly executable. Vulnerability increases when LLMs are embedded in agents.

Conclusion: Execution-aware defenses, contextual safety filters, and mechanisms to preserve refusal decisions are vital to mitigate vulnerabilities disclosed by the benchmark's results.

Abstract: Code-capable large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly embedded into
software engineering workflows where they can read, write, and execute code,
raising the stakes of safety-bypass ("jailbreak") attacks beyond text-only
settings. Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection,
leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We
present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three
escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0),
single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a
hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii)
attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability,
moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five
families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code
agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27%
run end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~
100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the
multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly
deployable attack code. Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent
substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial
refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps.
Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and
most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps. These
findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and
mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step
reasoning and tool use.

### [523] [Position: Privacy Is Not Just Memorization!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01645)
*Niloofar Mireshghallah,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on training data memorization as the main privacy risk in LLMs, proposing a broader view of privacy risks throughout the LLM lifecycle and emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight that privacy risks in LLM systems go beyond training data memorization and to identify underexplored threats, aiming to improve how the research community addresses LLM privacy.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle and conducted a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers from 2016-2025 to evaluate research trends.

Result: The analysis shows that while training data memorization dominates privacy research, other critical privacy risks are underexplored, and existing frameworks do not adequately address them.

Conclusion: The paper calls for shifting the research focus toward interdisciplinary approaches to better tackle the broad spectrum of privacy threats associated with LLMs.

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines the intrinsic issues in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cyber threat intelligence (CTI), identifying three main vulnerabilities and proposing actionable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gaps and limitations of LLMs in supporting critical CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and incident response, which directly impact practical deployments.

Method: The authors conducted large-scale evaluations using diverse CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports. They employed a categorization methodology involving stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to analyze LLM performance.

Result: The study identified three fundamental vulnerabilities in LLMs: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, which affect their efficacy in CTI.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights into designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to address these vulnerabilities and serve as a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts
in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer
cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and
incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide
range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and
intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical
deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of
LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat
landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale
evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we
introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification,
autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably
analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections,
we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations,
contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in
effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for
designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

*Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-modal federated learning framework using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance security, interoperability, and scalability in healthcare systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of secure and standardized mechanisms for multi-modal data integration in existing federated learning frameworks for healthcare.

Method: Combines multi-modal feature alignment, differential privacy for secure data aggregation, and energy-aware scheduling, leveraging MCP as an interoperability layer for distributed AI systems.

Result: Achieved up to 9.8% better diagnostic accuracy, 54% lower client dropout rates, and maintained a favorable privacy-utility balance in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy approach for enabling next-generation federated healthcare systems with improved security, interoperability, and diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Secure and interoperable integration of heterogeneous medical data remains a
grand challenge in digital health. Current federated learning (FL) frameworks
offer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to
orchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained
environments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent
communication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed
architecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for
clinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii)
secure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive
updates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile
clients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables
adaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance
with privacy regulations. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets and
pilot clinical cohorts demonstrates up to 9.8\% improvement in diagnostic
accuracy compared with baseline FL, a 54\% reduction in client dropout rates,
and clinically acceptable privacy--utility trade-offs. These results highlight
MCP-enabled multi-modal fusion as a scalable and trustworthy pathway toward
equitable, next-generation federated health infrastructures.

*Milad Nasr,Yanick Fratantonio,Luca Invernizzi,Ange Albertini,Loua Farah,Alex Petit-Bianco,Andreas Terzis,Kurt Thomas,Elie Bursztein,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks on Gmail's ML-based malware detection system can significantly degrade detection. Researchers proposed defenses, reducing attack success and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore vulnerabilities in ML-powered production systems, particularly focusing on Gmail's malware detection system, and to assess the real-world impact of adversarial attacks on such systems.

Method: The study investigates adversarial attacks on Gmail's malware detection pipeline, specifically targeting its ML component named Magika. Researchers created adversarial examples by altering malware samples to fool Magika into routing files incorrectly.

Result: The study found that by changing just 13 bytes in a malware sample, attackers could evade Magika in 90% of cases and bypass the malware detection system. After implementing enhanced defenses, only 20% success rate was achieved even by adversaries altering 50 bytes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adversarial attacks present significant risks to production systems, but these can be mitigated effectively by implementing defenses like those developed in the study, which have already been integrated into Gmail's classifier.

Abstract: As deep learning models become widely deployed as components within larger
production systems, their individual shortcomings can create system-level
vulnerabilities with real-world impact. This paper studies how adversarial
attacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire
production-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of
Gmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model.
  The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning
model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware
classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has
been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can
cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an
unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection.
Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can
successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware
files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an
approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended
production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve
just a 20% attack success rate. We implement this defense, and, thanks to a
collaboration with Google engineers, it has already been deployed in production
for the Gmail classifier.

*Cristian Bassotto,Ermes Franch,Marina Krček,Stjepan Picek*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoMod ML-Attack, a cryptanalytic method designed to counter post-quantum security schemes by exploiting robust statistical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing poses a potential threat to classical cryptographic systems, prompting the need for robust post-quantum cryptographic methods, which the paper aims to evaluate and counter.

Method: The study employs a hybrid white-box cryptanalytic method involving optimized lattice preprocessing combined with statistical estimators to overcome modular reduction challenges.

Result: Experiments demonstrate NoMod's effectiveness in recovering binary secrets for specific dimensions and successfully tackling CRYSTALS-Kyber settings.

Conclusion: NoMod ML-Attack proves to be an effective approach in challenging post-quantum security schemes, revealing vulnerabilities in certain cryptographic parameters.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens classical public-key cryptography,
motivating NIST's adoption of post-quantum schemes such as those based on the
Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem. We present NoMod ML-Attack, a
hybrid white-box cryptanalytic method that circumvents the challenge of
modeling modular reduction by treating wrap-arounds as statistical corruption
and casting secret recovery as robust linear estimation. Our approach combines
optimized lattice preprocessing--including reduced-vector saving and algebraic
amplification--with robust estimators trained via Tukey's Biweight loss.
Experiments show NoMod achieves full recovery of binary secrets for dimension
$n = 350$, recovery of sparse binomial secrets for $n = 256$, and successful
recovery of sparse secrets in CRYSTALS-Kyber settings with parameters $(n, k) =
(128, 3)$ and $(256, 2)$. We release our implementation in an anonymous
repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NoMod-3BD4.

*Avinash Kumar Singh,Bhaskarjit Sarmah,Stefano Pasquali*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces FINCH, a dataset specifically designed for financial Text-to-SQL tasks, and benchmarks different reasoning and language models using it, with the addition of a new evaluation metric called FINCH Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of a large-scale financial dataset for Text-to-SQL applications, which presents unique challenges due to the complex schema and high-stakes errors associated with the financial domain.

Method: Researchers created the FINCH dataset with 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL pairs. They analyzed and benchmarked various models for their performance on financial Text-to-SQL tasks and introduced the FINCH Score evaluation metric.

Result: The authors showcased a systematic analysis of model strengths and limitations using the FINCH dataset, contributing important insights into the financial domain's Text-to-SQL challenges.

Conclusion: The FINCH dataset and FINCH Score provide critical tools for advancing research in financial Text-to-SQL applications, addressing existing gaps and paving the way for more reliable and domain-specific machine learning solutions.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has long been a central challenge in NLP. While progress has been
significant, applying it to the financial domain remains especially difficult
due to complex schema, domain-specific terminology, and high stakes of error.
Despite this, there is no dedicated large-scale financial dataset to advance
research, creating a critical gap. To address this, we introduce a curated
financial dataset (FINCH) comprising 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL
pairs, enabling both fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation. Building on this
resource, we benchmark reasoning models and language models of varying scales,
providing a systematic analysis of their strengths and limitations in financial
Text-to-SQL tasks. Finally, we propose a finance-oriented evaluation metric
(FINCH Score) that captures nuances overlooked by existing measures, offering a
more faithful assessment of model performance.

*Buxin Su,Natalie Collina,Garrett Wen,Didong Li,Kyunghyun Cho,Jianqing Fan,Bingxin Zhao,Weijie Su*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper explores how authors' self-ranking of their conference submissions can serve as a reliable tool for identifying high-impact research in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in submissions in fast-evolving fields like AI has made it increasingly challenging for peer reviews to identify high-impact research. Authors' own understanding of their work's depth and potential could help address this issue.

Method: The authors conducted a large-scale experiment where 1,342 researchers self-ranked their 2,592 submissions to a leading AI conference. They tracked citation outcomes for over a year and controlled for confounding factors such as preprint posting time and self-citations.

Result: The papers ranked highest by authors received twice as many citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts. Self-ranking was superior to peer review scores in predicting future citation counts, offering robust results even after accounting for confounders.

Conclusion: Authors' self-rankings are a reliable and valuable complement to peer review, potentially enhancing the identification and elevation of impactful research in the AI field.

Abstract: Peer review in academic research aims not only to ensure factual correctness
but also to identify work of high scientific potential that can shape future
research directions. This task is especially critical in fast-moving fields
such as artificial intelligence (AI), yet it has become increasingly difficult
given the rapid growth of submissions. In this paper, we investigate an
underexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own
rankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in
game-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative
because authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth
and long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale
experiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked
their 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than
a year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as
many citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were
especially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150
citations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review
scores in predicting future citation counts. Our results remained robust after
accounting for confounders such as preprint posting time and self-citations.
Together, these findings demonstrate that authors' self-rankings provide a
reliable and valuable complement to peer review for identifying and elevating
high-impact research in AI.

*Saranya Ganesh S.,Frederick Iat-Hin Tam,Milton S. Gomez,Marie McGraw,Mark DeMaria,Kate Musgrave,Jakob Runge,Tom Beucler*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study develops a causal discovery framework to improve Atlantic hurricane intensity predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods for short- and long-term forecast lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify limitations in current hurricane intensity forecasting methods due to complex interactions, confounding variables, and lack of generalizability. They aim to address these issues by leveraging causal relationships instead of correlations.

Method: They utilized a causal discovery framework with replicated datasets based on the SHIPS model and ERA5 reanalysis. Experiments were conducted to select causal predictors impacting hurricane intensity changes, followed by comparisons of models with different feature selection methods (e.g., causal, correlation, random forest importance).

Result: Causal feature selection improved short-term forecasts (1-3 days) significantly and contributed to increased predictive skill with SHIPS+ (an extended predictor set). Adding nonlinearity with multilayer perceptron models enhanced long-term forecasts.

Conclusion: Causal discovery approaches enhance hurricane intensity prediction by highlighting underutilized but physically significant predictors. Operational testing revealed notable improvements, paving the way for empirical and more reliable forecasts.

Abstract: Improving statistical forecasts of Atlantic hurricane intensity is limited by
complex nonlinear interactions and difficulty in identifying relevant
predictors. Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often
overlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen
tropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery
framework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity
Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct
multiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to
hurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to
compare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random
forest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24
to 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test
cases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features
primarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and
surface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often
underutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended
predictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS
predictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times
of 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron
further extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely
regional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests
confirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve
forecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate
that causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way
toward more empirical forecasts.

### [531] [Better Than "Better Than Nothing": Design Strategies for Enculturated Empathetic AI Robot Companions for Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01192)
*Isabel Pedersen,Andrea Slane*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the importance of incorporating empathetic interactions in human-robot designs for older adults, highlighting current design gaps and advocating for improved empathy-driven frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the identified shortcomings in human-robot interactions for older adults, particularly the lack of empathetic quality in social aspects of care robots.

Method: The paper employs rhetorical theory to understand socio-cultural expectations for empathy and analyzes public research collections focusing on robots, especially targeting gerontechnology.

Result: It identifies a neglect of empathy-based designs in public materials produced by robot companies and emphasizes the need for an empathetic care vocabulary in future designs.

Conclusion: Integrating affective AI with genuine cultural values of empathy can improve human-socially assistive robot interactions for older adults, thereby enhancing aging-in-place goals.

Abstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key
component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot
interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study
participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care
scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect.
Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as
a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the
socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It
analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates
empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein
empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections
on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it
substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by
robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary
as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing
humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of
aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the
sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought
to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving
empathetic qualities.

TL;DR: This paper combines immersive roleplaying games and Large Language Model (LLM) analysis to study user moral decision-making in digital privacy scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture users' moral preferences in rich, narrative-driven contexts and enhance understanding of decision-making processes for ethical software development.

Method: Participants engaged in roleplaying games with ethically charged scenarios. Data collected was interpreted using a customized LLM called "GPT Anthropologist," and evaluated through cross-validation.

Result: Evaluation demonstrated improved data richness and interpretive framing, enabling better prediction of user moral behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively utilized to automate and improve the understanding of user moral preferences, aiding ethical design in software development.

Abstract: This study investigates a novel approach to eliciting users' moral
decision-making by combining immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis
capabilities. Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard
ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding
individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we
focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven
interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game
exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital
privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized
LLM ("GPT Anthropologist"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows
that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly
enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs
can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user
moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software
development.

TL;DR: LegiScout is a visualization system for better understanding complex legislative frameworks like the ACA, using dynamic graphs rather than static diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern legislative frameworks, such as the ACA, creates challenges in interpreting static policy charts, even for experts.

Method: LegiScout transforms static diagrams into dynamic, force-directed graphs using techniques like data extraction, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Result: LegiScout allows users to better comprehend and explore legislative and regulatory frameworks by enabling enhanced visualization.

Conclusion: The interactive system improves policy comprehension for various stakeholders like policymakers, analysts, and the public.

Abstract: Modern legislative frameworks, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often
involve complex webs of agencies, mandates, and interdependencies. Government
issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static,
dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout,
an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into
dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving
essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language
processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper
exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and
regulatory frameworks. Our approach enables stakeholders - policymakers,
analysts, and the public - to navigate and understand the complexity inherent
in modern law.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-in-the-loop AI system to assist midwives in capturing relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols via low-cost ultrasound devices, showing promising results in usability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access to obstetric ultrasound in rural and underserved areas of low- and middle-income countries is limited, prompting the need for a scalable solution that midwives can use effectively.

Method: The system combines AI-based classification models with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. Non-expert midwives used low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound devices to gather sweep videos, which were then analyzed using the AI system.

Result: The AI system successfully identified standard fetal planes from midwives' blind sweeps, showing good usability and low cognitive workload during field evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed AI system demonstrates potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in low-resource regions, reducing reliance on specialists and enabling effective image acquisition by non-experts.

Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings,
particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work
proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to
assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind
sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a
web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key
frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate
on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its
performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained
midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were
analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard
fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good
usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to
expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

TL;DR: GUIde is an AI-based system that generates graphical interfaces for command-line tools by translating their man page documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the use of command-line tools by combining their power with the discoverability of graphical interfaces.

Method: AI translates command-line documentation (man pages) into graphical interface specifications, which GUIde uses to create user-friendly GUIs.

Result: GUIde effectively generates graphical interfaces for a range of command-line tools, improving usability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: GUIde bridges the gap between text-based and graphical systems, enhancing accessibility to command-line power for users.

Abstract: Although birthed in the era of teletypes, the command line shell survived the
graphical interface revolution of the 1980's and lives on in modern desktop
operating systems. The command line provides access to powerful functionality
not otherwise exposed on the computer, but requires users to recall textual
syntax and carefully scour documentation. In contrast, graphical interfaces let
users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and
menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a
mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line
tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into
interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing
system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We
evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what
degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command
line tasks.

### [536] [From keywords to semantics: Perceptions of large language models in data discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01473)
*Maura E Halstead,Mark A. Green,Caroline Jay,Richard Kingston,David Topping,Alexander Singleton*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores researchers' perspectives on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for data discovery, highlighting barriers and transparency features that could increase acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current keyword-based data discovery processes are challenging and could miss relevant data. The paper aims to explore whether LLMs, which allow natural language queries, would be accepted by researchers for this purpose.

Method: A human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) approach was used, involving focus groups (N = 27) to assess researchers' attitudes towards adopting LLMs for data discovery.

Result: The researchers found that while LLMs exhibit potential benefits, these are not enough for widespread acceptance due to barriers. Transparency features could help overcome those barriers.

Conclusion: Developers should leverage the conceptual model presented in the paper to include transparency features that may enhance researchers' acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.

Abstract: Current approaches to data discovery match keywords between metadata and
queries. This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that
other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could
lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data
discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask
questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if
researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered
artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to
understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our
conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for
researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent
researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could
overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features
that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.

### [537] [Towards Human-Centered RegTech: Unpacking Professionals' Strategies and Needs for Using LLMs Safely](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01638)
*Siying Hu,Yaxing Yao,Zhicong Lu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies how Large Language Models affect the work patterns of professionals in high-risk domains, revealing compliance concerns and limited mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professionals in law, healthcare, and finance face compliance challenges while using Large Language Models, prompting a need to explore their risks and usage strategies.

Method: Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 highly-skilled knowledge workers across various industries.

Result: The study identified concerns like sensitive information leakage, intellectual property risks, and low confidence in model outputs. Experts use informal mitigation strategies, but these are largely ineffective due to a lack of guidance.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need for Human-Centered, Compliance-Driven NLP systems tailored to regulatory workflows, addressing gaps between existing tools and professional needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models are profoundly changing work patterns in high-risk
professional domains, yet their application also introduces severe and
underexplored compliance risks. To investigate this issue, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with 24 highly-skilled knowledge workers from
industries such as law, healthcare, and finance. The study found that these
experts are commonly concerned about sensitive information leakage,
intellectual property infringement, and uncertainty regarding the quality of
model outputs. In response, they spontaneously adopt various mitigation
strategies, such as actively distorting input data and limiting the details in
their prompts. However, the effectiveness of these spontaneous efforts is
limited due to a lack of specific compliance guidance and training for Large
Language Models. Our research reveals a significant gap between current NLP
tools and the actual compliance needs of experts. This paper positions these
valuable empirical findings as foundational work for building the next
generation of Human-Centered, Compliance-Driven Natural Language Processing for
Regulatory Technology (RegTech), providing a critical human-centered
perspective and design requirements for engineering NLP systems that can
proactively support expert compliance workflows.

### [538] [Human-Robo-advisor collaboration in decision-making: Evidence from a multiphase mixed methods experimental study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02153)
*Hasan Mahmud,Najmul Islam,Satish Krishnan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Robo-advisors (RAs) are effective alternatives to human financial advisors, but adoption remains limited. This study explores how users interpret their roles and integrate their advice into decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limited adoption of robo-advisors despite their advantages over human advisors, and to explore how users interpret their roles and advice.

Method: A mixed methods approach combining a behavioral experiment with 334 participants, thematic analysis, and follow-up quantitative testing.

Result: People tend to rely on RAs, influenced by performance information and advice framing. Three RA roles and four user types were identified, alongside a 2x2 typology of acceptance factors.

Conclusion: The study enhances comprehension of human-RAs collaboration, offering actionable recommendations for designing trustworthy and adaptive robo-advisors.

Abstract: Robo-advisors (RAs) are cost-effective, bias-resistant alternatives to human
financial advisors, yet adoption remains limited. While prior research has
examined user interactions with RAs, less is known about how individuals
interpret RA roles and integrate their advice into decision-making. To address
this gap, this study employs a multiphase mixed methods design integrating a
behavioral experiment (N = 334), thematic analysis, and follow-up quantitative
testing. Findings suggest that people tend to rely on RAs, with reliance shaped
by information about RA performance and the framing of advice as gains or
losses. Thematic analysis reveals three RA roles in decision-making and four
user types, each reflecting distinct patterns of advice integration. In
addition, a 2 x 2 typology categorizes antecedents of acceptance into enablers
and inhibitors at both the individual and algorithmic levels. By combining
behavioral, interpretive, and confirmatory evidence, this study advances
understanding of human-RA collaboration and provides actionable insights for
designing more trustworthy and adaptive RA systems.

### [539] [EvolveCaptions: Empowering DHH Users Through Real-Time Collaborative Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02181)
*Liang-Yuan Wu,Dhruv Jain*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: EvolveCaptions improves ASR for DHH speakers by enabling hearing participants to correct errors in real-time and fine-tune the system quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems face challenges in accurately recognizing speech from DHH individuals, especially during live conversations, limiting accessibility.

Method: The system uses collaborative error correction from hearing participants to generate speech prompts for DHH individuals to record, enabling real-time ASR fine-tuning.

Result: In tests, EvolveCaptions reduced WER for DHH users within one hour, requiring only 5 minutes of recording per person.

Conclusion: Collaborative, minimal-effort ASR adaptation improves accessibility and communication for DHH users, highlighting its practical viability.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately
transcribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially
during real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically
require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the
DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR
adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort.
Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on
these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts
for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model.
In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced
Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only
five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as
intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings
demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more
equitable communication.
