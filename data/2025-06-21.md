### [1] [CALM: Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14936)
*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks to enable context-sensitive and multimodal decision-making, achieving higher accuracy in tasks like object placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic bivalent logic fails to address nuanced, multimodal decision-making, while neural networks lack interpretable reasoning. CALM aims to integrate both approaches.

Method: CALM uses neural networks to refine analog truth values of symbolic predicates through a domain tree, with iterative refinement and constraint satisfaction via symbolic reasoning.

Result: CALM outperformed classical logic (86.3%) and LLM baselines (59.4%) with a 92.2% accuracy in object placement tasks, and generated spatial heatmaps aligned with logical constraints and human preferences.

Conclusion: CALM proves effective in combining logic-based reasoning with neural multimodal understanding, setting a framework for advanced AI capable of precise, interpretable, and context-sensitive reasoning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

### [2] [MEAL: A Benchmark for Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14990)
*Tristan Tomilin,Luka van den Boogaard,Samuel Garcin,Bram Grooten,Meng Fang,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEAL, a benchmark designed to advance continual learning in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, with GPU acceleration enabling efficient long task sequence handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks in continual learning for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning and overcome computational limitations in current CL benchmarks using CPUs.

Method: MEAL utilizes JAX for GPU acceleration to run sequences of tasks efficiently and investigates the performance and scalability of combining popular CL and MARL methods.

Result: MEAL allows execution of task sequences up to 100 tasks in just hours on standard desktop PCs. It uncovered scalability limitations in naive combinations of CL and MARL methods in complex tasks.

Conclusion: Architectural and algorithmic considerations are key for effective continual multi-agent reinforcement learning, and MEAL provides a foundation for exploring this space.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

### [3] [Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15050)
*Tiantian Fan,Lingjun Liu,Yu Yue,Jiaze Chen,Chengyi Wang,Qiying Yu,Chi Zhang,Zhiqi Lin,Ruofei Zhu,Yufeng Yuan,Xiaochen Zuo,Bole Ma,Mofan Zhang,Gaohong Liu,Ru Zhang,Haotian Zhou,Cong Xie,Ruidong Zhu,Zhi Zhang,Xin Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Lin Yan,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-PPO, an enhancement to Proximal Policy Optimization, optimizing training efficiency for reasoning LLMs by reducing redundant computations using novel mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in training large language models for long Chains-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through conventional PPO methods.

Method: The authors propose T-PPO, integrating Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation and a mechanism for independent policy and value optimization, mitigating idle computing periods during long-generation processes.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that T-PPO improves training efficiency for reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms competitors.

Conclusion: T-PPO represents a significant improvement in training efficiency and performance, advancing scalable reasoning capabilities for LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

### [4] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang,Ling Zhang,Haolong Qian,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix, a hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs, evolves and selects heuristics dynamically to tackle combinatorial optimization problems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs for combinatorial optimization problems rely heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across instances.

Method: HeurAgenix uses a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework that evolves heuristics with LLMs and dynamically selects suitable ones using either a state-of-the-art or lightweight model.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or surpasses specialized solvers.

Conclusion: The framework proves its capability to adapt, learn, and solve diverse CO problems while achieving high performance with efficient supervision strategies.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [5] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady,Siyi Hu,Mahardhika Pratama,Jimmy Cao,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses autonomous coordination challenges in multi-satellite systems by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Earth Observation (EO) mission planning. It evaluates various MARL algorithms within a simulation environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are essential for addressing global issues like climate monitoring and disaster management, but autonomous multi-satellite coordination remains a critical challenge.

Method: The authors model single- and multi-satellite operations using RL and MARL frameworks and evaluate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms (PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO) in a realistic satellite simulation environment.

Result: Results show that MARL algorithms effectively balance imaging and resource management while managing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that MARL-based approaches are promising for enhancing autonomous operations in decentralised multi-satellite Earth Observation missions, offering guidelines for policy learning improvements.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

### [6] [Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225)
*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses MIoT’s rising computational demand through a cooperative MEC framework using UAVs and vessels to optimize computation offloading and resource allocation, solving challenges caused by uncertain tasks with Lyapunov optimization and Markov game techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in computational demands from MIoT and challenges with inefficient resource allocation and offloading under task uncertainty prompted the authors to explore solutions.

Method: The study proposed a cooperative MEC framework involving UAVs, vessels, and MIoT devices, formulated optimization problems using Lyapunov optimization for uncertain tasks, introduced Markov game reformulation, and developed a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods effectively addressed computational offloading and resource allocation issues under task uncertainty in MIoT, validated through simulations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed cooperative MEC framework and optimization approach significantly improve performance for MIoT computation under uncertain task conditions.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

### [7] [Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377)
*Ruoyu Wang,Xinshu Li,Chen Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Causal Understanding Module for Visual Navigation tasks to improve agent performance by addressing limitations of conventional sequential data processing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Navigation tasks in Embodied AI require efficient processing of sequential observational data, but existing methods fail to exploit the internal association structure within the data, limiting task performance.

Method: A causal framework is introduced, accompanied by a novel Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN) method that integrates a Causal Understanding Module.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed CAN approach surpasses baseline methods across diverse tasks and simulation environments, supported by extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The Causal Understanding Module enhances environmental understanding effectively, achieving improved performance without added computational overhead in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Large Language Model-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist failure analysis by integrating planning capabilities and external tools to automate tasks and improve workflow efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient orchestration of multiple AI components in failure analysis workflows, which currently rely on intricate and time-intensive manual processes.

Method: The paper presents the design and implementation of the LPA, which combines large language models with advanced planning and external tool interaction to process complex tasks autonomously.

Result: The evaluation shows that the LPA improves operational effectiveness and reliability in automating challenging aspects of failure analysis.

Conclusion: The LPA demonstrates significant potential in assisting failure analysis engineers by streamlining tasks and seamlessly integrating with the FA process, suggesting a promising future for AI-driven automation in this field.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [9] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for better natural language 'state' representations to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in repeated multi-agent games and explores how different encodings affect agent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods of encoding game history for LLMs in multi-agent games were ad hoc, making behavior analysis and comparability difficult. The authors aim to provide a systematic approach for constructing state representations.

Method: The authors propose a framework with three axes to evaluate state representations: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and natural language compression. They test their framework on a dynamic selfish routing game to observe behavioral dependencies.

Result: They find that summarized state representations with regret-focused expressions and limited details of others' actions align better with game-theoretic equilibria and ensure more stable gameplay. Other representations lead to significant deviations from equilibrium or unstable behaviors.

Conclusion: A structured approach to designing state representations for LLMs can significantly influence agent performance in repeated games, with specific design choices enhancing adherence to theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

### [10] [The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639)
*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights the development and evaluation of an AI Policy Module for computer science students to address gaps in AI ethics and policy education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing integration of AI in personal and professional settings demands a curriculum shift to teach students about AI ethics, policies, and the translation of abstract principles into practical design choices.

Method: The paper develops and refines an AI Policy Module, including the addition of a technical 'AI regulation' assignment, and measures student outcomes via pre- and post-module surveys.

Result: After completing the module, students showed increased ethical concern about AI systems and greater confidence in engaging with AI policy and regulatory discussions.

Conclusion: Incorporating AI policy discussions and practical assignments in computer science curriculum is effective in preparing future AI practitioners to address ethical and policy challenges.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

### [11] [Exploring and Exploiting the Inherent Efficiency within Large Reasoning Models for Self-Guided Efficiency Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15647)
*Weixiang Zhao,Jiahe Guo,Yang Deng,Xingyu Sui,Yulin Hu,Yanyan Zhao,Wanxiang Che,Bing Qin,Tat-Seng Chua,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study addresses inefficiencies in large reasoning models (LRMs) such as overthinking by introducing two lightweight methods to reduce reasoning length without sacrificing task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models often display inefficiency due to generating unnecessarily verbose content, inflating processing costs.

Method: Two methods: Efficiency Steering—a training-free activation steering technique to direct the model behavior, and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL—a reinforcement learning framework incentivizing concise reasoning.

Result: The proposed techniques significantly reduce reasoning length across multiple benchmarks and maintain or improve overall task performance.

Conclusion: LRMs' efficiency can be enhanced by leveraging their inherent capabilities, reducing reasoning verbosity while maintaining accuracy through representation-focused techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

*Yao Zhang,Chenyang Lin,Shijie Tang,Haokun Chen,Shijie Zhou,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SwarmAgentic, a fully automated framework for creating autonomous agentic systems from scratch, which outperforms baselines in exploratory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for agentic systems lack the ability to generate agents autonomously from scratch, optimize functionality collaboratively, and adapt to new situations efficiently, limiting their scalability.

Method: SwarmAgentic uses a population-based system inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), where agent functionality and collaboration are optimized simultaneously through a feedback-driven search process.

Result: SwarmAgentic achieves significant improvements in exploratory, real-world tasks, including a 261.8% improvement over the ADAS model in a high-level planning benchmark.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic combines swarm intelligence with full automation to advance scalable and autonomous agentic systems, proving superior in structurally unconstrained tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

*Yining Hong,Rui Sun,Bingxuan Li,Xingcheng Yao,Maxine Wu,Alexander Chien,Da Yin,Ying Nian Wu,Zhecan James Wang,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Embodied Web Agents, AI capable of integrating physical and digital intelligence for tasks like cooking from online recipes or navigating with maps. It develops a simulation platform and benchmark to facilitate this research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current AI agents are siloed, either excelling in digital information retrieval and reasoning or interacting with the physical environment, but not both simultaneously. This limitation hinders the ability to solve tasks requiring integration of physical and digital intelligence.

Method: The authors developed Embodied Web Agents task environments, a platform combining realistic 3D indoor and outdoor settings with functional web interfaces. They also created a benchmark featuring tasks like cooking, navigation, and shopping to test cross-domain intelligence.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art AI significantly lags behind human performance in tasks requiring cross-domain reasoning, highlighting the challenges and potential research opportunities in this area.

Conclusion: The proposed Embodied Web Agents platform and benchmark pave the way for advancing AI that seamlessly integrates physical embodiment with web-scale reasoning. This work underscores the gap in current AI capabilities, encouraging further research.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Conclusion: The work provides practical guidelines and validated performance tools to aid the development of AI infrastructures capable of supporting next-generation LLMs.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization
complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

Conclusion: ChatModel demonstrates considerable potential in automating and improving the efficiency and quality of reference model generation and verification, addressing key challenges in integrated circuit design.

Abstract: As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the
functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models,
critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming
more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by
large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating
complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these

generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from
design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating
design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a
building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design
capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts
verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying
complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and
quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance
improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable
enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its
capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the
iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of
5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential
of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model
generation and validation.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents a self-calibrated mixed-signal Compute-In-Memory (CIM) accelerator, addressing integration and reliability challenges in AI hardware by combining SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation and automated on-chip calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome integration and reliability challenges in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures, particularly for accelerating AI tasks like Deep Neural Networks.

Method: The proposed approach involves designing a mixed-signal CIM accelerator using SRAM-based weight storage, linear multi-bit computation, and incorporating a RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration system in a 22-nm FDSOI technology.

Result: The solution improved the compute SNR by 25-45% (up to 18-24 dB) and demonstrated scalability of the architecture with high-density linear resistor technologies for enhanced performance.

Conclusion: This work successfully addresses the integration and reliability concerns of CIM systems and lays a foundation for better-performing and more scalable AI acceleration architectures.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is
becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks
on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there
has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures
aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle
the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal
CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory
(eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several
integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption
into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and
eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize
end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still
more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of
reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to
computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two
challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC,
fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the
CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage
with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source
programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability
are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration,
allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to
reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our
proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor
technologies for enhanced computing performance.

*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents a unique manually annotated dataset for extracting Adverse Events (AEs) from elderly discharge summaries, highlighting challenges in capturing nuanced clinical language and underrepresented AEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elderly patients are often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources, necessitating improved methods to accurately extract and study Adverse Events (AEs) in this demographic.

Method: The researchers developed a manually annotated corpus with 14 significant AEs and contextual attributes to support discontinuous and overlapping entities. They tested multiple models, including transformer-based architectures like BERT, across different annotation granularities.

Result: Transformer-based models performed well for document-level coarse-grained tasks (F1 = 0.943) but struggled with fine-grained entity-level tasks (F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a robust resource for AE extraction, though challenges remain in detecting nuanced and underrepresented clinical elements. It is available for further research and cross-dataset generalisation studies.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding phases, leveraging complementary errors to enhance prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of low-quality output during constrained decoding of structured NLP tasks while allowing dynamic constraints without retraining.

Method: BoostCD involves two phases: first obtaining weak predictions via constrained and unconstrained decoding, then combining them using a boosted autoregressive model to exploit complementary errors.

Result: BoostCD demonstrated superior performance in closed information extraction tasks both in and out of distribution, correcting common errors observed in earlier approaches.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively enhances structured NLP task performance, showing that complementarity between constrained and unconstrained errors can be leveraged for improved predictions.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrEst, a weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents in large language models, achieving significant accuracy and F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing the credibility of context documents during the inference phase of large language models, especially to mitigate propagation of unreliable information.

Method: CrEst evaluates credibility through semantic coherence among credible documents using inter-document agreement. Two strategies are proposed: (1) a black-box approach for LLMs without weight/access information, and (2) a white-box method modifying attention mechanisms.

Result: CrEst demonstrated up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score across various architectures and datasets. It also maintained robust performance under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Incorporating credibility assessment into LLM inference enhances performance, reliability, and robustness, positioning CrEst as an effective solution to the challenge of evaluating context document credibility.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBench, a new dataset designed for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on multi-document reasoning tasks, created via a synthetic generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks that rigorously evaluate the multi-document reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and overcome the historical difficulty and cost of annotating long inputs.

Method: The authors developed MDBench using a novel synthetic generation technique. This method uses structured seed knowledge and employs LLM-assisted edits to create reasoning challenges, which are then transformed into natural language text to form multi-document sets and corresponding question-answer examples.

Result: MDBench reveals significant challenges for existing LLMs and prompting techniques, even with shorter document sets. It also enables targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning abilities and can quickly adapt to new challenges or model improvements.

Conclusion: MDBench effectively fills a significant gap in multi-document reasoning evaluation and provides a flexible and scalable approach to benchmark future advancements in LLMs.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B for diabetes prediction using few-shot prompting, comparing them against traditional ML models and other open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of using LLMs, which are typically trained on unstructured text data, for structured numerical data tasks such as diabetes prediction.

Method: The study employed zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting techniques on six LLMs alongside traditional ML models. These models were tested on the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD) and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B outperformed open-source LLMs and, in some cases, traditional ML models like Random Forest and SVM, particularly with few-shot prompting.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in medical prediction tasks, but issues like prompt variability and lack of domain-specific fine-tuning remain. Future research should explore prompt engineering and hybrid approaches.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate reversible sentence embeddings, allowing exact reconstruction of the original text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether LLMs can perform exact text reconstruction from specialized embeddings, which has implications for applications like memory-based retrieval and text compression.

Method: A special memory token and optimized embedding are introduced to train the model to reconstruct the original text without altering the model's weights.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLMs, including models as large as Llama 3.1 8B, can reconstruct sequences of up to 240 tokens accurately in English and Spanish.

Conclusion: This study uncovers a novel capability of LLMs and opens avenues for leveraging reversible sentence embeddings in tasks requiring precise text reconstruction.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Result: High-quality classifiers were developed (average F1: 0.86, accuracy: 0.82). Analysis of over 300,000 suicides (2002–2020) identified 1,198 cases mentioning chronic social isolation, with certain groups like men, gay individuals, and divorced individuals having higher odds.

Conclusion: The developed methods enhance the surveillance and understanding of social isolation and loneliness as factors contributing to suicides, and these insights could inform prevention efforts in the United States.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrefBERT, a scoring model for assessing open-ended long-form text generation and guiding RL training with improved reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for long-form generation fail to comprehensively assess key aspects like coherence, style, and relevance, creating a need for better scoring models.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse datasets with Likert-rated quality, and it supports GRPO training by providing semantic reward signals superior to traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore.

Result: PrefBERT demonstrates reliability across varied long text passages and yields outputs more aligned with human preferences when used for RL training compared to traditional metrics.

Conclusion: PrefBERT enhances long-form text generation by providing better evaluation metrics and reward signals, offering a more effective alternative for RL training.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [29] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how the process of encoding knowledge during training impacts the effectiveness of post-hoc unlearning in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing deployment of LLMs in real-world applications has created the need for efficient ways to remove specific knowledge (unlearning), driven by reasons like privacy regulations or correcting harmful/outdated content.

Method: The study empirically investigates the impact of learning-time knowledge encoding on unlearning performance, focusing on parameters like the use of paraphrased descriptions and examining challenges in unlearning specific knowledge from larger text chunks.

Result: The experiments reveal two key findings: (1) training with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning effectiveness, and (2) unlearning specific knowledge within a chunk of text remains challenging.

Conclusion: The encoding choices made during the training of LLMs may play a central role in enabling more reliable and effective post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving linguistic ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in dialogues caused by linguistic features such as omission and idioms obstruct accurate identification of discourse relations.

Method: The authors propose DCM for reasoning about ambiguous discourse relations and CPO for evaluating and optimizing the contributions of the clarifications made by DCM.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance over SOTA methods, resolving ambiguities as evidenced by experiments on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: By employing DCM and CPO, the paper provides a robust framework for addressing discourse relation ambiguities and improving dialogue discourse parsing.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CKD-EHR framework, which improves EHR-based disease prediction models using knowledge distillation to achieve high efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of insufficient medical knowledge representation and low efficiency in clinical deployment for large language models in EHR-based disease prediction.

Method: The CKD-EHR framework fine-tunes the Qwen2.5-7B large language model on enhanced medical datasets, uses a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism to produce interpretable soft labels, and distills knowledge into a lightweight BERT model.

Result: On the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR improves diagnostic accuracy by 9%, increases the F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2 times speedup in inference compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The utilization of CKD-EHR enhances resource efficiency while significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and speed, making it valuable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [32] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduced a two-stage approach for open-domain dialogue systems to enhance response diversity and quality using a new dialogue corpus and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-domain dialogues often require diverse and contextually valid responses, but existing models do not adequately handle this one-to-many property.

Method: The proposed method decomposes response generation into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), aided by a specialized dialogue corpus called o2mDial and novel tuning strategies.

Result: The two-stage framework improves response diversity and contextual coherence, demonstrating up to a 90% improvement in response quality for smaller models, nearing the performance of larger models.

Conclusion: Incorporating the one-to-many property into dialogue models enhances diversity and quality, offering a viable path for improving smaller LLM performance in open-domain dialogue tasks.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Thunder-Tok, a Korean tokenizer that reduces token count (fertility) by 10% while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers have high token fertility, leading to inefficiency, particularly for Korean, which has a linguistic structure unsuitable for traditional methods like BPE.

Method: Thunder-Tok employs rule-based pre-tokenization tailored to Korean linguistics, a seed vocabulary of linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Achieved approximately 10% reduction in token count, leading to 10% faster inference speeds without degrading performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok demonstrates the feasibility of a linguistically informed approach for creating efficient tokenizers for Korean language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [34] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how state-space language models like Mamba retain and forget information over time by examining U-shaped patterns in memory performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding memory mechanisms in language models aids in identifying how such models retain or forget information, which is crucial for improving their general-purpose utility.

Method: The authors use structured recall tasks on Mamba architectures to measure memory performance and analyze three mechanisms (long-term memory, short-term memory dynamics, and semantic regularity effects) that shape retention.

Result: The study identifies three key memory mechanisms: sparse channels for long-term primacy effects, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term recency effects, and dynamic adjustments in memory allocation depending on semantic patterns.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of memory dynamics in state-space language models and validate them with experiments on both smaller and larger Mamba models (1.4B and 7B parameters).

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates various large language models (LLMs) for single-label, multi-class text classification related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), finding that smaller models with prompt engineering can match the performance of larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and improve progress tracking toward the 17 SDGs by utilizing text classification models to handle the extensive and complex data associated.

Method: The study analyzes proprietary and open-source LLMs and tests task adaptation techniques such as Zero-Shot Learning, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning for SDG-related text classification.

Result: Smaller LLMs optimized using prompt engineering can rival the performance of larger models like OpenAI's GPT for SDG-related tasks.

Conclusion: Efficient use of smaller LLMs with prompt engineering provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for SDG text classification, reducing reliance on heavyweight models like GPT.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProtoReasoning, a framework using prototypical representations to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates significant performance gains and validates the role of reasoning prototypes in cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and improve cross-domain generalization in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by harnessing shared abstract reasoning prototypes that underlie diverse tasks.

Method: The method involves the development of ProtoReasoning, which includes an automated pipeline for transforming problems into reasoning prototypes, a verification system using Prolog/PDDL interpreters, and the ability to scale and synthesize problems within prototype space.

Result: ProtoReasoning improved performance across various benchmarks: 4.7% on logical reasoning, 6.3% on planning, 4.0% on general reasoning, and 1.0% on mathematics, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that reasoning prototypes can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities and generalization, reaffirming that shared reasoning structures underlie cross-domain tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-ended question answering in LLMs poses evaluation challenges; authors propose MinosEval, which better aligns with human understanding and offers interpretable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to effectively evaluate open-ended QA due to the demands for nuanced reasoning and diverse answer expressions.

Method: The paper introduces MinosEval, a system that tailors its evaluation strategies based on the nature of the question (factoid or non-factoid).

Result: MinosEval demonstrates superior alignment with human annotations and provides enriched interpretability across various open-ended QA datasets.

Conclusion: MinosEval is a robust tool for evaluating open-ended QA tasks, addressing shortcomings of current metrics and methods.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how well current language technologies, including encoder-only and decoder-based models, handle Basque and Spanish language varieties using natural language inference (NLI). It finds a performance drop, especially in Basque due to dialect differences, with encoder-only models struggling the most with Western Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the capability of existing language technologies to process linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish, which remains an under-addressed area for diverse and region-specific languages.

Method: The study utilizes NLI as a central task and introduces a novel parallel dataset for Basque, Spanish, and their dialects. Crosslingual and in-context learning experiments are conducted on large language models, followed by ablation and error analyses.

Result: The results indicate a significant performance drop for models dealing with linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Encoder-only models have notable difficulties with Western Basque, supporting linguistic theory on its deviation from the standard.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that linguistic variation, particularly in peripheral dialects like Western Basque, poses a challenge for current language models. The research highlights the need to address such variation in language technology development. It also publicly shares the dataset and code for further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models when applied to historical text analysis, particularly within computational humanities and AIGC technology.

Method: The authors propose the Graph RAG framework, which incorporates chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision, complemented by a collaborative mechanism using knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation for alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B model achieved optimal performance in relation extraction (F1=0.68), while the DeepSeek model with GraphRAG significantly improved F1 scores (by 11%) over other models on an open-domain dataset, reducing hallucinations and improving interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel, low-resource approach to extracting historical knowledge, advancing text analysis and humanities research by bridging gaps in general language models.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Result: TopClustRAG achieved strong performance, ranking 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset leaderboard.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation are effective approaches for enhancing the performance of large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Thunder-DeID, a framework for anonymizing South Korean court judgments using deep learning, while aligning with legal standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inadequacies in the current de-identification process of South Korean court judgments, which cannot scale effectively nor handle vague personal identifier definitions.

Method: The authors build a legal dataset of annotated judgments, classify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) systematically, and develop a deep neural network-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The proposed deep learning model achieves state-of-the-art results in anonymizing the text of court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID provides a scalable and legally compliant solution for de-identifying court judgments, significantly improving anonymity handling.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

TL;DR: This survey examines the use of LLMs in clinical trial-patient matching, analyzing their potential, challenges, and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical trial-patient matching approaches are trial-specific, while LLMs could provide generalized solutions by leveraging their reasoning and knowledge aggregation capabilities.

Method: The study critically surveys recent methods, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks for trial-patient matching and highlights future research directions.

Result: The paper identifies limitations in existing benchmarks, proprietary models, and evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs hold significant promise for improving patient-trial matching, but challenges such as benchmark quality and proprietary constraints must be addressed.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

### [43] [ConLID: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Low-Resource Language Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15304)
*Negar Foroutan,Jakhongir Saydaliev,Ye Eun Kim,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in language identification (LID) for low-resource languages by proposing a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) method that improves performance by 3.2% on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods for training LID models struggle with low-resource languages due to dataset limitations and class imbalances, requiring domain-invariant representations to improve performance.

Method: The authors propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach aimed at developing domain-invariant representations to make LID models more effective for low-resource languages.

Result: The approach enhances LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages, achieving a 3.2% improvement.

Conclusion: Supervised contrastive learning is shown to be an effective solution for addressing LID class imbalance and improving performance for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

*Camila Zurdo Tagliabue,Heloisa Oss Boll,Aykut Erdem,Erkut Erdem,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a framework called DeVisE for evaluating clinical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using ICU discharge notes with controlled counterfactual scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve clinical decision support systems by distinguishing genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns in LLMs.

Method: The authors develop the DeVisE framework, using ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV to create datasets with controlled counterfactuals and evaluate LLMs based on input sensitivity and downstream reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot LLMs demonstrate coherent counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models are stable but less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly affect model outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing reveals critical insights into the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and underscores the necessity for fairness-aware and transparent medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

*Arijit Maji,Raghvendra Kumar,Akash Ghosh,Anushka,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SANSKRITI, the largest dataset designed to evaluate language models' understanding of India's cultural diversity, spanning 21,853 QA pairs from 28 states and 8 union territories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for language models to adapt to local socio-cultural contexts, particularly in India’s diverse cultural landscape.

Method: The researchers created SANSKRITI, a benchmark dataset covering 16 attributes of Indian culture. They then tested it on various models including large, Indic-specific, and small language models.

Result: The evaluation revealed that many language models struggle with culturally specific queries, lacking regional nuances.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI provides a rich dataset for better understanding and improving language models' comprehension of India's diverse cultural dynamics.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

### [46] [COSMMIC: Comment-Sensitive Multimodal Multilingual Indian Corpus for Summarization and Headline Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15372)
*Raghvendra Kumar,S. A. Mohammed Salman,Aryan Sahu,Tridib Nandi,Pragathi Y. P.,Sriparna Saha,Jose G. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The COSMMIC dataset introduces comment-sensitive multimodal and multilingual summarization for nine Indian languages, combining text, images, and user comments to improve natural language generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and research in Indian languages for multimodal and multilingual summarization, especially integrating user feedback.

Method: The paper introduces the COSMMIC dataset with article-image pairs, reader comments, multilingual summaries, and employs models such as GPT-4 and IndicBERT for different combinations of inputs like text, images, and comments.

Result: Extensive evaluation demonstrates insights in identifying supportive comments, classifying noise, and extracting valuable elements from images, advancing NLG capabilities for Indian languages.

Conclusion: The COSMMIC dataset fills gaps in NLP research for Indian languages by integrating multimodal inputs and improving summarization tasks, fostering inclusivity and resource development.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

### [47] [Targeted Lexical Injection: Unlocking Latent Cross-Lingual Alignment in Lugha-Llama via Early-Layer LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15415)
*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI) to improve lexical alignment for low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili) in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving a notable enhancement in Swahili-English word pair alignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to data limitations and weak cross-lingual lexical alignment. This research seeks to address these gaps and improve language representation for better natural language processing capabilities.

Method: Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI) leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune the model, focusing on embeddings from the optimal early layers identified through pilot studies.

Result: TLI improves Swahili-English word pair alignment significantly, yielding a 28% increase in cosine similarity for both trained and unseen word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI enables parameter-efficient enhancement of cross-lingual lexical alignment for low-resource languages, providing a novel approach to optimize LLMs for such underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving GUI agents driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by addressing their systematic localization errors through refined evaluation metrics and training-free techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the issue of hallucination in MLLMs where systematic localization errors undermine the reliability of GUI agents, prompting the need for better evaluation and uncertainty metrics.

Method: The authors propose a fine-grained evaluation framework for analyzing model predictions, introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) for better uncertainty quantification, and develop Context-Aware Cropping as a technique to refine input context.

Result: Experiments show that these methods provide significant performance improvements, better interpretability, and enhanced robustness for GUI agent behaviors.

Conclusion: The paper's proposed framework and techniques advance the understanding, evaluation, and reliability of multimodal large language models in GUI agent applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2 is a framework designed to enhance large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems, achieving superior performance in complex reasoning tasks through innovative architectural and operational strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome critical challenges in multi-agent LLM systems related to architecture design, domain generalizability, and performance, especially as tasks and agents become more complex.

Method: The proposed framework employs (1) a hierarchical and parallel architecture for task decomposition, (2) an adaptive collaboration engine to dynamically select LLM combinations based on tasks, and (3) optimization strategies for task decomposition efficiency.

Result: AgentGroupChat-V2 significantly outperforms baselines across various benchmarks, such as GSM8K (91.5%), AIME (30.4%), and HumanEval (79.2% pass@1), with notable gains in challenging tasks like Level 5 MATH problems (11+ percentage points improvement).

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 is a robust solution for constructing efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems, excelling in complex reasoning and task resolution across domains.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

*Xinnuo Xu,Rachel Lawrence,Kshitij Dubey,Atharva Pandey,Risa Ueno,Fabian Falck,Aditya V. Nori,Rahul Sharma,Amit Sharma,Javier Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RE-IMAGINE, a framework for testing and analyzing reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify whether performance on reasoning benchmarks arises from genuine reasoning or mere statistical recall.

Method: Introduced RE-IMAGINE, a framework to create problem variations using intermediate symbolic manipulation, applicable across reasoning domains such as math, logic, and coding.

Result: Observed performance reductions in LLMs when faced with problem variations, suggesting reliance on statistical recall over true reasoning.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE effectively reveals gaps in genuine reasoning ability in LLMs and provides a foundation for future research on reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a method that enhances grounding in large language models and reduces hallucination by improving reliance on external context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of ungrounded generation when external knowledge is added during inference in large language models, and address the challenge of reducing hallucinations and ensuring factual consistency.

Method: CINGS trains the model by prepending relevant context to the response during supervision and masking out the context while computing the loss only over response tokens.

Result: CINGS improves grounding across textual and visual domains, outperforming other methods, reducing hallucinations in vision-language tasks, and maintaining factual consistency without degrading overall performance.

Conclusion: CINGS encourages reliance on external context and shifts the model's prior knowledge, leading to enhanced grounding and reduced hallucination across multiple domains and datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE is an efficient single-pass annotation methodology for LLMs, aligning solution steps with reference steps for structured step-wise supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in automating efficient and high-quality process annotations for complex multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: The SPARE framework aligns solution steps with reference solutions for single-pass annotation and uses reference-guided step-level evaluations.

Result: SPARE enables better reasoning performance in fine-tuning and ranking scenarios, achieving competitive results on mathematical datasets with increased efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE offers a structured, efficient approach to process supervision, improving reasoning capabilities of LLMs and reducing runtime significantly compared to tree search methods.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [53] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection, achieving significant improvements over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbole and metaphor are challenging to identify in NLP due to their semantic complexity and diversity. Current methods overlook their interrelations and the role of implicit emotions.

Method: The proposed EmoBi framework includes an emotion analysis module, a domain mapping module for deeper understanding, and a bidirectional dynamic interaction module to integrate insights from hyperbole and metaphor.

Result: EmoBi outperformed all baselines on four datasets, with the F1 score improving by 28.1% and 23.1% for hyperbole and metaphor detection, respectively.

Conclusion: EmoBi demonstrates the effectiveness of an emotion-driven approach, highlighting its potential to enhance detection performance and understanding of rhetorical devices.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning and internal reasoning to make responses more grounded, trustworthy, and well-cited. The study finds reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-tuned ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack robustness in generating grounded and trustworthy responses, often failing to handle unanswerable queries or citing sources correctly. The motivation is to make LLMs more reliable and precise.

Method: The authors apply the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method using rewards based on correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality. They experiment with a two-stage training strategy and incorporate distillation with GPT-4 to further enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Through experiments on datasets like ASQA and QAMPARI, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements in reasoning-augmented models compared to instruction-tuned models, especially in handling unanswerable queries and citation accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and reinforcement learning are effective strategies to improve grounding and trustworthiness in LLMs. Combining these approaches with instruction tuning can significantly enhance long-form, generative QA tasks.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [55] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION is a novel local-global attention model addressing efficiency versus performance trade-offs by incorporating linear attention for out-of-window token handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency for local-global attention models without sacrificing performance in short-context scenarios.

Method: Introduced RATTENTION, integrating local attention with a linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window tokens, supported by a specialized kernel implementation.

Result: Pretraining experiments demonstrate better performance-efficiency tradeoff and enhanced long-context capabilities, validated on the RULER benchmark.

Conclusion: RATTENTION provides a compelling alternative, achieving high efficiency and performance even with reduced window sizes, matching full-attention model standards.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses methods to approximate training data from language model weights using a gradient-based technique, successfully recovering high-performing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many modern language models do not publicly disclose their training data, raising challenges for transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability in model development.

Method: The authors formalize data approximation, introduce metrics and baselines, and propose a gradient-based methodology that identifies high-matching text from a public corpus based on model weights.

Result: Their approach improves task performance significantly, such as increasing AG News task accuracy from 65% to 80% and reducing perplexity in SFT-trained models from 3.3 to 2.3.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively recovers high-performing datasets from model weights alone, approaching expert level benchmarks and offering a valuable tool for independent validation of model training data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

### [57] [PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15556)
*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Predictive Generation (PredGen) framework to reduce latency in real-time voice chat applications using LLMs, achieving around 2x latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant latency issues in LLM-based real-time voice chat applications, especially noticeable on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: The PredGen framework employs speculative decoding during user speech to predict responses, allowing TTS systems to initiate audio output with reduced delay.

Result: PredGen demonstrates a latency reduction of around 2x in simulations using the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets, while requiring minimal additional computational resources.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively addresses latency issues in LLM-driven voice chats, enhancing user experience on limited computational resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

*Zhengyang Shan,Emily Ruth Diana,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) to evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) handle binary and non-binary genders, pointing out significant variations and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on non-binary gender inclusivity in LLM evaluations and propose a comprehensive metric to assess fairness.

Method: Developed GIFI, a metric that evaluates LLMs at multiple levels including pronoun handling, text generation, and cognitive behavior, then applied it to 22 different LLMs.

Result: Revealed that different LLMs exhibit significant variations in their gender inclusivity and identified biases in their handling of diverse gender identifiers.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs' inclusivity is essential, and GIFI provides a benchmark to guide future advancements in gender fairness of generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

*Chengye Wang,Yifei Shen,Zexi Kuang,Arman Cohan,Yilun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciVer is a new benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models' ability to verify scientific claims in multimodal contexts, with 3,000 examples and analysis of state-of-the-art models showing limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with verifying multimodal scientific claims, highlighting the need for dedicated evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The authors developed SciVer, a benchmark dataset with 3,000 examples and supporting evidence for fine-grained model evaluation, and tested 21 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Performance of tested models lagged behind human experts, revealing significant gaps in their ability to handle multimodal scientific claim verification.

Conclusion: Critical limitations in current models were identified, providing insights for improving future models' multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

### [60] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a new task for more effective discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing, with a novel dataset and method that dramatically improve parsing compared to current techniques, addressing issues like fragmented graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text scene graph parsers struggle with discourse-level visual descriptions due to fragmented graphs from single-sentence parsing approaches, limiting performance in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Method: The authors propose DiscoSG-Refiner, a system that first drafts a graph using a small PLM, and then iteratively refines it using a second PLM to achieve improved parsing and efficient inference.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE metrics by 30% compared to baselines and performs 86 times faster inference than GPT-4, contributing to better downstream VLM tasks like caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: The DiscoSG approach advances discourse-level graph parsing, enabling significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in VLM tasks, with open-source resources provided for further development.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

*Negar Foroutan,Angelika Romanou,Matin Ansaripour,Julian Martin Eisenschlos,Karl Aberer,Rémi Lebret*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in document understanding, revealing significant performance gaps in handling long contexts and multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing document understanding benchmarks by creating a dataset that challenges models to perform complex, multi-modal reasoning over long-context documents.

Method: The researchers developed WikiMixQA, a collection of 1,000 multiple-choice questions derived from 4,000 Wikipedia pages with tables and charts, spanning seven topics, to test vision-language models.

Result: The evaluation of 12 models shows that proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context but perform poorly in long-document retrieval; GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy, while open-source models top at 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA highlights the limitations of current vision-language models in long-context, multi-modal reasoning, serving as an essential benchmark for future advancements in document understanding.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

*Bernardo Leite,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pedro Pinto,Abel Ferreira,Luís Abreu,Isabel Rangel,Sandra Monteiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates generative AI models' ability to produce MCQs in Portuguese, focusing on reading comprehension and curriculum alignment, with expert reviews and student response analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the time-consuming nature of manual MCQ creation and the limited exploration of generative AI for non-English languages, specifically Portuguese.

Method: The study uses generative AI to create Portuguese MCQs, aligns them with curriculum objectives, assesses difficulty levels, and evaluates quality through expert reviews and psychometric analysis of student responses.

Result: The results show that generative AI models can produce MCQs of comparable quality to human-created ones but face challenges with semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor design.

Conclusion: Generative AI offers promise for automating MCQ creation, but further refinement is needed to resolve issues in semantic and distractor quality for widespread application.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates 'regret' in large language models (LLMs), focusing on how regret expressions are detected and processed at the neural level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM reliability and gain deeper insights into neural coding of cognitive processes, specifically through understanding regret expressions.

Method: The researchers used a novel workflow to create a regret dataset, introduced metrics (S-CDI, RDS, and GIC) for analyzing optimal layers and neuron functionalities in model regret processing.

Result: They successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer and uncovered an M-shaped processing pattern. Neurons were categorized into regret, non-regret, and dual groups.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational tools and insights into how cognitive functions like regret are represented and processed in LLMs, paving the way for improving model reliability.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines cross-cultural communication misunderstandings in British and American English through experiments and a cognitive model, concluding these misunderstandings arise from combined literal meaning and pragmatic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication occur, specifically whether they stem from literal meanings of words or pragmatic factors like politeness.

Method: Three experiments and a computational cognitive model were conducted, focusing on the interpretation of intensifiers like 'quite' and 'very' by British and American English speakers.

Result: Findings show cross-cultural differences stem from both literal differences in word meanings and differing emphasis on utterance cost among cultures.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural communication differences emerge from a complex interplay between semantics and pragmatics, not solely from either factor.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [65] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Ordered CommonGen," a benchmark for testing large language models (LLMs) on generating sentences that adhere to a given order of concepts. Current LLMs show limitations in following such ordered instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the ability of LLMs to follow ordered instructions and demonstrate compositional generalization in sentence generation.

Method: Introduced the Ordered CommonGen benchmark, which evaluates LLMs based on their ability to generate sentences with concepts arranged in a specified order (ordered coverage). Tested and analyzed 36 different LLMs to identify their performance trends.

Result: LLMs show a tendency to follow instructions but often produce outputs with low diversity or identical sequences when concept order changes. The top-performing LLM only achieved about 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: Significant improvements are needed in LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization skills to effectively handle tasks like Ordered CommonGen.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The study explores Romanian authorship attribution using six machine learning techniques, finding that ANN with character n-grams offers state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective authorship attribution methods for Romanian texts, a relatively under-studied language.

Method: Six machine learning models (SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, and ANN) were tested on the ROST corpus using character n-gram features for classification.

Result: The ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Lightweight character n-gram approaches can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in Romanian authorship attribution, making them viable for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CC-Learn is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve reasoning consistency in large language models (LLMs) by focusing on cohorts of related questions. It uses a composite objective combining accuracy, problem decomposition, and penalties for invalid reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, despite their success, struggle with consistent and robust reasoning, necessitating solutions for better reliability.

Method: The paper introduces CC-Learn, which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning patterns across cohorts of similar questions using a composite objective that includes cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus, and a rejection penalty.

Result: Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ARC-Challenge, StrategyQA) showed that CC-Learn outperformed pretrained and supervised fine-tuning baselines in terms of accuracy and reasoning stability.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning is effective in enhancing the reasoning consistency and reliability of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights that reasoning traces in large models can unintentionally leak sensitive user data, especially during increased reasoning steps, posing privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether the reasoning traces of large models, often considered safe and internal, actually pose privacy risks and reveal user data.

Method: Used probing and agentic evaluations to assess privacy leakage during reasoning, focusing on the effect of test-time compute approaches such as increased reasoning steps.

Result: Reasoning traces were found to leak sensitive information, with verbose reasoning steps amplifying this leakage despite improving utility.

Conclusion: Privacy risks extend to internal reasoning traces of models, necessitating safety measures that address both outputs and internal processes.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

*Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 21 machine translation systems for gender neutrality and observes a lack of gender-neutral translations, despite exploring some strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misgendering and representation harms in machine translation caused by gender ambiguity in source and grammatical gender languages.

Method: Analyzing the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity across three translation directions, categorizing gender-neutral strategies, and examining binary gender stereotypes.

Result: Most MT systems fail to produce gender-neutral translations when gender ambiguity exists. A few systems apply specific strategies based on the target language.

Conclusion: MT systems generally lack capability for gender-neutral translation, but some approaches show potential in specific contexts.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenRecal, a distillation framework for transferring knowledge between diverse vision-language models (VLMs), achieving better performance than both open and closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to optimize the deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) on resource-constrained devices by creating smaller, efficient models via knowledge distillation, which is hindered by the diversity in VLM architectures.

Method: The authors propose the Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal) framework, which employs a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, facilitating effective knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal outperforms baseline methods and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs on multiple challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal is a general-purpose solution for VLM knowledge distillation, addressing architectural diversity and enabling the deployment of high-performing models in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

*Yuhui Shi,Yehan Yang,Qiang Sheng,Hao Mi,Beizhe Hu,Chaoxi Xu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a new method to detect LLM-generated text, particularly from unseen, privately-tuned models, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing usage of LLMs has heightened risks of misinformation and academic misconduct, making robust detection of LLM-generated text crucial, especially for private, fine-tuned models.

Method: PhantomHunter employs a family-aware learning framework to identify shared traits of base LLMs and their derivatives, rather than relying on individual model characteristics.

Result: PhantomHunter outperforms 7 baseline methods and 3 industrial tools, achieving F1 scores above 96% in detecting text from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral model families.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter is an effective solution for detecting text generated by privately-tuned LLMs and addresses limitations of existing detection methods.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of accurately identifying graphical and implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks.

Method: The proposed SemIRNet incorporates ConceptNet for common-sense reasoning, utilizes cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules for word-level and sample-level modeling, and employs a contrastive learning loss function for better sample feature separability.

Conclusion: By fusing knowledge and enhancing semantic similarity detection mechanisms, the model effectively improves the performance of multimodal irony detection.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with

*Harsha Koduri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable animal monitoring, combining visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning to answer queries about animal imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enable better monitoring of animal populations in natural settings, combining visual and language analysis for structured understanding.

Method: ViLLa integrates visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning, grounded in modular and transparent processing to answer animal-related questions based on images and queries.

Result: The system was tested on diverse animal imagery tasks, showcasing its ability to bridge visual content and structured language queries effectively.

Conclusion: ViLLa provides a modular, interpretable approach to animal monitoring, presenting clear advantages over black-box models in terms of transparency and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

### [76] [GraphGSOcc: Semantic and Geometric Graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825)
*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphGSOcc, a new model for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, addressing shortcomings in feature aggregation and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D Gaussian Splating in this domain fail to consider semantic correlations among similar categories and suffer from boundary ambiguities due to insufficient geometric constraints.

Method: The GraphGSOcc model utilizes Dual Gaussians Graph Attention for dynamic construction of geometric and semantic graphs combined with a Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, optimizing both local boundary details and global object-level topology.

Result: Results on the SurroundOcc dataset show improved mIoU (24.10%, up by 1.97%) and reduced GPU memory usage (6.1 GB, 13.7% less) compared to a prior method (GaussianWorld).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc successfully enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction performance while lowering computational costs, making it a valuable tool for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

*Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Hongyu Su,Juncheng Li,Yunhan Zhao,Lin Luo,Zixing Chen,Li Wang,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVID-X introduces a dataset with detailed annotations paired with a video-language model (DAVID-XR1) to enable explainable and transparent detection of AI-generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing proliferation of AI-generated videos makes it vital to not only detect synthetic content but also provide interpretable evidence for such detection.

Method: The paper introduces the DAVID-X dataset annotated with detailed defect-level temporal-spatial information and rationales, and the DAVID-XR1 video-language model that employs a chain-of-thought distillation method for explainable video content analysis.

Result: The fine-tuned model with a general-purpose backbone achieves robust generalization across various generators and modes, proving the effectiveness of explainable detection.

Conclusion: The approach transforms AI-generated video detection into a transparent process, offering not just binary decisions but credible and interpretable evidence, which could enhance trustworthiness in identifying synthetic video content.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD is a DETR-based monocular 3D detection framework featuring innovative mechanisms like Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and self-distillation. It achieves top performance in KITTI and integrates well with other architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inherent limitations in DETR-based monocular 3D detection methods and enhance their ability to precisely localize 3D objects from a single image.

Method: MonoVQD introduces three main contributions: Mask Separated Self-Attention for stable Hungarian matching, Variational Query Denoising to solve gradient vanishing, and self-distillation for improved query quality across layers.

Result: MonoVQD outperforms existing methods on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark and provides significant performance gains in multi-view 3D detection on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: MonoVQD fundamentally advances monocular 3D detection and generalizes effectively across architectures and datasets, confirming its scientific and practical impact.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [82] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method, to improve chart-to-code generation tasks for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by using structured instructions and a two-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the suboptimal performance of MLLMs on the chart-to-code generation task, which is challenging due to the need for precise visual understanding and accurate code translation.

Method: The proposed ChartIR method separates chart-to-code tasks into visual understanding and code translation. It employs structured instructions (description and difference) and breaks the process into initial code generation and iterative refinement.

Result: ChartIR outperforms other methods in chart-to-code generation on both open-source Qwen2-VL and closed-source GPT-4o models, as proven by experiments.

Conclusion: ChartIR demonstrates that structured instructions and iterative refinement enable MLLMs to significantly improve their capability in chart-to-code generation tasks.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

### [83] [PictSure: Pretraining Embeddings Matters for In-Context Learning Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14842)
*Lukas Schiesser,Cornelius Wolff,Sophie Haas,Simon Pukrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PictSure, an in-context learning framework for few-shot image classification that places emphasis on selecting and analyzing visual embedding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification in data-scarce domains is limited by the challenges of collecting large labeled datasets, necessitating better generalization methods without gradient-based adaptation.

Method: The study involves a systematic examination of embedding models, focusing on visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies to optimize performance in few-shot learning.

Result: PictSure outperforms prior FSIC approaches on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining strong results on in-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The choice and training dynamics of embedding models are critical for enhancing few-shot learning performance, and PictSure successfully leverages this insight for effective domain generalization.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

### [84] [Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846)
*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BKSEF, a framework to optimize CNN kernel sizes for better performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked issue of kernel size selection in CNNs, which impacts model performance and computational costs.

Method: The proposed method, BKSEF, uses a combination of information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to determine optimal kernel sizes layer-wise.

Result: BKSEF achieves up to 3.1% improvement in accuracy and reduces FLOPs by 42.8% compared to models using fixed 3x3 kernels. Case studies validate its practical utility.

Conclusion: Kernel size can be optimized rather than fixed, with BKSEF offering a theoretically-grounded and practically effective method for designing efficient CNN architectures.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning-based method to automate retail video annotation by identifying key frames and providing automatic annotations, achieving comparable accuracy to human labeling while reducing operational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retail video annotation methods rely heavily on manual labeling, which is time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors.

Method: The proposed method employs deep neural networks for learning discriminative features and uses object detection techniques tailored for retail environments to automate key-frame selection and annotation.

Result: The approach achieves human-level accuracy, reduces manual verification to less than 5%, and offers a 2x cost savings in annotation tasks.

Conclusion: This method enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of retail video annotation, making it highly beneficial for applications like customer analysis, product interaction detection, and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

### [86] [Peering into the Unknown: Active View Selection with Neural Uncertainty Maps for 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14856)
*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UPNet, a lightweight neural network for fast and efficient active view selection (AVS) in 3D reconstruction. Using uncertainty maps predicted from input images, it selects minimal viewpoints for high reconstruction accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of identifying the minimal set of views to achieve accurate 3D object reconstruction, improving efficiency and reducing computational overhead.

Method: UPNet predicts neural uncertainty maps directly from single input images of 3D objects. It aggregates these maps over successive views to suppress redundancy and select the most informative viewpoints for reconstruction.

Result: UPNet achieves comparable accuracy to competitive methods while using half the viewpoints. It provides up to 400x speedup in computation and reduces hardware resource usage by over 50%.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently selects informative views for 3D reconstruction, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. It generalizes well to novel object categories without retraining.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores DPO-Kernels to enhance alignment in text-to-image models, incorporating hybrid losses, kernelized representations, and advanced divergences, alongside the introduction of the DETONATE benchmark and Alignment Quality Index (AQI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address alignment issues in text-to-image models to improve accuracy and safety in image generation, ensuring equitable representation and robustness against biased inputs.

Method: The authors develop DPO-Kernels employing hybrid loss functions, kernelized representations with advanced kernel methods (RBF, Polynomial, Wavelet), and alternative divergences (Wasserstein, R'enyi) to optimize alignment. They also introduce the DETONATE benchmark and AQI for evaluation.

Result: The study shows that DPO-Kernels achieve enhanced alignment with strong generalization bounds and improved latent separability of safe versus unsafe activations, supported by empirical evaluations using the DETONATE dataset.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels significantly improve alignment in T2I models, offering better optimization and safety measures, while the DETONATE benchmark and AQI provide tools for evaluating and addressing bias-related vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PeRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to improve multimodal reasoning tasks, particularly in multi-image scenarios, and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing multimodal RL approaches that excel in spatial reasoning for single images but struggle with multi-image positional reasoning, crucial for complex real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose PeRL, which includes mechanisms like image sequence permutation for positional diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to explore-exploit efficiently.

Result: PeRL demonstrated superior performance on 5 multi-image benchmarks and maintained competitive results on 3 single-image benchmarks, outperforming previous approaches by a significant margin.

Conclusion: PeRL showcases the potential of reinforcement learning in enhancing multimodal reasoning for both single- and multi-image tasks, providing a robust framework for tackling complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method (Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error, FCRE) that improves membership inference attacks (MIA) on diffusion models in medical imaging by focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns in medical imaging caused by diffusion models, particularly through Membership Inference Attacks, while considering the limitations of traditional MIA methods tied to reconstruction errors.

Method: The method involves analyzing mid-frequency reconstruction errors using a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) approach, incorporating structural similarity indices to determine whether a medical image was part of the training dataset of a diffusion model.

Result: The FCRE method showed superior performance in MIA tasks when tested on several medical image datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This study provides an advanced and effective method for improving MIAs in medical imaging diffusion models, addressing significant privacy risks by focusing on frequency-specific reconstruction errors.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures and ViT-CNN hybrids for quark-gluon jet classification, showing superior performance over traditional CNNs in calorimeter image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for improved jet classification in high-energy physics at the Large Hadron Collider, exploring whether ViT architectures can model global contextual information more effectively than CNNs under realistic detector conditions.

Method: The authors use 2012 CMS Open Data to create multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits and reconstructed tracks, enabling end-to-end learning with ViT and ViT-CNN hybrid models. They benchmark these against established CNN baselines.

Result: ViT-based models, especially ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform CNNs in metrics like F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, demonstrating better capture of long-range spatial correlations in jet substructure.

Conclusion: This work sets a benchmark by establishing systematic frameworks and robust baselines for applying ViT architectures in jet classification and provides structured datasets for advancing deep learning in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

*Ziteng Li,Malte Kuhlmann,Ilana Nisky,Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two machine learning models using tactile sensor data to improve compliance estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection suffers from issues such as lack of portability, scalability, expense, and unsuitability for robotics, along with limitations in neural network-based approaches.

Method: Two models based on LRCNs and Transformer architectures leverage RGB tactile images from GelSight sensors to predict compliance metrics.

Result: The proposed models outperform existing benchmarks in compliance prediction accuracy, and correlations between sensor-object compliance are explored.

Conclusion: The research advances compliance estimation by improving prediction accuracy and identifying challenges in harder-than-sensor object estimation.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

*Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PALETTE, an advanced method for extracting text from scanned historical maps, overcoming challenges like complex backgrounds and rotation, and coupled with SynthMap+, a synthetic dataset generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges processing diverse and complex historical map text due to inadequate methods and lack of training data.

Method: The authors propose PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter featuring a hyper-local sampling module and positional embeddings, combined with SynthMap+ for synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE, paired with SynthMap+, surpassed state-of-the-art methods in extracting text from challenging historical maps and successfully processed 60,000 maps to create a searchable database.

Conclusion: PALETTE with SynthMap+ is a significant advancement for text extraction from historical maps, enabling effective large-scale applications.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StyleWallfacer, a unified framework enabling artistic-level style transfer and text-driven stylization with advanced methods for semantic-based style injection, data augmentation, and a training-free triple diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of traditional style transfer methods while unifying frameworks for different artistic tasks such as image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: Key methods include semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP, data augmentation through human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process for manipulating self-attention layers with style-text control.

Result: The framework achieves high-quality, artist-level style transfer while effectively preserving original content and introduces image color editing during the process.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer innovates the field by delivering superior style transfer results and addressing challenges like semantic alignment, overfitting reduction, and text-based stylization, setting a new benchmark for artistic applications.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in vector quantization methods—training instability and codebook collapse—and proposes a solution using Wasserstein distance to improve codebook utilization and reduce quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods face two key challenges: training instability caused by gradient discrepancies and codebook collapse due to uneven utilization of code vectors.

Method: The authors employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, ensuring representative code vectors and mitigating information loss.

Result: By aligning distributions with Wasserstein distance, the method achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly lowers quantization errors.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is validated empirically and theoretically, proving its effectiveness in addressing stability and optimization issues in vector quantization for autoregressive models.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPo, a training-free method for few-shot medical image segmentation using Large Vision Models, focuses on improving negative prompts for better results on low-contrast images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVMs-based training-free methods fail to utilize negative prompts effectively, leading to poor segmentation results for low-contrast medical images.

Method: SynPo introduces a Confidence Map Synergy Module combining DINOv2 and SAM. It uses top-k pixels from a reliable confidence map for positive prompts and Gaussian distribution-based clustering for negative prompts. These prompts are fed into SAM for segmentation.

Result: SynPo achieves comparable segmentation performance to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Improving the quality of negative prompts via SynPo provides a reliable training-free solution for medical image segmentation with results on par with advanced methods.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

*Jiaqi Shi,Jin Xiao,Xiaoguang Hu,Boyang Song,Hao Jiang,Tianyou Chen,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Point Distribution Set Abstraction" (PDSA) module for point cloud analysis, improving computational efficiency and robustness in feature aggregation for tasks like semantic segmentation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in local coordinate-based point aggregation in point cloud analysis, such as irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational costs, and noise sensitivity.

Method: The proposed PDSA module uses high-dimensional correlation to correct feature distribution during aggregation. It applies a cross-stage structural descriptor to reduce variance in neighbor features and enhance class separability while using a key point mechanism to lower computational overhead.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements in semantic segmentation and classification tasks across different baselines using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The PDSA module is effective and rational for improving point cloud analysis, with verified generalization, efficiency, and reduced costs.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and
training weight is available at: https://github.com/AGENT9717/PointDistribution

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial, but challenging due to noisy ultrasound images and ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Introduced Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion conditioning, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: Echo-DND outperformed state-of-the-art models achieving Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets new standards in echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis)," a task that combines large-scale image retrieval with fine-grained localization of objects mentioned in textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual search techniques either locate objects in images assuming they always exist (leading to high false positives on large datasets) or retrieve relevant images but lack pixel-level object localization. There is a gap in achieving both simultaneously for large-scale, realistic search scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a new task, ReSeDis, that requires both identifying the presence of an object described by text in a collection of images and localizing it with bounding boxes or segmentation masks. They curated a benchmark dataset with unique descriptions and developed a metric to jointly score retrieval accuracy and localization precision. Additionally, they provide a zero-shot baseline using a vision-language model.

Result: ReSeDis is established as a challenging benchmark for integrating retrieval and localization tasks. The zero-shot baseline demonstrates significant performance gaps, indicating room for improvement in multimodal search systems.

Conclusion: ReSeDis provides a realistic platform for developing robust, scalable solutions to multimodal search challenges, unifying retrieval and precise localization of queried objects.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of specialized models for medical image analysis, which require expertise and considerable resources, by exploring generalist models that permit task flexibility.

Method: The authors use visual in-context learning (VICL) to train models that generalize across various retinal OCT tasks based on a few examples at inference time, coupled with a rigorous evaluation protocol.

Result: A state-of-the-art VICL approach is extensively evaluated on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline and identifying the strengths and current limitations.

Conclusion: This work showcases the potential of VICL in OCT, provides an evaluation protocol, and openly shares resources to encourage further research and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), a method for user privacy protection by altering image compression to block interpretation by vision-language pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With enhanced semantic capabilities of vision-language pretrained models, widely shared images are at risk of being misused by search engines and similar tools, creating a need for protective mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose PSIC, which uses Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) to bias decoding outcomes and employs an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented optimization function to confuse pretrained models, combined with adaptive multi-objective optimization for strong performance.

Result: PSIC can generate images that achieve good perceptual qualities while impeding understanding by VLP models, with performance validated across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PSIC method safeguards user privacy by integrating privacy protections into Learned Image Compression models without significant compromise to image quality or functionality.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to improve multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF), enabling better image quality and diagnostic utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing MMIF methods, which struggle to capture detailed features and suffer from weak cross-modal feature interaction, leading to lower-quality fused images.

Method: The method involves a two-stage diffusion model. Stage I uses UNet with a denoising process for feature extraction, while Stage II inputs noisy images into a fusion network, integrating three adaptive fusion modules and a hybrid loss function to enhance feature recognition and image quality.

Result: The experimental results show that DM-FNet achieves exceptional performance across various medical image types, providing images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and detail, as well as preserving intricate textures and sharp edges.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DM-FNet overcomes existing method limitations by improving image fusion quality and ensuring diagnostic reliability in multimodal medical imaging.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to generate detailed and accurate video descriptions for better video understanding motivated the development of a more efficient and high-performing video captioning model.

Method: The authors employed low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with a novel multi-round Directed Preference Optimization (MrDPO) approach to train the model. This included periodically updating the reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module after each training cycle (1,000 steps), and leveraging ground-truth video captions to stabilize training.

Result: Video-SALMONN 2 achieved significant improvements in captioning accuracy, reducing error rates by 28%. The model, with only 7 billion parameters, outperformed larger models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning and remained competitive in video QA tasks against state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2, with its advanced techniques, delivers state-of-the-art results in video captioning, setting a new benchmark and offering a compact yet powerful alternative to larger models.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in SAR ship detection like scale variations, offshore noise, and complex backgrounds hindering accurate identification in maritime applications.

Method: The framework uses a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module for better feature representation and BiFormer attention integrated into BiFPN for advanced cross-scale feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) show improved detection accuracy, robustness against occlusions, and effective handling of multi-scale features.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN significantly advances the performance in SAR ship detection, demonstrating better small-target recognition, resilience, and adaptability.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RA-NeRF, a method enhancing camera pose estimation and visual quality in scene reconstruction under complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera pose estimation methods often struggle with accuracy when handling complex trajectories, requiring a solution for improved precision.

Method: RA-NeRF employs NeRF with photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter to improve pose estimation and scene reconstruction.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and visual quality on both Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF demonstrates robustness and effectiveness in scene reconstruction, addressing issues with camera poses in scenarios involving complex trajectories.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Chenxi Zhang,Jiayun Wu,Qing Zhang,Yazhe Zhai,Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RetroMem, a recall-augmented architecture for camouflaged object detection, which utilizes historical knowledge for improved inference and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camouflaged object detection lack mechanisms to leverage historical context, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness in challenging scenarios.

Method: RetroMem employs a two-stage paradigm: a learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) for foundational inferences, and a recall stage with dynamic memory mechanisms (DMM) and inference pattern reconstruction (IPR) to integrate historical knowledge.

Result: RetroMem shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several datasets for camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: RetroMem's innovative architecture demonstrates the potential to dynamically modulate perception and inference, advancing the field of camouflaged object detection through the use of historical context and adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: The high demand and competition in semiconductors require optimized defect classification methods. Leveraging DA minimizes manual efforts and enhances adaptability in this field.

Method: The paper employs both semi-supervised and unsupervised DA techniques, proposing the DBACS model with advanced loss terms, and validates it using Electron Microscope images.

Result: The DBACS model demonstrates improved performance and utility in DA applications for semiconductor defect detection through tests on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DA techniques and DBACS model advance the field of semiconductor defect classification, proving their scalability and reliability for Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSNeRV, a novel multi-scale feature fusion framework for neural video representation to improve video compression efficiency, particularly for dynamic and detailed content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INR-based methods for video compression cannot effectively represent fast-changing and detail-rich video content due to limited use of internal network features and the lack of video-focused network designs.

Method: MSNeRV employs several strategies: using temporal windows for temporal consistency, dividing videos into Groups of Pictures (GoPs) with GoP-level grids for background representation, and introducing multi-scale spatial decoders and feature blocks with scale-adaptive loss functions.

Result: MSNeRV outperforms traditional INR-based methods and VTM-23.7 (Random Access) codec in handling dynamic videos on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets, showing superior compression and representation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed MSNeRV framework efficiently handles detail-intensive and fast-changing video content, marking an advance in neural video compression technology.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BCRNet, a novel framework that improves curvilinear anatomy landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery using Bezier curve refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of identifying critical anatomical structures during laparoscopic liver surgery, where precise detection enhances augmented reality (AR) navigation systems.

Method: The proposed method, BCRNet, utilizes a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module, Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI), and Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) to iteratively refine pixel-aligned Bezier curves for accurate detection.

Result: BCRNet demonstrated enhanced performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the L3D and P2ILF datasets, achieving significant improvements.

Conclusion: BCRNet is effective in improving AR surgical navigation by enhancing anatomical landmark detection, and its methodologies mark a significant advancement in the field of laparoscopic surgery.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

TL;DR: RaCalNet proposes to reduce dependency on dense LiDAR supervision for depth estimation using radar and RGB inputs by utilizing sparse LiDAR supervision, achieving higher accuracy and improved texture and contour detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the costly and data-intensive nature of dense LiDAR supervision required for metric depth estimation using radar and RGB inputs.

Method: The RaCalNet framework refines sparse radar measurements to construct accurate depth priors, which then guide monocular depth prediction, achieving depth estimation accuracy without dense supervision.

Result: On the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios, RaCalNet improves structural consistency and fine details, reducing RMSE by over 34%, outperforming state-of-the-art dense-supervised models.

Conclusion: Sparse LiDAR supervision via RaCalNet offers an efficient alternative to dense methods for radar-based depth estimation, balancing accuracy and resource efficiency while maintaining high structural and texture fidelity.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (VLMs) on memory-intensive, long-horizon embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large VLMs show promise in control tasks, they struggle with integrating long-term memory across vast image collections, limiting their utility in embodied contexts like robotics. Current benchmarks fail to address this gap.

Method: The paper develops a benchmark in the Habitat simulator for assessing memory-driven performance in 60 tasks. It involves integrating state-of-the-art VLMs with navigation policies to evaluate contextual reasoning and navigation.

Result: The benchmark identifies limitations in current VLMs' ability to handle memory-intensive tasks, pinpointing areas that require improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark enables scalable evaluation of embodied agents' memory and reasoning capabilities, and provides a foundation for advancing VLM performance in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

Motivation: To address the limitations of treating ME spotting and recognition as separate tasks and to capitalize on advancements in multimodal large models for enhanced ME analysis.

Method: The MEGC 2025 proposes two tasks: (1) ME-STR, integrating ME spotting and recognition into a single sequential pipeline; (2) ME-VQA, utilizing multimodal reasoning capabilities of large models to answer diverse visual questions about MEs.

Result: Details for participation and testing are outlined, with a leaderboard system for algorithm evaluations on a provided test set.

Conclusion: The challenge fosters a shift towards unified and multimodal approaches in ME research, encouraging innovative solutions under new task frameworks.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating

Motivation: Traditional Active Learning methods assume all unannotated images belong to target classes, which is not practical since unlabeled datasets in real-world clinical environments often contain OOD samples. There is also inefficiency in initial random sample selection in open-set scenarios.

Method: The method, OpenPath, uses pre-trained VLMs with task-specific prompts for initial sample selection, focusing on In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples. Subsequent queries employ Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS), combining Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS), which ensures purity and informativeness of selected samples.

Result: Experiments on two public pathology image datasets demonstrate that OpenPath improves model performance due to high-quality sample selection and outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively addresses challenges in open-set active learning scenarios for pathological image classification by improving annotation efficiency and model performance through its innovative querying strategies.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the open-world object counting task in videos via text or image prompts, presenting CountVid, a model for accurate counting. It also provides a new dataset (VideoCount) for evaluation and achieves significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object counting in videos in open-world scenarios where traditional methods struggle due to challenges like occlusion, crowded scenes, and similar objects.

Method: The paper proposes CountVid, which combines an image-based counting model with a promptable video segmentation and tracking system. A new dataset, VideoCount, is created to assess performance.

Result: CountVid is shown to deliver accurate object counts across video frames and outperforms strong baseline methods, as validated by experiments using the new VideoCount dataset.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a novel approach to open-world object counting in videos, demonstrating robustness and accuracy through CountVid and VideoCount while openly sharing resources for further research.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

*Aleksandr Algasov,Ekaterina Nepovinnykh,Fedor Zolotarev,Tuomas Eerola,Heikki Kälviäinen,Pavel Zemčík,Charles V. Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometry-aware texture mapping approach for robust animal re-identification, focusing on challenging cases like seals and leopards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal re-identification remains challenging due to distortions in fur or skin patterns caused by body movements and posture changes. A better feature matching method is needed.

Method: The authors propose unwarping pelage patterns into a canonical UV space by using surface normal estimation to preserve geometric consistency between 3D and 2D spaces.

Result: Integrating their UV mapping technique improved re-identification accuracy by up to 5.4% on seal and leopard datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables accurate and pose-agnostic animal re-identification without requiring ground-truth UV annotations, offering improvements for species with deformable fur patterns.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

*Yujin Kim,Hyunsoo Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDIS, a Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that uses a text-to-image diffusion model to generate high-quality images aligning with the training data distribution without accessing the original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) methods struggle to generate accurate samples due to the lack of prior knowledge about natural images, limiting their ability to represent the original training data.

Method: The paper proposes DDIS, which employs a text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior and introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) for better domain alignment during diffusion sampling. It also introduces a Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to capture class-specific attributes.

Result: DDIS outperforms previous DFIS methods in generating images that resemble the training data distribution, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PACS and ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: DDIS successfully leverages diffusion models and alignment strategies to improve data-free image synthesis, providing a significant advancement in generating synthetic data that approximates the original training data.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

*Anju Chhetri,Jari Korhonen,Prashnna Gyawali,Binod Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuron-level-based method called NERO for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in medical imaging, improving reliability and explainability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of deep learning models in medical imaging by addressing the issue of identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which are critical for flagging anomalies.

Method: The proposed method, NERO, clusters neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form centroids, calculates relevance distance for new samples, and incorporates scaled relevance and feature norms for better OOD detection.

Result: The framework, validated on deep learning architectures using the Kvasir and GastroVision benchmarks, outperforms existing OOD detection methods in gastrointestinal imaging.

Conclusion: NERO provides a more reliable and explainable approach for OOD detection in medical imaging, highlighting its potential for improving diagnostic decision-making.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: The challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with medical imaging data for effective medical report generation and addressing the lack of precision in existing methods.

Method: The authors designed MRG-LLM, a system that integrates a frozen LLM with a visual encoder, and employs dynamic prompt customization via conditional affine transformations derived from image features. Two implementations were proposed: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization.

Result: Experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets showed that MRG-LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating medical reports from imaging data.

Conclusion: MRG-LLM demonstrates that multimodal LLMs with tailored prompt customization can significantly enhance the quality and precision of automatically generated medical reports.

Abstract: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in
clinical practice. While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in

*Shujia Li,Haiyu Zhang,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenHOI, a framework for generating high-fidelity 4D human-object interaction (HOI) sequences with strong generalization to unseen objects, addressing the challenge of limited 4D HOI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the difficulty of synthesizing 4D human-object interaction sequences due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets, and the need for generalization to unseen objects.

Method: The proposed framework, GenHOI, has two stages: (1) An Object-AnchorNet generates sparse 3D HOI keyframes using available 3D HOI datasets, bypassing the need for large-scale 4D HOI datasets. (2) A Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) is used to interpolate these sparse keyframes into temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences, enhanced by a Contact-Aware Encoder and Contact-Aware HOI Attention mechanisms.

Result: GenHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating robust generalization to unseen objects and generating high-quality 4D HOI sequences.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective solution for synthesizing realistic 4D human-object interactions, achieving strong generalization and fidelity, while eliminating dependency on large-scale 4D datasets.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called CLAIM for better myocardial scar segmentation using LGE MRI, featuring realistic scar synthesis guided by clinical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability and variability of high-quality LGE images for myocardial scar segmentation hinder the development of robust models.

Method: CLAIM integrates the SMILE module, a clinically-guided generator based on the AHA 17-segment model for scar synthesis, and uses joint training for scar synthesis and segmentation.

Result: CLAIM achieves anatomically consistent scar synthesis and improved segmentation accuracy compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework enables realistic myocardial scar synthesis, improves downstream medical imaging tasks, and enhances segmentation reliability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WinWinLay is a novel, training-free method to improve layout-to-image generation by addressing issues of imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts, using Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome existing challenges in layout-to-image generation, particularly imprecise localization of elements and the presence of unrealistic artifacts in images generated by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: The paper proposes two strategies: (1) a Non-local Attention Energy Function to counter spatial distribution biases in attention mechanisms and improve layout alignment, and (2) an Adaptive Update scheme based on Langevin dynamics for in-domain updating, avoiding out-of-distribution artifacts.

Result: WinWinLay demonstrates superior control precision and visual realism in layout-to-image generation, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method, WinWinLay, effectively enhances both the precision and realism of layout-to-image generation, setting a new benchmark in the field with its training-free and innovative approach.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised segmentation framework for ultra-high spatial resolution imagery that is environmentally lightweight and enhances segmentation performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address limitations in fine-grained land cover classification for 0.3 m resolution imagery, which suffers from high annotation costs, scale variation issues, and restricted adaptability of large-scale vision models.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework that incorporates the SAM2 knowledge model and introduces the FreqWeaver Adapter, a remote sensing-specific module designed to improve detail modeling while using only 5.96% of the total model parameters.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a 1.78% improvement in segmentation over parameter-efficient techniques and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for high-resolution remote sensing segmentation by 3.44%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively utilizes unlabeled data and maintains a lightweight design to deliver robust segmentation with improved structural consistency for ultra-high spatial resolution imagery.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong performance across diverse datasets, including different leaf conditions (e.g., leaf-on with 20% relative error), spatial scales, and data types (TLS and ULS). It effectively handled low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error).

Conclusion: This scalable and robust approach reduces reliance on specialized preprocessing, supports ULS as a viable TLS alternative, and enables seamless 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales, significantly expanding the applicability of QSM-based AGB estimation in forest management and climate research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [128] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) to improve video super-resolution with high spatial detail and temporal consistency using stable diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Real-VSR methods face a trade-off between maintaining spatial details and temporal consistency, often resulting in suboptimal video quality. A robust method is needed to enhance video restoration without sacrificing either aspect.

Method: The proposed DLoRAL framework employs dual LoRA modules: the Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) for robust temporal representation learning and the Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) for enhancing spatial details. These modules are trained iteratively, alternating between temporal alignment and detail enhancement, using a Cross-Frame Retrieval module for frame information aggregation. Both modules are merged into a stable diffusion model for inference.

Result: DLoRAL demonstrates strong performance in video super-resolution, achieving a balance of high spatial detail and temporal consistency efficiently and accurately. It improves upon existing methods in terms of both quality and computational speed.

Conclusion: The innovative use of dual LoRA modules in DLoRAL advances video super-resolution by simultaneously enhancing spatial details and maintaining temporal consistency. The method is efficient, effective, and sets a new benchmark in the field of Real-VSR.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

### [129] [Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596)
*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M2M-Reg, a novel multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) framework focused on improving alignment between highly heterogeneous medical imaging modalities, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised multi-modal DIR methods struggle due to heterogeneity in imaging modalities (e.g., PET and MRI), causing alignment issues and image distortion. The existing similarity metrics fail to capture alignment between such disparate modalities.

Method: The authors introduce M2M-Reg, a framework utilizing mono-modal similarity metrics for training multi-modal DIR models, and GradCyCon, a regularizer promoting diffeomorphism. The framework supports a semi-supervised approach integrating pre-aligned and unaligned image pairs.

Result: Experiments on the ADNI dataset show that M2M-Reg achieves up to double the DSC performance compared to previous approaches in PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration tasks, demonstrating its robustness in multi-modal DIR.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg addresses the limitations of conventional unsupervised DIR methods in aligning highly heterogeneous modalities, offering improved reliability and compatibility with existing architectures and delivering superior registration outcomes in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Zhirui Gao,Jiazhao Zhang,Yihan Cao,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a new reconstruction-free framework for real-time 3D object detection, designed to be memory-efficient and suitable for open-vocabulary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational and memory challenges posed by existing 3D object detection methods that rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, impacting their viability for real-time tasks.

Method: The paper utilizes streaming posed RGB-D videos with the pre-trained Cubify Anything Foundation Model for single-view 3D detection, enhanced by CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. Detection is unified across multiple views using an association module and optimized with a particle-filtering-based IoU-guided optimization technique.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 3D object detection on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets and demonstrates strong generalization and scalability across large environments.

Conclusion: The research presents a resource-efficient, reconstruction-free approach for 3D object detection, overcoming existing limitations and enabling scalable, real-time applications in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for generating realistic human-object interactions by optimizing noise space with a structured two-phase approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic and physically plausible human-object interactions, which require precise hand-object contact and diverse, natural body motions.

Method: The proposed method, HOIDiNi, uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) to optimize pretrained diffusion model noise space. It separates the problem into an object-centric phase for hand-object contact and a human-centric phase for refining full-body motion.

Result: HOIDiNi achieves superior contact accuracy, physical validity, and motion quality compared to previous methods, as demonstrated on the GRAB dataset. It supports generating various controlled interactions from textual prompts.

Conclusion: The structured approach of HOIDiNi enables realistic and natural human-object interactions, bridging the gap between physical correctness and motion realism.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

### [132] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study finds a paradox where degraded or altered images can improve Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) performance over higher-quality images. A novel lightweight tuning method, VQ-TTT, is introduced to align visual inputs with model-specific preferences, improving accuracy without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored relationship between input visual quality and MLLM performance, challenging the assumption that higher perceptual quality equals better model understanding.

Method: The researchers conducted systematic tests on MLLMs using controlled image degradations and stylistic adjustments, followed by introducing VQ-TTT, a tuning module with frequency modulation and shallow encoder layer fine-tuning using LoRA.

Result: VQ-TTT increased average accuracy across various MLLMs and datasets without requiring external models, cached features, or extra training data.

Conclusion: The concept of universally 'clean' images should be replaced by adaptive visual inputs tailored to the specific preferences of MLLMs, as higher visual fidelity is not necessarily beneficial for their performance.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViMaR, an inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs), improving efficiency and output reliability while reducing hallucinations, achieving a significant speedup and enhancing model generalization and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models face challenges in computational inefficiency and persistent hallucinations due to low-confidence outputs. This paper seeks to improve inference-time search methods by addressing these issues.

Method: The proposed ViMaR framework uses a two-stage approach: identifying high-value captions using a temporal-difference value model and refining weak segments with a margin-based penalty to discourage low-confidence outputs while maintaining descriptive richness.

Result: ViMaR improves caption reliability, accuracy, and detail, achieving over 4× speedup compared to prior methods. It generalizes well across unseen models and enhances model performance on visual comprehension benchmarks when used for self-training.

Conclusion: ViMaR effectively balances efficiency and fidelity in caption generation for VLMs, demonstrates cross-model generalization, and serves as a scalable, modular strategy for enhancing performance in vision-language pipelines.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using video diffusion models to achieve high-quality single-image/video relighting, addressing challenges like data limitations and error accumulation in previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing single-image/video relighting methods, including data scarcity, error accumulation in multi-stage pipelines, and poor generalization under complex lighting and materials.

Method: The authors propose a joint estimation approach integrating albedo estimation and relighting synthesis in one step. They leverage video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world datasets, to enhance scene comprehension and generate realistic effects.

Result: The method demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and outperforms previous approaches in visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves relighting quality by addressing data limitations and enabling realistic lighting and material interactions, showcasing potential for wide applicability in realistic rendering.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Motivation: Existing video generation datasets have limitations such as restricted locations, short clips, static scenes, and lack of exploration-specific annotations, hindering their utility for training world exploration systems.

Method: The authors created Sekai, a dataset with first-person and drone-view videos from over 100 countries. They utilized a custom toolbox for collecting, preprocessing, and annotating the videos with metadata like location, weather, and camera trajectories.

Result: Experimental results validate the quality of the dataset. Additionally, they trained a model named YUME using a subset of Sekai for interactive video world exploration.

Conclusion: The work establishes Sekai as a significant contribution to video generation and exploration studies, enabling advanced applications and research in this field.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ECAD, a genetic algorithm that creates efficient caching schedules for diffusion-based image generation models, improving quality and speed without altering network parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based models generate high-quality images but are slow and computationally expensive during inference, requiring solutions to accelerate their performance.

Method: Developed the ECAD algorithm, which uses genetic programming to generate caching schedules optimized for speed and quality, applicable across various model architectures.

Result: ECAD significantly outperformed previous methods by improving FID scores and inference speeds on multiple benchmarks and diffusion models, showing effective generalization to unseen resolutions and model variants.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable approach to improving diffusion inference, offering customizable quality-speed trade-offs without modifying the models themselves.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hermes, a system that utilizes a Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph) for efficiently handling the resource demands of applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to significant reductions in completion times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems treat resource demands as a blackbox, leading to inefficiencies like improper scheduling and backend latency. This motivated the authors to develop a more precise model for optimizing resource allocation.

Method: The authors propose the PDGraph to model resource demands and apply the Gittins policy for scheduling to reduce average completion time. They also leverage the PDGraph for prewarming backends at the right moment.

Result: Hermes reduces the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80% in experiments with diverse LLM applications.

Conclusion: Hermes demonstrates that understanding and modeling resource demands through PDGraph leads to significant efficiency gains in serving LLM applications.

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'agentic plan caching,' a novel system for reusing structured plan templates in LLM-based agentic applications, significantly reducing costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM applications for complex workflows incur high costs due to intensive planning and reasoning demands. Existing caching methods are insufficient when external data or environmental contexts are factors.

Method: The authors designed 'agentic plan caching,' which extracts plan templates from executed tasks, uses keyword extraction to match new requests to cached plans, and adapts them to task-specific contexts using lightweight models.

Result: Their approach reduced serving costs by 46.62% on average across multiple real-world LLM-based applications, without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching offers an efficient and complementary solution for LLM-based agent serving systems, saving costs while ensuring high-quality outcomes.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to optimize large-scale data analysis using a supplementary dataset for cumulative sums, achieving performance speeds ~10,000x faster than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address computational bottlenecks in analyzing massive multi-dimensional geospatial data, especially for scalable and distributed cloud environments.

Method: The paper proposes generating a small supplementary dataset with cumulative sums along specific dimensions to enable efficient and cost-effective calculations.

Result: The proposed method, tested on AWS, outperformed brute-force approaches with 5% additional storage and was ~10,000 times faster in performance.

Conclusion: By integrating this method, scalable high-performance data analysis becomes feasible, especially for cloud-based systems, significantly reducing computational costs and processing times.

Abstract: Data analysis on massive multi-dimensional data, such as high-resolution
large-region time averaging or area averaging for geospatial data, often
involves calculations over a significant number of data points. While
performing calculations in scalable and flexible distributed or cloud
environments is a viable option, a full scan of large data volumes still serves
as a computationally intensive bottleneck, leading to significant cost. This
paper introduces a generic and comprehensive method to address these
computational challenges. This method generates a small, size-tunable
supplementary dataset that stores the cumulative sums along specific subset
dimensions on top of the raw data. This minor addition unlocks rapid and cheap
high-resolution large-region data analysis, making calculations over large
numbers of data points feasible with small instances or even microservices in
the cloud. This method is general-purpose, but is particularly well-suited for
data stored in chunked, cloud-optimized formats and for services running in
distributed or cloud environments. We present a Zarr extension proposal to
integrate the specifications of this method and facilitate its straightforward
implementation in general-purpose software applications. Benchmark tests
demonstrate that this method, implemented in Amazon Web services (AWS),
significantly outperforms the brute-force approach used in on-premises
services. With just 5% supplemental storage, this method achieves a performance
that is 3-4 orders of magnitude (~10,000 times) faster than the brute-force

### [140] [Parallel Data Object Creation: Towards Scalable Metadata Management in High-Performance I/O Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15114)
*Youjia Li,Robert Latham,Robert Ross,Ankit Agrawal,Alok Choudhary,Wei-Keng Liao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in high-level I/O libraries like PnetCDF and proposes a new scalable file header format that enables independent data object creation, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific applications often require efficient handling of large-scale, parallel I/O tasks. Current libraries struggle with metadata management for numerous, independent data objects, posing challenges for applications processing diverse or remote sensor data.

Method: Using PnetCDF as a platform, the paper introduces a new file header format with an index table referencing metadata blocks. This design allows for independent or collective creation of data objects while adhering to the netCDF format.

Result: The proposed method showed scalable performance, reducing data object creation times by up to 582 times on 4096 MPI processes creating 5,684,800 objects. Memory usage was also optimized, decreasing inversely proportional to the number of processes.

Conclusion: The new file header design dramatically improves scalability and memory efficiency for handling large numbers of independent data objects, solving critical issues in parallel I/O for scientific applications.

Abstract: High-level I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and PnetCDF, are commonly used by
large-scale scientific applications to perform I/O tasks in parallel. These I/O
libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with
the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for
concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large
number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects
independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data
object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes.
Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle
collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different
sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects.
For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object
creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check
increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To
address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we
investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well
as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object
creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and
a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the
metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created
collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance,
cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI
processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new
method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of
memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes.

*Jiale Xu,Rui Zhang,Yi Xiong,Cong Guo,Zihan Liu,Yangjie Zhou,Weiming Hu,Hao Wu,Changxu Shao,Ziqing Wang,Yongjie Yuan,Junping Zhao,Minyi Guo,Jingwen Leng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces eLLM, an elastic memory management framework for serving large language models, aiming to address inefficiencies in memory utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from challenges in managing dynamic memory components, such as activations and KV caches, which impact throughput during LLM serving.

Method: eLLM relies on a Virtual Tensor Abstraction, Elastic Memory Mechanism using CPU buffers, and SLO-aware lightweight scheduling strategies.

Result: Experiments show eLLM outperforms existing systems, achieving 2.32x decoding throughput and supporting significantly larger batch sizes.

Conclusion: eLLM effectively unifies memory management, optimizes utilization, and improves performance for serving large language models in dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving
these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes
static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights
are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV
caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for
efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle
runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory
management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a
page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.
This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory
fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime
memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization
under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.
  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management
framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating
systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,
which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU
memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory
Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory
inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)
a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize
memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under
stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding
throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a RISC-V-based accelerator, Wormhole, for HPC tasks, specifically 2D FFT, comparing its performance and energy efficiency to a Xeon Platinum CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V accelerators in HPC can leverage the open standard for specialization without requiring major ecosystem changes, offering potential power and energy benefits.

Method: Ported the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to Tenstorrent's Wormhole PCIe RISC-V accelerator, evaluated its performance and energy consumption, and explored optimization techniques for data movement bottlenecks.

Result: The Wormhole n300 is slower than a 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU for 2D FFT, but it uses 8 times less power and 2.8 times less energy.

Conclusion: RISC-V accelerators like Wormhole offer significant energy efficiency advantages for HPC tasks despite being slower, presenting a compelling case for specialized computing.

Abstract: Whilst numerous areas of computing have adopted the RISC-V Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) wholesale in recent years, it is yet to become widespread in
HPC. RISC-V accelerators offer a compelling option where the HPC community can
benefit from the specialisation offered by the open nature of the standard but
without the extensive ecosystem changes required when adopting RISC-V CPUs. In
this paper we explore porting the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator. Built upon
Tenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of
data from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer.
Exploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent
in data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is
slower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around
8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when
computing the Fourier transform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of heterogeneous HPC architectures, there is an increasing need to select optimal programming models tailored for specific applications and hardware setups.

Method: The study systematically analyzes MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA based on architectural foundations, performance, domain suitability, and complexity, conducting evaluations across scientific applications.

Result: MPI excels in distributed memory setups but faces communication overhead; OpenMP is effective for shared-memory systems but faces contention; CUDA delivers high GPU performance but requires expertise and is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining these programming models often deliver optimal results for heterogeneous HPC environments, with the choice depending on application needs and hardware constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel
programming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing
Interface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device
Architecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern
heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We
systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural
foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,
programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's
strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation
demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with
near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces
communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and
usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited
by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for
data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires
specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations,
machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining
two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments.
The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best
practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks,
task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data. This research
helps developers and researchers make informed decisions when selecting
programming models for modern HPC applications, emphasizing that the best

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CheckFree and CheckFree+ propose efficient recovery methods for training LLMs on decentralized nodes, avoiding the traditional high-overhead methods of checkpointing and redundant computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce training costs and make large language models (LLMs) more accessible by allowing training on decentralized and low-powered nodes, while addressing the challenges of node churn due to failures.

Method: CheckFree substitutes failing stages of the model with weighted averages of their neighboring stages, avoiding additional computation and storage, and CheckFree+ uses out-of-order pipeline execution and mimicking behavior of neighboring stages to address failures in the first and last stages.

Result: CheckFree and CheckFree+ improve convergence in wall-clock time by over 12% compared to checkpointing and redundant computation in low to medium failure rates (5-10%) for LLaMa models of sizes 124M to 1.5B.

Conclusion: CheckFree and CheckFree+ provide efficient, scalable recovery mechanisms for training LLMs on decentralized nodes, significantly reducing computational and storage overhead compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:

TL;DR: The paper studies the communication cost in parallel computing while multiplying a vector with a 3D symmetric tensor. It derives theoretical lower bounds and presents a tight algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the efficiency in parallel computation of key operations in tensor analysis, such as eigenpair determination and symmetric CP decomposition, by understanding and optimizing communication costs.

Method: The authors extend a geometric inequality for 3D symmetric computations to establish communication lower bounds and design an algorithm based on a triangle block partition scheme.

Result: The paper establishes tight communication lower bounds and provides an optimal algorithm for the specified computation in parallel.

Conclusion: The results highlight the efficiency of using the proposed algorithm for minimizing communication costs in parallel operations with symmetric tensors.

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the parallel communication cost of multiplying
the same vector along two modes of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor. This is
a key computation in the higher-order power method for determining eigenpairs
of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor and in gradient-based methods for
computing a symmetric CP decomposition. We establish communication lower bounds
that determine how much data movement is required to perform the specified
computation in parallel. The core idea of the proof relies on extending a key
geometric inequality for $3$-dimensional symmetric computations. We demonstrate
that the communication lower bounds are tight by presenting an optimal
algorithm where the data distribution is a natural extension of the triangle
block partition scheme for symmetric matrices to 3-dimensional symmetric
tensors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU dispatching system that improves GPU bandwidth efficacy in heterogeneous GPU clusters by up to 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU dispatching systems, which rely on physical proximity of GPUs, are limited in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where interconnect bandwidth is irregular.

Method: LiteGD employs a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled data to handle massive GPU topology information and uses a bidirectional tree search to optimize GPU dispatching.

Result: Experimental results show LiteGD achieves 90% bandwidth efficacy in simulated clusters and 80% in real-world H100 clusters, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: LiteGD provides a scalable and efficient GPU dispatching system, particularly effective for large-scale and heterogeneous configurations, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for
machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To
reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for
parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity.
However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in
large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs
is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU
dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of
storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware
design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled
data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability
and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to
find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step,
which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We
implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with
homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results
demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy
(approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in
real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and
interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale
heterogeneous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete data, and ambiguities, necessitating better tools for support.

Method: A hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, incorporates multi-step dialogues between physicians and LLMs to refine diagnoses and treatment suggestions.

Result: Simulated interactions indicate open-source LLMs can effectively assist physicians in decision-making.

Conclusion: MedSyn demonstrates potential for improving diagnostic accuracy via physician-LLM collaboration; future research will validate it in real settings.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

*Jiyi Wang,Jingyang Ke,Bo Dai,Anqi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SKIL, a reinforcement learning framework for interpreting animal behavior that focuses on compositional representations rather than discrete segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods oversimplified animal behavior modeling by relying on restrictive assumptions about discrete components, which do not capture the dynamic nature of behavior generation.

Method: The proposed method, SKIL, uses reinforcement learning with latent basis functions derived from transition probabilities and parameterizes policies as mixtures of these skills.

Result: SKIL effectively identifies reusable skill components, learns compositional policies, and outperforms traditional discrete models in generating realistic trajectories.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled explanation of complex animal behaviors as dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives, enhancing understanding and predictive modeling.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional parallel tempering (2D-PT) algorithm to improve mixing and constraint enforcement in Ising model-based optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently sample Boltzmann distributions for optimization problems is complicated by soft constraints in practical implementations of Ising machines.

Method: The paper extends the parallel tempering algorithm by adding a second dimension of replicas that interpolate penalty strengths, improving constraint satisfaction and mixing performance.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-ideal mixing in graph sparsification tasks with constrained replicas, displaying significant speedup and reduced divergence compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: 2D-PT enhances constrained Ising problem solving, simplifies penalty tuning, and can be implemented on existing hardware for real-world applications.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

TL;DR: This paper explores the automatic definition of thresholds for anomaly detection systems using Autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defining a robust threshold for reconstruction error significantly affects the performance of anomaly detection systems, and current methods are non-trivial and non-standardized.

Method: The authors propose using machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, and Support Vector Machine, to automatically define the threshold for anomaly detection.

Result: Three machine learning algorithms were evaluated for their effectiveness in automatically defining thresholds.

Conclusion: Automatic threshold definition using ML algorithms can potentially improve anomaly detection system performance by bypassing intrinsic data-related issues like imbalance.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in clinical trials datasets, such as stability and interpretability, by integrating AI capabilities to uncover meaningful patterns and enhance predictions.

Method: They use NetraAI to contract feature spaces into stable attractors forming latent subgroups, leveraging evolutionary algorithms and LLMs to inject domain knowledge and prioritize high-potential features.

Result: NetraAI demonstrated transformational predictive power in case studies on schizophrenia, depression, and pancreatic cancer, significantly improving baseline classifiers using minimal features.

Conclusion: The paper suggests NetraAI's approach could redefine adaptive AI in clinical discovery, offering reliable and interpretable models for small datasets by merging dynamic systems and LLM insights.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

*Flavio Martinelli,Alexander Van Meegen,Berfin Şimşek,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates special structures in neural network loss landscapes, called 'channels,' which lead to gated linear unit emergence through gradient flow optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and characterize quasi-flat regions in the loss landscapes of neural networks, particularly where neurons exhibit specific behaviors like diverging weights and forming functional units.

Method: The authors analyzed the geometry, gradient dynamics, and functionality of loss landscapes, highlighting channels leading to gated linear units. They used gradient-based solvers like SGD and ADAM to study these phenomena.

Result: The study found that gradient flows naturally lead to these specific channels where neuron weights diverge and converge to symmetry-induced critical points, forming gated linear units.

Conclusion: The research reveals the computational significance of fully connected layers and explains the appearance of quasi-flat regions in neural network optimization.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of decoding natural language from brain activity in an open-vocabulary context, where traditional EEG methods struggle with noise, variability, and limited vocabularies.

Method: The study proposes the ETS framework, which integrates EEG signals with synchronized eye-tracking data to support open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification tasks.

Result: The model demonstrated better scores in BLEU, Rouge, and F1 metrics, outperforming existing supervised baselines in both text generation and ternary sentiment classification.

Conclusion: The novel strategy of combining EEG with eye-tracking data is effective for open-vocabulary language decoding, proving its generalizability across different subjects and datasets.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities, reducing risks of data loss and optimizing maintenance costs, aiding in intelligent decision-making for reliable cloud and edge storage systems.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

*Ethan Mulle,Wei Kang,Qi Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called HiPreNets to improve neural network accuracy by refining staged training techniques, focusing on $L^{\\infty}$ error instead of just minimizing MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with accuracy in complex problems due to non-convex optimization and hyperparameter issues, while traditional methods often neglect $L^{\\infty}$ error, crucial for many applications.

Method: The paper proposes a progressive framework for refining neural networks by sequentially improving prediction residuals with additional networks, optimizing loss functions, and employing adaptive data sampling techniques.

Result: The framework was validated through benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing neural network accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPreNets offer a structured and adaptive method to train high-precision neural networks, addressing limitations in traditional approaches and improving overall accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

### [158] [Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14784)
*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a transfer learning approach using convolutional neural networks to predict onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed, as an alternative to direct measurements that can fail due to sensor issues. It focuses on adaptability to changes in data distribution and prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of determining onflow parameters through direct measurements face challenges related to sensor faults. A data-driven, fast-learning prediction model is essential for practical applications like wind tunnel monitoring and aerodynamic performance assessment.

Method: A transfer learning framework is developed involving a pre-trained convolutional neural network (ConvNet) whose layers are selectively retrained based on the specific prediction task. This method is tested under scenarios like domain adaptation, task adaptation, and sensitivity to noisy data.

Result: The method demonstrated success in adapting to new data distributions, extending applicable domains, and switching between prediction tasks. However, its performance on noisy data was less effective.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning approach shows promise for practical applications requiring adaptability to changing data distributions and tasks, though noise handling remains an area for improvement.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PIPE, a method enhancing multimodal time series forecasting by embedding physical information into vision language models, achieving superior accuracy in typhoon intensity forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal time series forecasting by addressing the underutilization of visual data such as satellite imagery, while effectively capturing physical information embedded in geospatial and temporal contexts.

Method: This paper proposes two key innovations: a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physical information to positional IDs, and a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism to encode physical variables and sequence information within embeddings.

Result: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, with a notable 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting on a large open-source satellite image dataset.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively enhances multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy by preserving physical and sequential order information, thus demonstrating its value in deep learning and climate science domains.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in variational inference when handling multimodal distributions and proposes an enhancement of the classical Stein Variational Gradient Descent.

Method: BSVGD employs a random branching mechanism to enhance state space exploration, and convergence in distribution is theoretically guaranteed. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm's performance.

Result: The BSVGD algorithm outperformed SVGD in terms of Wasserstein distance and computational efficiency, showcasing its robustness and practicality.

Conclusion: BSVGD enhances multimodal distribution analysis with theoretical backing and better performance compared to SVGD, emphasizing exploration and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a novel particle-based variational inference method designed to
work with multimodal distributions. Our approach, referred to as Branched Stein
Variational Gradient Descent (BSVGD), extends the classical Stein Variational
Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by incorporating a random branching mechanism
that encourages the exploration of the state space. In this work, a theoretical
guarantee for the convergence in distribution is presented, as well as
numerical experiments to validate the suitability of our algorithm. Performance
comparisons between the BSVGD and the SVGD are presented using the Wasserstein
distance between samples and the corresponding computational times.

*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Transformer to address retrieval challenges in multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS), effectively reducing retrieval tardiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of lane blockages during retrieval operations in multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage systems, which current methods fail to tackle while maintaining flexibility in heterogeneous item configurations.

Method: The method incorporates a graph-based state representation paired with a novel neural network combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformers to prioritize item retrieval based on an objective to minimize tardiness.

Result: The proposed model outperforms heuristic methods in numerical experiments, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability to varied storage layouts.

Conclusion: The deep reinforcement learning approach effectively reduces retrieval tardiness in multi-deep storage systems, offering a flexible and efficient solution applicable to diverse warehouse configurations.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of publicly available, comprehensive datasets for type 1 diabetes management hinders advancements in personalized therapy, glucose prediction models, and digital twin systems.

Method: AZT1D was developed by collecting 6-8 weeks of continuous glucose, insulin pump, carbohydrate intake, and device mode data from 25 T1D patients. Granular details, such as bolus insulin delivery specifics, are included.

Result: AZT1D offers a unique, detailed dataset with rarely available features that support AI and machine learning applications for clinical decision-making in T1D.

Conclusion: Providing high-quality, detailed, and naturalistic datasets like AZT1D will significantly advance research and innovation in T1D management.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [163] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) method to tackle recurring concept drift in time series, enhancing online prediction accuracy by retaining and utilizing conceptual knowledge effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of declining prediction accuracy caused by recurring concept drift in time series, where previously observed data patterns reappear but are often forgotten.

Method: The CEP mechanism retains forecasters for various concepts in a pool. It selects and updates forecasters according to new data, adds new models for emerging concepts, and eliminates outdated knowledge.

Result: CEP shows strong effectiveness in retaining and utilizing knowledge across different concepts, significantly improving online forecasting results in eight real datasets.

Conclusion: CEP provides a practical solution for recurring concept drift, improving the accuracy and adaptability of online predictors in dynamic data environments.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a novel technique for enhancing zero-shot performance of Protein Language Models (PLMs) using dropout during inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein Language Models (PLMs) have exhibited strong zero-shot capabilities in predicting protein fitness, but there is room to improve their performance without retraining or finetuning.

Method: The authors propose injecting a dropout layer at inference time between the embedding layer and the transformer in the PLM, leveraging Monte-Carlo dropout to average outputs.

Result: Using a dropout rate of 0.1 improved zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset for various PLMs, irrespective of whether they were trained with dropouts.

Conclusion: Inference-time dropout is a simple and effective method to enhance PLMs' prediction accuracy on protein-related datasets without any additional training.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE), a method to efficiently create new models by interpolating weights from pre-trained Mixture-of-Experts models, enabling functional variant creation with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs per 8-bit weight. There is a need for more efficient methods to utilize such investments.

Method: The proposed AoE method interpolates individual weights from Mixture-of-Experts models to create new "child" models. This is achieved in linear time without requiring fine-tuning or distillation.

Result: Using AoE, the authors created the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B hybrid model. It maintains the intelligence of one parent model while being nearly as fast as another and uses 40% fewer output tokens.

Conclusion: AoE facilitates the efficient creation of robust and capable new models from existing pre-trained ones, offering a promising way to leverage expensive computational investments.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenges of online Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), introducing an event-driven framework with dynamic local regret (DLR) to handle non-stationary and asynchronous data, achieving stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced in online VFL, particularly in scenarios where clients have disjoint feature sets and unsynchronized data streams, which were overlooked by prior work.

Method: The authors proposed an event-driven online VFL framework where a subset of clients are activated during events, integrating dynamic local regret (DLR) analysis to handle non-convex models in non-stationary environments.

Result: The framework proved to be more stable than existing solutions under non-stationary conditions and notably reduced both communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: The event-driven online VFL framework with DLR effectively addresses the challenges of asynchronous and non-stationary data in online VFL, making it a more practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

### [167] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics for pretraining large language models and finds an optimal adjustment to the learning rates related to embedding and hidden layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expensive to pretrain, and efficient parametrization methods like Maximal Update Parametrization (μP) exhibit inconsistencies for LLMs, particularly due to vocabulary size being generally larger than model width.

Method: The study presents a theoretical analysis of training dynamics considering varying vocabulary sizes and introduces a new Large Vocab (LV) regime with different optimal scaling rules for learning rates. Several experiments, including pretraining a 1B model, were conducted to validate the theory.

Result: The analysis showed that in the LV regime, the optimal learning rate ratio for embedding to hidden layers scales as Θ(√width) rather than μP's Θ(width). Experiments validated this finding and demonstrated benefits for pretraining.

Conclusion: The paper refines the understanding of learning rate scaling in the context of large vocabulary sizes, offering practical improvements for training large-scale models.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

TL;DR: This paper derives a universal tradeoff between generalization and identification in intelligent systems based on representational similarity, validated across simple and complex machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental limitations of how intelligent systems simultaneously generalize broadly while preserving input identity.

Method: Theoretical analysis of representational similarity leading to closed-form expressions for generalization and identification probabilities, supported by experiments with simple neural networks and complex architectures like CNNs and vision-language models.

Result: A universal Pareto front between generalization and identification is revealed, with phenomena like $1/n$ processing capacity collapse and a non-monotonic optimum confirmed both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity is a universal informational constraint that governs the representational capacity of both artificial and biological systems, with implications for deep learning and cognitive science.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes the Muon optimizer, connecting it with the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family and showing that Muon implicitly enforces spectral norm constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer has shown empirical success, but its theoretical foundation is underexplored, necessitating deeper understanding and conceptual connections.

Method: Muon is positioned within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ optimizer family using the nuclear norm, and results from Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ are used to dissect Muon's implicit regularization properties.

Result: Muon is found to implicitly enforce spectral norm constraints on weight matrices, opening pathways to generalize by varying the convex map $\mathcal{K}$.

Conclusion: This analysis clarifies Muon's implicit effects and provides a framework for extending it to more constrained and regularized optimization methods.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

*Zuochen Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ss-Mamba is a new time series forecasting model using semantic embeddings and spline-based encoding for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of high computational complexity in traditional Transformer models for time-series forecasting while maintaining performance.

Method: The model integrates selective state-space modeling, semantic index embeddings from pretrained language models, and spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for dynamic temporal encoding.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ss-Mamba achieves improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba is a promising and efficient alternative to Transformer-based models for enhanced time-series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

### [171] [Centroid Approximation for Byzantine-Tolerant Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15264)
*Mélanie Cambus,Darya Melnyk,Tijana Milentijević,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning's robustness to Byzantine behavior is analyzed, presenting new bounds on centroid approximations under validity conditions and new algorithms with experimental evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the robustness of federated learning to Byzantine behavior, given challenges in achieving both convergence and robustness in distributed settings.

Method: Analyzing tradeoffs between validity conditions and average/centroid in federated learning, deriving lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation, presenting a novel algorithm under convex validity, and conducting empirical evaluations.

Result: The work establishes a lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ and an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$ for centroid approximation. It also introduces an algorithm achieving $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation with tight lower bounds.

Conclusion: Federated learning can achieve robust performance with theoretical guarantees on centroid approximation bounds and is validated by empirical results, providing insights for handling Byzantine scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

*Yikai Hou,Peng Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) for traffic data imputation, blending tensor algebra with neural learning, and proves its effectiveness against other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of pervasive missing data in traffic analysis due to sensor failures and gaps, which hampers reliable modeling of traffic patterns.

Method: The paper embeds CP decomposition into a neural architecture, using learnable embeddings and hierarchical feature fusion through Hadamard products, followed by multilayer perceptron layers for refining spatiotemporal traffic data representations.

Result: NCPF outperforms six state-of-the-art models across six urban traffic datasets in terms of traffic data imputation.

Conclusion: By integrating the interpretability of CP factorization with neural networks' expressive power, NCPF provides a robust and flexible framework for traffic data imputation, aiding modern traffic systems and digital twin implementations.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

### [173] [Heavy-Ball Momentum Method in Continuous Time and Discretization Error Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14806)
*Bochen Lyu,Xiaojing Zhang,Fangyi Zheng,He Wang,Zheng Wang,Zhanxing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a continuous-time model for the Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method that explicitly accounts for discretization error and demonstrates its theoretical and numerical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between discrete HB momentum dynamics and their continuous-time approximations caused by discretization error, thereby enhancing understanding and utility in gradient-based optimization methods.

Method: The authors design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation by adding counter terms that explicitly control the discretization error, allowing for higher-order accuracy in the step size.

Result: They provide a mathematical model that better bridges the discrete and continuous frameworks for HB momentum, uncover implicit biases in certain linear networks, and validate results through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This refined continuous-time approximation of the HB momentum method enhances understanding of implicit regularization and offers useful tools for optimization methods, with potential applications in deep learning.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients is explored using FLAIR images, employing centralized, federated, and single-site learning models. Federated learning showed promise while avoiding data centralization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns limit the availability of large datasets required for training robust BrainAGE models. This study aims to evaluate federated learning's capability in estimating BrainAGE and its associations with clinical phenotypes and outcomes.

Method: FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 centers were used. BrainAGE predictions were generated through centralized, FL-based, and single-site learning approaches. Prediction errors, vascular risk associations, and functional recovery outcomes were analyzed.

Result: Centralized learning provided the best performance, but FL consistently outperformed single-site models. Higher BrainAGE levels correlated with diabetes mellitus. BrainAGE was significantly associated with functional recovery outcomes.

Conclusion: FL allows accurate BrainAGE estimation while preserving privacy. BrainAGE's predictive associations with risk factors and recovery suggest its utility in stroke prognostic modeling.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

*Alejandro Francisco Queiruga,Theo Gutman-Solo,Shuai Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper rigorously evaluates machine learning methods on a 1D Poisson equation, demonstrating theoretical and empirical limits to generalization in scientific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the importance of ensuring quantitative accuracy in scientific machine learning models, especially when addressing differential equations.

Method: Apply numerical analysis to evaluate generalization bounds, derive optimal parameters, and assess various ML approaches including white-box methods, black-box models, and neural operators.

Result: The generalization behaviors of different models do not guarantee convergence to the true physical equation, and opposing behaviors are observed across model classes.

Conclusion: New insights on mechanistic interpretability and a proposed benchmarking cross-validation technique for scientific ML models are provided.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Jenny Schmalfuss,Nadine Chang,Vibashan VS,Maying Shen,Andres Bruhn,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores prompt sensitivity in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and introduces a framework called PARC for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VLMs inherit prompt sensitivity from language models and identify the impact of variations in prompts on their performance.

Method: A framework named PARC is proposed, consisting of plausible prompt variations, reliability scoring, and calibration to analyze prompt sensitivity in VLMs.

Result: PARC reveals that VLMs exhibit language prompt sensitivity in vision tasks; destructive variations significantly affect output, and InternVL2 models show robust performance.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity in VLMs is influenced by training data, and InternVL2 models demonstrate strong resilience to variations. The framework PARC aids in systematic analysis.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Model-Router framework that adapts to sparse and intermittent demand patterns in supply chains, improving forecasting accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of sparse and intermittent demand forecasting, which causes frequent zero-demand periods and hampers inventory management.

Method: The proposed Model-Router framework dynamically selects the optimal forecasting model (classical, ML, or DL) for each product based on its demand type using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers.

Result: Using the Favorita dataset, the approach shows up to an 11.8% improvement in forecasting accuracy (NWRMSLE) and 4.67x faster inference time compared to single-model benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances forecasting precision, reducing stockouts and excess inventory, and highlights the value of adaptive AI in supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve interpretability in comparing time series by emphasizing broader structural relationships rather than point-to-point alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series comparison methods focus mostly on quantitative aspects using elastic distance measures, lacking qualitative approaches that visually highlight structural relationships between subsequences.

Method: The authors propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to visualize and quantify transformations such as shifts, compressions, and amplitude differences.

Result: The proposed technique offers improved visualization of how subsequences correspond between time series, enabling users to better interpret their broader structural relationships.

Conclusion: The method enhances the interpretability of time series comparison by focusing on qualitative visual insights, aiding in understanding transformations between series.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and interference when applying neural networks in continual reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: Proposes a modular neural network architecture that grows linearly with tasks while selectively combining past policies to enhance learning. Experiments on control and visual tasks validate the method.

Result: The approach demonstrated better knowledge transfer and outperformed alternative methods on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: This growable architecture ensures scalable learning and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, striking a balance between scaling and maintaining plasticity.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that
naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual
reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective
combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents LIT-LVM, a method to estimate coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors using latent low-dimensional representations, showing better prediction accuracy over established methods like elastic net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors, especially in high-dimensional settings, where overfitting is a concern.

Method: The method introduces low-dimensional latent vector representations for features to impose structured regularization, reducing overfitting beyond traditional methods like the lasso and elastic net.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines in simulations and diverse real-world datasets, especially in settings with a high ratio of interaction terms to sample size.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM improves prediction accuracy, mitigates overfitting, and offers interpretable latent representations, making it a valuable tool for both predictive modeling and feature analysis.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

TL;DR: The paper simplifies the analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for linear regression using basic linear algebra tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to make the theoretical understanding of SGD optimization in linear regression more accessible, addressing limitations in the complexity of prior analyses.

Method: They adopt simplified linear algebra techniques to analyze bias-variance decomposition of SGD risk, avoiding challenging operations with PSD matrices.

Result: Their approach reproduces the sharp bias and variance bounds previously established by Zou et al. but with simpler analytical tools.

Conclusion: This simplified framework could aid in developing further improvements for SGD, such as mini-batching and learning rate schedules, enhancing its practicality in training more realistic models.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

TL;DR: This paper explores using biomarkers from 3D optical images and machine learning models to predict body composition variables like ALM, BFP, and BMD as an alternative to DXA scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA scans for measuring body composition are costly and time-intensive, prompting the need for more accessible alternatives using data from 3D optical images.

Method: The paper proposes a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model and evaluates it alongside supervised models like SVR and LSSVR for predicting ALM, BFP, and BMD using data from 847 patients.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model achieved prediction errors of ~13% for ALM, ~10% for BMD, and ~20% for BFP with limited data. SVR and LSSVR performed better with more data, achieving errors of ~8-11% for various metrics.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian model is a promising tool for healthcare applications in data-limited settings, while supervised methods excel with extensive training data.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges faced by vision-language models (VLMs) in performing detailed visual reasoning tasks, especially under limited compute resources.

Method: A combination of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with external tools such as zoom, along with a simple reward structure, a streamlined tool-calling interface, additional tokens for tool-call results, and tailored training data emphasizing visually difficult examples.

Result: Improved performance in visual question-answering (VQA) tasks compared to baseline models of similar size by leveraging detailed visual information from the external tool.

Conclusion: The integration of GRPO learning and external tools enhances the reasoning capabilities of smaller-scale VLMs, demonstrating a viable path for improving visual reasoning under resource constraints.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Method: A framework consisting of server-centralized LLMs and NanoEdge modules for lightweight client-side adaptations, reducing storage and communication needs.

Result: FedNano achieves substantial storage reduction (95%) and communication overhead reduction (0.01%), demonstrating superior performance compared to existing FL methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging its design, FedNano enables feasible and efficient deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models in decentralized Federated Learning scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four surrogate modeling techniques for predicting material properties of high-entropy alloys, finding that Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) infused with machine-learning priors outperform others in handling complex and incomplete datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) by leveraging surrogate models that integrate computational predictions with sparse experimental data.

Method: The paper evaluates four surrogate models—conventional Gaussian Processes (cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost—using a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties from the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system.

Result: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP), specifically with machine-learning-based priors, outperformed other models by effectively capturing property correlations and handling input-dependent uncertainty in a challenging dataset.

Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of advanced hierarchical surrogate models like DGP in achieving robust, accurate, and data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CACTUS, a tool designed for improving early-stage classification and explainability in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) diagnosis, outperforming traditional ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of existing ML models in healthcare, such as reliance on large, complete datasets and lack of transparency, specifically for diagnosing AMD, a condition requiring accurate early classification.

Method: The authors developed CACTUS, which integrates genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors to improve AMD stage classification while providing explainability and reducing bias.

Result: CACTUS demonstrated better performance compared to standard ML models, enhancing classification decisions and identifying important features aligned with medical knowledge.

Conclusion: CACTUS enhances diagnostic precision and explainability for AMD, offering a tool that is both effective and trustworthy in clinical settings.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

*Jenni Raitoharju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced kernel for One-Class SVM that uses some negative samples to improve its performance, outperforming traditional methods, especially when negative samples are sparse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve small-scale one-class classification tasks, especially when only a limited number of negative samples are available, as existing methods do not effectively utilize this scenario.

Method: The study introduces the Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg), which modifies the kernel in One-Class SVM to incorporate negative data, without altering the original optimization process.

Result: The proposed GRKneg method outperforms the standard OC-SVM with Radial Basis Function kernel. It also surpasses binary SVM in cases where negative samples are minimal.

Conclusion: GRKneg enhances the performance of OC-SVM by using limited negative samples and offers superior results over binary SVM and standard OC-SVM in specific scenarios.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedOne, a framework that enhances query efficiency in federated black-box discrete prompt learning for cloud-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on federated black-box prompt tuning overlooked the high query cost of using cloud-based LLM services.

Method: FedOne framework activates only one client per round in federated learning, optimizing query efficiency while tuning discrete prompts.

Result: Numerical experiments validate the framework, showing improved query efficiency and alignment with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: FedOne achieves optimal query efficiency in federated black-box discrete prompt learning and advances the feasibility of cloud-based LLM tuning.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

TL;DR: This paper presents Guru, a reinforcement learning (RL) corpus for training large language models (LLMs) in six broad reasoning domains, showcasing improved capabilities across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited focus of existing RL efforts in improving LLM reasoning beyond math and coding, and to understand RL's broader applicability by creating diverse, reliable signals for multitask reasoning.

Method: The authors created Guru, a curated RL corpus with 92K examples in six reasoning domains using domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering processes, enabling detailed evaluations of RL training methodologies.

Result: Their findings reveal that domains frequently seen during LLM pretraining (e.g., Math, Code, Science) benefit from cross-domain RL, while sparsely pretrained domains (e.g., Logic, Simulation) require in-domain training. They also develop two Guru models, setting new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks in open RL-trained models.

Conclusion: Guru demonstrates how RL can lead to effective general-purpose reasoning skills through both cross-domain and in-domain training, with shared resources released to advance the field.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD), an improved method for estimating machine learning model errors under distribution shifts, addressing key issues with prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating the error of machine learning models in unseen domains under distribution shifts is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety in practical deployments.

Method: The authors identify issues in prior error estimation methods and propose ODD, which considers disagreement only in non-overlapping target regions, removing competition in overlapping regions. They use domain classifiers for better domain overlap estimation.

Result: ODD demonstrates superior error prediction compared to the previous DIS^2 approach across diverse benchmarks, reducing estimation errors while remaining valid and reliable.

Conclusion: ODD successfully improves the estimation error of ML models under distribution shifts and provides a practical, robust mechanism for predictive performance assessment.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper studies hallucinations in large language model (LLM)-based embodied agents during complex tasks, showcasing their difficulty in resolving scene-task inconsistencies and proposing insights for improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the frequent hallucinations experienced by LLM-based embodied agents when dealing with physically ungrounded tasks, especially during long-horizon tasks.

Method: Constructed a hallucination probing set based on an existing benchmark to examine hallucination rates, evaluated 12 models in two simulation environments, and analyzed behaviors under different scene-task inconsistencies.

Result: Models displayed reasoning capabilities but failed to address scene-task inconsistencies, with hallucination rates up to 40x higher than normal, exposing limitations in managing infeasible tasks.

Conclusion: LLM-based embodied agents struggle with hallucinations during inconsistent tasks. The paper offers actionable guidance for improving model robustness in navigation and planning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

TL;DR: The paper explores using advanced models and multimodal approaches to predict multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression, demonstrating improved results by integrating clinical and digital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of predicting disability progression in MS, which is difficult due to the disease’s heterogeneity, by leveraging sparse baseline clinical and richer digital data.

Method: The study utilized state-of-the-art machine learning and transformer-based models, including unimodal and multimodal approaches, to integrate clinical and digital data for improving prediction accuracy.

Result: Incorporating digital data with advanced transformers improved prediction outcomes compared to clinical data alone. The multimodal transformer consistently performed better, confirming the benefits of combining data sources.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of multimodal and foundation models for analyzing diverse clinical and digital datasets, promising enhanced prognostics for MS and other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness among agents while optimizing system performance, particularly when rewards are uncertain and information is limited.

Method: The authors propose a probing framework for strategic information gathering and present a greedy algorithm for offline settings and an online algorithm that balances fairness with sublinear regret.

Result: Experimental findings demonstrate superior fairness and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to existing approaches, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework and algorithms provide a robust solution to the challenge of fair resource allocation in multi-agent systems, achieving strong theoretical and empirical performance.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for stable and clinically meaningful reinforcement learning policies for sepsis treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome training instability in learning state representations from ICU time series for effective sepsis treatment RL.

Method: CDE-based state representations with stabilization methods and acuity-aware regularization using clinical scores.

Result: Stable CDE representations correlated with clinical acuity scores and superior RL policy performance on sepsis data.

Conclusion: Training stability is crucial for using CDEs in clinical RL, enabling robust policy formation and acuity-aware state representation.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFT-GO, a method to improve supervised fine-tuning of large language models by adapting token importance in training, showing superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning approaches for LLMs treat all tokens equally, overlooking that certain tokens carry more critical task-specific information.

Method: The authors propose SFT-GO, which groups tokens based on their importance and uses a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss to optimize learning.

Result: SFT-GO consistently outperforms baseline fine-tuning methods across various benchmarks, datasets, and base models, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy.

Conclusion: The study proves both theoretically and empirically that SFT-GO enhances learning dynamics and achieves better alignment of LLMs with human expectations and specific tasks.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is critical for tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization but remains computationally expensive and time-intensive, motivating the need for more efficient methods.

Method: SPG is a trajectory generation framework inspired by DeepSeek-V3 that uses temporary modules to extend the base model and generate state-action trajectories in one forward pass, contrasting traditional policy gradient methods.

Result: SPG consistently improves model performance across five datasets, including ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, and SUPERB, with gains ranging from 0.2% to 7% while requiring significantly less computational expense.

Conclusion: SPG offers an efficient and effective approach for hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating widespread applicability across domains and models, and is backed by open-source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is a critical but underexplored challenge in the domain of machine unlearning, necessary for privacy, security, and compliance purposes.

Method: The paper categorizes existing verification techniques into behavioral and parametric approaches, analyzing their evidence types, strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities.

Result: A systematic taxonomy is proposed along with the evaluation of representative methods, highlighting gaps and areas for improvement in current verification mechanisms.

Conclusion: A set of open problems is presented to guide the development of more robust and theoretically grounded unlearning verification methodologies.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

TL;DR: ImprovDML is a decentralized framework that improves model accuracy while ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks in distributed machine learning (DML).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions integrating Byzantine-resilient rules with differential privacy mechanisms often lead to reduced model accuracy, necessitating a better framework.

Method: The framework utilizes a resilient vector consensus algorithm for aggregation and introduces multivariate Gaussian noise to gradients for privacy preservation.

Result: ImprovDML achieves tighter asymptotic error bounds, offers convergence guarantees in non-convex settings, and demonstrates improved privacy-accuracy trade-offs compared to differential privacy.

Conclusion: ImprovDML successfully merges resilience, privacy preservation, and high accuracy, validated theoretically and via numerical simulations.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods introduce challenges like inference-time latency, suboptimal convergence, and fixed rank limitations, making them less ideal for adapting large language models.

Method: The proposed SoKA method combines SVD-driven initialization with Kronecker-product tensor factorization and dynamic rank selection, leveraging criteria like energy thresholds and elbow points to prune unnecessary components.

Result: On evaluations with LLaMA2-7B, SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters—25% fewer than existing methods like LoRA—while matching or exceeding their performance and achieving faster convergence and stable gradients.

Conclusion: SoKA provides a robust and efficient solution for adapting large models, offering lower parameter requirements, faster training convergence, and improved stability without sacrificing task performance.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a method using synthetic data generation to address limitations in Dataset Inference (DI) for identifying copyright violations concerning Large Language Model training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the need to address unauthorized dataset usage in training Large Language Models, which often disrespect intellectual property rights. Existing DI methods require unavailable held-out data, creating an obstacle for practical application.

Method: The method involves synthetic data generation via a suffix-based completion task combined with post-hoc calibration to bridge likelihood gaps between real and synthetic datasets, enabling accurate DI application.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that synthetic held-out data can effectively identify original training datasets with high confidence and low false-positive rates across various text datasets.

Conclusion: This approach offers a reliable solution for copyright owners to verify data usage and supports real-world litigation regarding intellectual property violations in dataset training for LLMs.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

### [202] [DOVA-PATBM: An Intelligent, Adaptive, and Scalable Framework for Optimizing Large-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15289)
*Chuan Li,Shunyu Zhao,Vincent Gauthier,Hassine Moungla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM offers a geo-computational framework for optimizing EV charger deployment across diverse geographical contexts, ensuring equitable access and computational scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising adoption of battery-electric vehicles necessitates scalable and data-rich planning tools for charger infrastructure across varied geographical areas, including cities and rural corridors.

Method: The framework uses a hierarchical H3 grid for data integration, applies a graph neural network centrality model to identify key intersections, utilizes Voronoi tessellation for charger placement, and employs M/M/c queuing for optimizing port sizes under constraints.

Result: When applied to Georgia, USA, it improves 30 km tile coverage by 12%, reduces low-income residents' travel distances by half, and adheres to power limitations for scalability.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM effectively merges geo-computational modeling with practical deployment needs, bridging academic optimization techniques with real-world infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led supply chain finance in cross-border e-commerce, leveraging advanced AI models like QRGMM and DeepFM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of cross-border e-commerce provides opportunities for SMEs but highlights the challenge of securing financing due to their limited credit histories.

Method: The framework uses Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) for predicting sales distributions and integrates it with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) for handling complex e-commerce data.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in credit risk assessment and determining appropriate loan sizes through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of generative AI in managing risk for cross-border e-commerce financing, potentially improving credit practices and SMEs' access to loans.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

*Jinglong Luo,Zhuo Zhang,Yehong Zhang,Shiyu Liu,Ye Dong,Xun Zhou,Hui Wang,Yue Yu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SecFwT, an MPC-based framework improving the efficiency and privacy of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require fine-tuning for specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, but privacy requirements and computational challenges prevent effective use of traditional methods.

Method: The authors propose SecFwT, which avoids backward and optimizer computations through a forward-only tuning paradigm and replaces the softmax-based attention mechanism with a Random Feature Attention approach optimized for MPC.

Result: SecFwT achieves greater efficiency in computation, effective privacy preservation, and scalability for fine-tuning LLMs in privacy-critical applications.

Conclusion: SecFwT overcomes core barriers in MPC-enabled private LLM fine-tuning, paving the way for secure deployment of such models in sensitive fields.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured active learning framework using Seq2Seq VAE for drug design optimized for multiple therapeutic targets, addressing sparse rewards and conflicting constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of designing molecules simultaneously optimized for multiple therapeutic targets due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints in drug discovery.

Method: The method integrates a structured active learning paradigm, involving a sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder, to iteratively expand latent space and constrain molecules within stringent docking thresholds.

Result: In a case study targeting three coronavirus main proteases, the framework efficiently generated diverse candidates for pan-inhibitors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances exploration of beneficial chemical space, providing a generalizable strategy for addressing multi-objective drug design challenges.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

*Yingcong Li,Xiangyu Chang,Muti Kara,Xiaofeng Liu,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how in-context learning (ICL) leverages mislabeled or missing label demonstrations, providing a theoretical framework for understanding its mechanisms, particularly with transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve ICL performance in scenarios with missing or incorrect labels, specifically within semi-supervised learning frameworks.

Method: A theoretical analysis using binary Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and studying loss landscapes of different model architectures (linear vs. multilayer/looped transformers). Empirical evaluations examine how looping enhances semi-supervised tabular model learning.

Result: Linear attention models fail with missing labels whereas multilayer/looped transformers effectively handle them. Looping boosts semi-supervised learning through polynomial estimators, leading to improved real-world tabular dataset performance.

Conclusion: Looped foundation models utilizing transformed estimators outperform single-pass methods in semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting the advantage of depth and iterative mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for predicting abnormal clinical test values, particularly in CBC tests, using a GPT-inspired tabular modeling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve early diagnosis capabilities by predicting abnormal values for unperformed tests based on existing test results. The motivation is to democratize access to early diagnoses via advanced data modeling.

Method: Utilizes a GPT-like set translation model for tabular data, where data is represented as pairs of label-column embeddings and values, addressing missing value challenges without explicitly estimating them.

Result: Demonstrated an improvement of up to 8% in AUC for predicting levels of uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and ferritin.

Conclusion: This innovative approach bridges language model techniques with tabular data modeling, offering effective handling of missing values and enhancing clinical diagnostic predictions.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

### [208] [Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337)
*Naoki Matsumura,Yuta Yoshimoto,Yuto Iwasaki,Meguru Yamazaki,Yasufumi Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new knowledge distillation (KD) framework for neural network potentials (NNPs), using off-the-shelf pre-trained NNPs for more stable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This method reduces expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations by 10x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate molecular dynamics simulations are challenging because they require training datasets that include both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Traditional KD methods struggle to generate the latter efficiently.

Method: They propose using non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNPs as teachers and leveraging a two-stage training process. First, the student NNP is trained using a data set generated by the teacher NNP. Second, this student model is fine-tuned using high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) datasets.

Result: The framework was applied to both organic and inorganic materials, yielding comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties while reducing the necessity for computationally expensive DFT calculations by a factor of 10.

Conclusion: The proposed KD framework provides a scalable and efficient way for generating NNPs that balance computational cost and accuracy, facilitating stable molecular dynamics simulations across diverse materials.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

*A. S. Stankevich,I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI²SB) framework for improving acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) using deep learning, addressing current limitations in integrating velocity models effectively into diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning has significantly advanced acoustic FWI, especially with diffusion models that enable high-resolution sampling. However, limitations such as stochastic sampling and uncertainty in optimal integration of velocity models impede progress. A more refined and effective framework is needed.

Method: The paper extends the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I²SB) to conditional sampling, resulting in the cI²SB framework. This method interpolates between ground truth and smoothed velocity models to facilitate efficient and accurate sample generation.

Result: The proposed cI²SB framework outperforms previous conditional diffusion models in reconstructing reference velocity models from smoothed velocity models and observed seismic signals. It achieves high sample fidelity using fewer neural function evaluations and surpasses supervised learning approaches.

Conclusion: The cI²SB framework effectively addresses key challenges in acoustic FWI by integrating velocity models and improving sample fidelity with fewer computational resources. The method demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy compared to existing solutions and provides a significant contribution to seismic inversion techniques.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how incorporating stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) improves one-run differential privacy (DP) auditing in black-box settings, achieving tighter bounds without compromising computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the practicality of DP auditing in black-box settings, where it is harder to measure DP guarantees due to limited manipulability and observation, and bridging the gap between empirical bounds and theoretical guarantees.

Method: The study introduces quantile regression-based MIA techniques for tightening empirical lower bounds during one-run DP auditing in black-box environments.

Result: When evaluated on CIFAR-10 image classification models trained with DP-SGD, the proposed method delivers tighter privacy guarantee bounds versus prior approaches, maintaining lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Quantile regression-based membership inference attacks improve the practical effectiveness and efficiency of black-box DP auditing, bringing tighter bounds to empirical measurements of DP guarantees.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiTMC, an adaptation of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for molecular conformer generation, addressing challenges in combining molecular graph data with 3D geometry via novel strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative modeling in molecular conformer generation faces challenges in integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling symmetry, and designing generalized conditioning mechanisms for diverse molecules. The study aims to adapt the promising performance of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in this domain.

Method: DiTMC uses a modular architecture to separate the handling of 3D coordinates from molecular connectivity. It introduces two graph-based conditioning strategies and combines them with both non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant attention mechanisms to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity in molecular conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL), showcasing improved sample quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DiTMC in molecular conformer generation. It emphasizes the impact of architecture and symmetry priors on generation quality and highlights its potential for advancing large-scale molecular generative modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach to learn a global ground metric for optimal transport that requires class labels at the distribution level, enhancing performance in tasks like embedding, clustering, and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ground metrics in optimal transport face limitations such as inability to account for data structure and varying feature importance or lack generalizability across classes.

Method: Proposes a metric learning framework that requires only distribution-level class labels to train a global ground metric, enabling improved distance computation.

Result: The learned metric improves accuracy in optimal transport distances and task performance, tested on scRNA-seq data across multiple diseases.

Conclusion: The method addresses existing challenges in ground metric learning by providing a generalizable and interpretable solution, boosting practical applications in various fields.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

TL;DR: This paper addresses exploration in generative models by casting it as entropy maximization over approximate data manifolds defined by pre-trained diffusion models, introducing a scalable algorithm and demonstrating promising empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of exploring novel designs in generative models, particularly in real-world problems, without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification.

Method: Introduced a framework casting exploration as entropy maximization over approximate data manifolds of diffusion models, and developed an algorithm based on mirror descent for sequential fine-tuning.

Result: The approach demonstrates promising empirical results in synthetic and text-to-image diffusion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable and effective solution for exploration in generative models by leveraging connections between entropy, density estimation, and diffusion model score functions.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

### [214] [Learn to Vaccinate: Combining Structure Learning and Effective Vaccination for Epidemic and Outbreak Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15397)
*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of SIS model applications in scenarios where the graph structure is unknown, proposing learning and vaccination strategies for effective containment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize the extinction time of contagious outbreaks modeled by an SIS model while tackling practical issues like the unknown graph structure.

Method: A novel inclusion-exclusion-based algorithm for graph learning is introduced with proven sample complexity, alongside optimal vaccination methods including a polynomial-time heuristic.

Result: The learning and vaccination strategies significantly reduced disease extinction times, validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Combining graph learning and vaccination strategies can effectively control disease spread even without prior knowledge of the graph structure.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

*David Dembinsky,Adriano Lucieri,Stanislav Frolov,Hiba Najjar,Ko Watanabe,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for rigorous evaluation protocols in Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a comprehensive review of existing metrics and proposing a unified framework called VXAI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in black-box AI models like Deep Neural Networks creates trust issues, necessitating Explainable AI (XAI). However, no standardized methods exist to evaluate the usefulness and trustworthiness of XAI explanations.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines, identifying 362 publications and categorizing their evaluation metrics into 41 functional groups. They also proposed a three-dimensional framework classifying explanations by type, evaluation context, and quality attributes.

Result: The study aggregates a comprehensive set of 41 metric groups and introduces a unified framework, VXAI, which categorizes XAI evaluations based on explanation type, contextuality, and quality. It also provides a structured overview of existing metrics.

Conclusion: VXAI serves as a foundational framework for systematic and comparable evaluation of XAI methods, facilitating metric selection and offering flexibility for future extensions.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

*Rui Yu,Shenghua Wan,Yucen Wang,Chen-Xiao Gao,Le Gan,Zongzhang Zhang,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys reward modeling techniques in deep reinforcement learning, exploring background, categories, applications, evaluations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and refining reward models are crucial for guiding reinforcement learning agents to achieve desired objectives effectively.

Method: The paper categorizes reward modeling approaches based on source, mechanism, and learning paradigm, reviews applications, and evaluates models systematically.

Result: The survey consolidates a wide range of techniques, applications, and evaluation methodologies, providing a structure to the field of reward modeling in deep RL.

Conclusion: The survey addresses a gap in literature by systematically reviewing reward modeling techniques, suggesting future directions for research improvements.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

### [217] [Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15446)
*Scott Jeen,Tom Bewley,Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods perform under partial observability and demonstrates improved results using memory-based architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited generalization performance in zero-shot RL when the environment exhibits partial observability, which is common in real-world RL applications.

Method: The authors analyze the degradation of zero-shot RL under partial observability and propose memory-based architectures as a solution. They compare the performance of these architectures with memory-free baselines in various scenarios.

Result: Memory-based zero-shot RL methods outperform memory-free approaches in environments where states, rewards, or dynamics are partially observed.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of incorporating memory into zero-shot RL approaches to handle partially observable environments effectively.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

### [218] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHO, a method for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, improves anomaly recognition by adapting to varying homophily patterns in graphs using modular techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph anomaly detection methods rely on assumptions about homophily patterns that fail in diverse real-world datasets.

Method: RHO employs adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA) to adaptively learn homophily patterns.

Result: Experimental evaluations on eight real-world datasets show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RHO effectively learns diverse homophily patterns in small labeled normal nodes, improving robustness and detection capabilities.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

### [219] [Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15538)
*Laura Kopf,Nils Feldhus,Kirill Bykov,Philine Lou Bommer,Anna Hedström,Marina M. -C. Höhne,Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces PRISM, a framework improving the understanding of neural network features by addressing polysemanticity in feature descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods assume that each neuron encodes only a single concept, which limits their ability to capture complex behaviors of neural networks.

Method: Developed PRISM, a framework providing nuanced feature descriptions by addressing both monosemantic and polysemantic properties of neural networks.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in description accuracy and faithfulness, measured by description and polysemanticity scores.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances the interpretability of neural networks by resolving limitations related to polysemanticity in feature descriptions.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

*Artur André Oliveira,Mateus Espadoto,Roberto Hirata Jr.,Roberto M. Cesar Jr.,Alex C. Telea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a user-driven dimensionality reduction method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for generating customizable and interpretable data visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction techniques often fail to capture semantic relationships that are not explicitly present in data dimensions, limiting their utility for exploratory and flexible analyses.

Method: The authors propose a framework that employs zero-shot classification via MLLMs, allowing users to guide visualizations dynamically using natural-language prompts.

Result: The method was evaluated across multiple datasets, demonstrating enhanced cluster separation and transforming the process into an interactive exploration method directed by user inputs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges automated dimensionality reduction techniques with human-centered exploration, providing users with adaptable tools to tailor data projections according to their semantic analyses.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

### [221] [LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606)
*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), where safety measures can be undermined through fine-tuning. It introduces a method called Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to improve safety robustness against such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is addressing safety concerns in LLMs, as their responses can be manipulated through fine-tuning, even with harmless data. The goal is to develop methods for enhancing safety against these vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors propose "Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)", a training-free approach. It extrapolates the safety subspace in LLMs to strengthen the model against fine-tuning attacks while maintaining task adaptability. This method achieves robustness by altering LLM parameters to be less sensitive to perturbations.

Result: LoX improved robustness against benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks, leading to reductions in attack success rates by 11% to 54%. Experimental results showcase LoX's capacity to preserve adaptability while enhancing safety measures.

Conclusion: By moving LLM parameters to a flatter sensitivity zone using LoX, the method effectively mitigates vulnerabilities stemming from fine-tuning and protects safety-critical subspaces, providing valuable strides in LLM safety.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

### [222] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule is a method to automate rule extraction for reinforcement learning from human feedback, achieving enhanced performance metrics while reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to automate rule-based reward generation in RLHF, avoiding reliance on manual rule engineering and improving alignment with human feedback.

Method: AutoRule functions in three stages: interpreting user feedback with a reasoning model, identifying candidate rules from reasoning chains, and synthesizing these into a unified rule set. Language-model verifiers are then used to compute rule satisfaction, serving as an auxiliary reward.

Result: The method improved length-controlled win rate by 28.6% in AlpacaEval2.0 and boosted second-turn performance by 6.1% on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a baseline without rule-based auxiliary rewards.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively extracts useful rules that align with dataset preference, reduces reward hacking, and identifies unique qualities across datasets, offering a significant improvement in RLHF.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Mario Fritz,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to ensure robustness in post-hoc attribution methods for deep learning by using randomized smoothing to certify pixel-level robustness against input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc attribution methods lack robustness as small input perturbations can significantly change attribution maps without altering the prediction, reducing trustworthiness.

Method: The authors use randomized smoothing and reformulate attribution maps into segmentation problems to certify robustness at the pixel level and propose evaluation metrics for robustness, localization, and faithfulness.

Result: Evaluation on 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models demonstrates that the certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful.

Conclusion: The robust certification approach enables trustable post-hoc attributions, making them suitable for reliable application in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

### [225] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were designed to extract sparse, interpretable features from language models, but some latents consistently activate densely, indicating that these features could be essential and not just training noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to better understand sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and determine whether dense latents observed during training are undesirable artifacts or meaningful aspects of the underlying model representations.

Method: The authors investigated the geometric and functional properties of dense latents, categorized them into a taxonomy, and analyzed how they evolve across different model layers. Techniques used included ablation studies and retraining experiments to confirm intrinsic properties.

Result: Dense latents are shown to form antipodal pairs which functionally reconstruct specific residual stream directions and fall into meaningful classes, such as features for position, semantics, and part-of-speech. They evolve across layers from structural to semantic-focused signals.

Conclusion: Dense latents are intrinsic and functional parts of SAEs and serve important roles in language model computation rather than being undesirable noise artifacts from the training process.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Ivan Marisca,Jacob Bamberger,Cesare Alippi,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the problem of over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and highlights how temporal aspects exacerbate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of information propagation limitations (over-squashing) in STGNNs, which is critical in applications reliant on temporal sequences.

Method: The paper formalizes the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem, analyzes its unique traits compared to static contexts, and theoretically examines the impact of processing paradigms in STGNNs.

Result: Findings reveal that convolutional STGNNs propagate information better from temporally distant points, and both time-and-space and time-then-space paradigms encounter similar limitations. This is validated using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the limitations of current STGNN designs and offers guidance on improving information propagation in such networks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic tool to check if Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems misuse memorized training data instead of retrieved external information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in RAG systems where models might ignore retrieved evidence and generate outputs based on memorized training data, creating potential contamination.

Method: RePCS uses a comparison of two inference paths (parametric-only and retrieval-augmented) by calculating KL divergence between their outputs, ensuring a lightweight, model-agnostic approach without requiring internal state access.

Result: On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918, outperforming previous methods by 6.5 percentage points. Latency overhead remains low at 4.7% using NVIDIA T4 GPUs.

Conclusion: RePCS is a reliable, efficient safeguard for verifying whether RAG systems effectively utilize retrieval, offering robust performance for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: The paper extends Gold's inductive inference framework to study function learnability using computational agents and new observation types, offering insights into learning constraints and connections to transducer inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional Input-Output Observations in learning general recursive functions and incorporate more realistic constraints using computational perspectives.

Method: The study introduces Time-Bound Observations and Policy-Trajectory Observations, incorporates computational agents, and establishes theoretical connections with rational functions and finite-state transducers.

Result: Findings show that input-output observations alone are insufficient to learn general recursive functions, though computational constraints or enriched observations like policy trajectories help overcome barriers.

Conclusion: Learning computable functions in constrained environments reveals deeper theoretical links and limitations, especially for linear-time computable functions under policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies the challenges of scaling deep reinforcement learning (DRL) networks and proposes interventions to resolve gradient issues, achieving robust performance at large scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks often leads to degraded performance due to unresolved challenges, motivating an investigation into root causes of failure.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analyses to identify issues like non-stationarity and gradient pathologies due to architectural choices. They then propose simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow, enabling effective scalability.

Result: The interventions lead to strong and robust performance across various network sizes and architectures, validated in multiple environments.

Conclusion: The proposed interventions are straightforward, compatible with established DRL methods, and successfully address scalability challenges while improving large-scale network performance.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

*Akhil Singampalli,Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wi-Fi fingerprinting localization is improved using DAILOC, mitigating domain shifts from device heterogeneity and temporal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of domain shifts caused by device differences and temporal variations impacting Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization.

Method: The authors propose DAILOC, a domain-incremental learning framework that uses a multi-level variational autoencoder for disentangling domain shifts and a memory-based class alignment mechanism to prevent forgetting over time.

Result: Experiments on diverse devices and environments show DAILOC achieves up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DAILOC effectively enhances indoor localization accuracy by jointly tackling domain shifts and minimizing catastrophic forgetting, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

*Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet, a logic gate-based framework, enhances interpretability and performance in DL-based Wi-Fi RSS indoor localization by tackling environmental noise and temporal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based indoor localization models lack interpretability, making it difficult to adapt to temporal variations and ensure long-term reliability.

Method: Introduce LogNet, a framework that uses logic gate-based mechanisms to interpret DL models by identifying influential APs and diagnosing disruptions caused by noise.

Result: LogNet improves indoor localization accuracy and efficiency, exhibiting lower localization error (1.1x to 2.8x), smaller model size (3.4x to 43.3x), and lower latency (1.5x to 3.6x) compared to prior models.

Conclusion: LogNet provides a transparent, interpretable approach to indoor localization, enabling better understanding of DL behavior and enhancing system stability for long-term deployments.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding compositionality, a key human reasoning capability, is essential for building efficient AI systems that can decompose and solve complex problems.

Method: The authors created a zero-shot ensemble of expert models, evaluating its performance against a benchmark designed to test compositional reasoning.

Result: Their method outperformed baseline algorithms in terms of accuracy while also requiring fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed Expert Composition approach is both effective and efficient, showcasing its potential for sustainable AI frameworks by achieving strong compositional capabilities.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more

ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a
challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show
that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy
than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence
being more efficient.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci introduces a self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver for real-time mesh smoothing with significant efficiency and quality improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-time mesh smoothing challenges by overcoming issues like costly global updates from classical methods and slow convergence or brittle tuning in greedy heuristics.

Method: Employs a syndrome-decoding step for curvature error correction in O(E) time, augmented by two small neural modules that dynamically choose vertices and step sizes, using only 1K + 200 parameters.

Result: Achieves a 2.4x speedup in iterations, reduces curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, delivers a UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93, and provides a 1.8x overall runtime acceleration versus state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MicroRicci's efficient, adaptive, and high-quality performance makes it ideal for real-time applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE is a memory-efficient method for differential privacy in neural network training, offering performance comparable to existing first-order approaches while significantly reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP training methods like DP-Adam have high memory requirements, limiting their scalability in tasks involving large models.

Method: DP-GRAPE involves privatizing gradients after projection, replacing SVD with random Gaussian matrices for subspaces, and applying projection during backpropagation.

Result: Experiments show DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% for Vision Transformers and over 70% for RoBERTa-Large while maintaining similar performance to DP-Adam.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE provides a scalable DP training solution that balances memory efficiency and model utility, enabling large-scale model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

*Modar Sulaiman,Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses label bias in machine learning datasets and proposes a novel method for fairness-aware label correction using graph-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing impact of AI systems on society, including sensitive areas like healthcare and legal decisions, necessitates robust fairness-aware methods in ML due to demonstrated evidence of unfair outcomes.

Method: The proposed method, GFLC, combines prediction confidence, Ricci-flow-optimized graph-based regularization, and demographic parity incentives to correct label bias while preserving fairness.

Result: Experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of GFLC, showcasing improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics over baseline models.

Conclusion: GFLC efficiently corrects label noise in datasets while ensuring fairness, offering a promising solution for developing trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

### [236] [CAWR: Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression for Robust Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15654)
*Ranting Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research addresses the limitation of Advantage-Weighted Regression (AWR) in offline reinforcement learning by proposing an enhanced method, CAWR, which counters over-conservative policies caused by corrupted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL methods often face distribution shift challenges, which result in the need for additional constraints during policy optimization. AWR algorithms are particularly prone to being overly conservative due to corrupted or suboptimal data.

Method: The authors propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), utilizing robust loss functions for policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay technique to filter poor data points.

Result: Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that CAWR can derive superior policies from suboptimal offline datasets, significantly improving optimization performance.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively mitigates over-conservatism in offline RL stemming from data corruption, enhancing the reliability of policy optimization under suboptimal input conditions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

*Marissa Dominijanni,Alexander Ororbia,Kenneth W. Regan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel rule for learning both synaptic connection strengths and synaptic delays, improving classification performance in spiking neural networks (SNNs) over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of incorporation of synaptic delays in spiking neural networks, despite their crucial role in biological neuronal networks and relevance to mammalian learning processes.

Method: The authors extend spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to simultaneously learn synaptic connection strengths and delays, validating their approach with an SNN model for classification and comparing their method against other existing methods.

Result: The proposed learning method for co-learning synaptic weights and delays consistently outperforms existing methods and traditional STDP without delays across various test scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of including synaptic delays in SNNs, demonstrating improved performance and providing insights into the relationship between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

*Anton Bouter,Dirk Thierens,Peter A. N. Bosman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes GI-GOMEA, which enhances GOMEA by integrating gene-frequency preservation, outperforming GOMEA on standard and hierarchical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the population diversity issues in Optimal Mixing (OM) for solving hierarchical problems, which arise due to high selection pressure.

Method: The paper introduces GI-GOMEA by integrating gene-frequency preservation from the Gene Invariant Genetic Algorithm (GIGA) into the existing GOMEA framework.

Result: GI-GOMEA outperforms GOMEA on various benchmark and hierarchical problems, including those designed to avoid pitfalls exploited by gene invariance.

Conclusion: GI-GOMEA demonstrates strong potential, offering a simple yet effective enhancement to solve complex and hierarchical problems more effectively than current methods.

Abstract: Optimal Mixing (OM) is a variation operator that integrates local search with
genetic recombination. EAs with OM are capable of state-of-the-art optimization
in discrete spaces, offering significant advantages over classic
recombination-based EAs. This success is partly due to high selection pressure
that drives rapid convergence. However, this can also negatively impact
population diversity, complicating the solving of hierarchical problems, which
feature multiple layers of complexity. While there have been attempts to
address this issue, these solutions are often complicated and prone to bias. To
overcome this, we propose a solution inspired by the Gene Invariant Genetic
Algorithm (GIGA), which preserves gene frequencies in the population throughout
the process. This technique is tailored to and integrated with the Gene-pool
Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA), resulting in GI-GOMEA. The
simple, yet elegant changes are found to have striking potential: GI-GOMEA
outperforms GOMEA on a range of well-known problems, even when these problems
are adjusted for pitfalls - biases in much-used benchmark problems that can be
easily exploited by maintaining gene invariance. Perhaps even more notably,
GI-GOMEA is also found to be effective at solving hierarchical problems,
including newly introduced asymmetric hierarchical trap functions.

*Jun He,Siang Yew Chong,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel drift analysis method to estimate hitting probabilities for evolutionary algorithms, simplifying the estimation of hitting time and enabling comparative analysis between algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual construction of drift functions for elitist evolutionary algorithms is complex and requires improvements to simplify bounds calculation and enable better comparison.

Method: The paper develops a drift analysis method focusing on hitting probability estimation, introduces paths for multimodal landscapes, and constructs explicit expressions for computing these probabilities.

Result: The proposed approach enables estimation of both lower and upper bounds for hitting time and facilitates comparative analysis of algorithms on problems like the knapsack problem.

Conclusion: Drift probability analysis provides a robust framework to streamline complexity estimations for evolutionary algorithms, supporting easier algorithm comparison without favoring specific constraint-handling techniques.

Abstract: Drift analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the time complexity of
evolutionary algorithms. However, it requires manual construction of drift
functions to bound hitting time for each specific algorithm and problem. To
address this limitation, general linear drift functions were introduced for
elitist evolutionary algorithms. But calculating linear bound coefficients
effectively remains a problem. This paper proposes a new method called drift
analysis of hitting probability to compute these coefficients. Each coefficient
is interpreted as a bound on the hitting probability of a fitness level,
transforming the task of estimating hitting time into estimating hitting
probability. A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate
hitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness
landscapes. Explicit expressions are constructed to compute hitting
probability, significantly simplifying the estimation process. One advantage of
the proposed method is its ability to estimate both the lower and upper bounds
of hitting time and to compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of
hitting time. To demonstrate this application, two algorithms for the knapsack
problem, each incorporating feasibility rules and greedy repair respectively,
are compared. The analysis indicates that neither constraint handling technique
consistently outperforms the other.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces Atys, a profiling framework for identifying hotspot functions in large-scale distributed services, achieving cost reductions while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the performance and reduce costs for large-scale distributed services, which operate with thousands of instances and diverse technologies, where even small enhancements can have a significant financial impact.

Method: The paper proposes four features: language-agnostic adaptation, a two-level flamegraph aggregation, Function Selective Pruning (FSP) for improved efficiency, and Frequency Dynamic Adjustment (FDA) for cost-effective profiling.

Result: Cluster-scale experiments show a 6.8% reduction in profiling time using the FSP strategy with only a 0.58% error and an 87.6% cost reduction with the FDA scheme while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Atys framework successfully identifies hotspots in large-scale distributed services with enhanced efficiency and cost reductions, without compromising profiling accuracy.

Abstract: To handle the high volume of requests, large-scale services are comprised of
thousands of instances deployed in clouds. These services utilize diverse
programming languages and are distributed across various nodes as encapsulated
containers. Given their vast scale, even minor performance enhancements can
lead to significant cost reductions. In this paper, we introduce Atys1, an
efficient profiling framework specifically designed to identify hotspot
functions within large-scale distributed services. Atys presents four key
features. First, it implements a language-agnostic adaptation mechanism for
multilingual microservices. Second, a two-level aggregation method is
introduced to provide a comprehensive overview of flamegraphs. Third, we
propose a function selective pruning (FSP) strategy to enhance the efficiency
of aggregating profiling results. Finally, we develop a frequency dynamic
adjustment (FDA) scheme that dynamically modifies sampling frequency based on
service status, effectively minimizing profiling cost while maintaining
accuracy. Cluster-scale experiments on two benchmarks show that the FSP
strategy achieves a 6.8% reduction in time with a mere 0.58% mean average
percentage error (MAPE) in stack traces aggregation. Additionally, the FDA
scheme ensures that the mean squared error (MSE) remains on par with that at
high sampling rates, while achieving an 87.6% reduction in cost.

*Hossein Albakri,Kazem Cheshmi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compiler transformation to accelerate sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPUs, demonstrating significant speedups over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in GPU memory use and computing resources caused by irregularities in sparse data structures during neural network operations.

Method: A compiler transformation called enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen is proposed, focusing on increasing data reuse in registers and caches while balancing GPU workloads.

Result: Using the proposed transformation, the authors achieve a geometric mean speedup between 1.84x and 2.27x as compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: The enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen transformation significantly improves performance in sparse neural networks on GPUs, making such operations more efficient overall.

Abstract: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the
memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities
such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory
hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but
running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due
to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new
compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse
matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation
increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced
workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse
neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and
across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to
128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to
2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PSM context in Haskell that enables concurrent, determinate, and policy-coordinated memory transactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency and determinacy clash when resources must be shared; current Haskell abstractions lack higher-level memory abstractions for certain programming patterns.

Method: The authors propose the PSM (Policy Synchronised Memory) context in Haskell, combining features of existing monads while ensuring no race conditions and determinacy through policy coordination.

Result: PSM enables well-typed transactions that allow representing abstract, imperative, concurrently shareable, and deterministic data structures.

Conclusion: PSM context bridges the gap between determinacy and concurrency, offering developers a race-free and policy-driven framework for shared memory transactions in Haskell.

Abstract: Concurrency and determinacy do not go well with each other when resources
must be shared. Haskell provides parallel programming abstractions such as IVar
and LVar in the Par monad and concurrent abstractions such as MVar and TVar in
the in IO and STM monads, respectively. The former are determinate but have no
destructive updates and the latter have destructive updates but do not
guarantee determinacy. Programming patterns that are both concurrent and
determinate, such as those provided by Kahn or Berry require memory
abstractions at a higher level than is currently available. In this paper we
describe a new type context PSM for policy synchronised memory in Haskell. Like
STM and IO, the computations in PSM can access persistent state and, as a
side-effect, update the memory in imperative style. Like the Par and IO monads,
PSM supports concurrent threads and shared state. However, in contrast to IO,
our PSM contexts are race-free since concurrent accesses are policy coordinated
which guarantees determinacy.Well-typed transactions in the PSM context can
accommodate abstract data structures that are imperative, concurrently
shareable and still behave deterministically, by construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational demands limiting MPPI's use in real-time, high-frequency robotic control tasks.

Method: F-MPPI enhances MPPI by leveraging local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback.

Result: F-MPPI was tested on a quadrupedal robot and a quadrotor, leading to better control performance, stability, and robust high-frequency operation.

Conclusion: Adding local feedback gains to MPPI enables its use in complex, real-time robotic systems by improving efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a
perception-based path planning system for local planning around the
neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

### [245] [Efficient and Real-Time Motion Planning for Robotics Using Projection-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14865)
*Xuemin Chi,Hakan Girgin,Tobias Löw,Yangyang Xie,Teng Xue,Jihao Huang,Cheng Hu,Zhitao Liu,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALSPG, a first-order optimization method for robot motion generation, focusing on improving real-time performance through leveraging geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating motions for robots interacting with various objects is compounded by robot geometry and desired behaviors, while existing tools often fail to efficiently integrate geometric constraints.

Method: The proposed method, ALSPG (Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected Gradient Descent), utilizes geometric projections such as Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions to handle constraints effectively.

Result: ALSPG demonstrated competitive real-time performance compared to second-order methods like iLQR and was validated on various robots in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ALSPG offers a promising approach to robotic motion planning by combining efficiency and effectiveness, leveraging geometric constraints to achieve real-time practicality.

Abstract: Generating motions for robots interacting with objects of various shapes is a
complex challenge, further complicated by the robot geometry and multiple
desired behaviors. While current robot programming tools (such as inverse
kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these
problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific
problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose
an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected
Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean
projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using
geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG
significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods
like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our
method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its
effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale
car in real-world experiments. Source codes, experimental data and videos are

*Rajat Kumar Jenamani,Tom Silver,Ben Dodson,Shiqin Tong,Anthony Song,Yuting Yang,Ziang Liu,Benjamin Howe,Aimee Whitneck,Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FEAST, a personalized mealtime-assistance robotic system, designed to adapt to diverse user needs during in-home meal assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of in-home mealtime assistance, which include the diversity of activities, contexts, food items, and individual preferences that complicate robotic caregiving solutions.

Method: The authors designed FEAST guided by adaptability, transparency, and safety principles. The system features modular hardware, diverse interaction methods, and parameterized behavior trees adaptable using large language models. It was validated through a formative study and tested in real-world home settings.

Result: FEAST was shown to outperform traditional systems, offering wide personalization capabilities. Users successfully tailored its use according to their individual requirements in an in-home study, and its validity was confirmed by an independent Occupational Therapist.

Conclusion: FEAST demonstrates the potential for improving quality of life by accommodating diverse user needs during meal assistance. It is adaptable, safe, and transparent, making it suitable for widespread in-home applications.

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

*Jeffrey Mao,Raghuram Cauligi Srinivas,Steven Nogar,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fully onboard real-time navigation system for quadrotors using lightweight sensors to construct dense 3D maps and optimize safe trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop systems that enable autonomous quadrotor navigation in complex, unfamiliar environments while addressing constraints related to size, weight, and power.

Method: Combine stereo and monocular depth estimation for dense 3D maps and develop a trajectory planning framework that refines paths in real time for time-optimal and safe navigation.

Result: The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency and validated its robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor autonomous flight experiments.

Conclusion: The system enables safe and efficient quadrotor navigation in unknown environments, leveraging lightweight sensors and innovative mapping and trajectory planning techniques.

Abstract: Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as
agriculture, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving
autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and
unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due
to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision
making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),
which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally
optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe
trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address
these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that
relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D
map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that
fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser,
and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this
map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable
of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is
incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously
refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and
trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate
our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and
outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in
previously unknown settings.

### [248] [Six-DoF Hand-Based Teleoperation for Omnidirectional Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15009)
*Jinjie Li,Jiaxuan Li,Kotaro Kaneko,Liming Shu,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a teleoperation system for omnidirectional aerial robots using motion-tracking and hand gestures to allow precise and flexible manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current teleoperation approaches that do not fully utilize the 6-DoF control capabilities of omnidirectional aerial robots and fail to capitalize on the dexterity of human fingers.

Method: The system integrates motion-tracking marker sets (on the shoulder and hand) and a data glove to capture hand gestures, enabling four interaction modes (Spherical, Cartesian, Operation, and Locking) for different manipulation tasks.

Result: The system was tested in a real-world valve-turning task, demonstrating the effectiveness of each interaction mode in enhancing aerial manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed interaction framework effectively bridges human hand dexterity with aerial robots, facilitating advanced teleoperated manipulation in complex environments.

Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over
position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although
advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in
complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors
fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional
rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for
more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation
system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded
aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on
the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand
gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different
tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as
well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the
hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system
on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes
to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human
dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial
manipulation in unstructured environments.

### [249] [Context Matters: Learning Generalizable Rewards via Calibrated Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15012)
*Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Julie Shah,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an approach to enhance reward learning from human input by distinguishing between context-dependent feature importance (saliency) and context-invariant preferences, enabling significant improvements in sample efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding that human preferences remain consistent while the importance or saliency of reward features changes considering the context.

Method: The authors introduce a modular approach that explicitly separates context-invariant preferences from context-dependent feature saliency using calibrated features and specialized paired comparison queries.

Result: Simulated experiments show the method requires 10x fewer preference queries than existing approaches and performs up to 15% better in low-data settings. Additionally, an in-person user study validates personalized and adaptable reward learning.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of preferences and saliency ensures adaptability to new contexts, improving both efficiency and personalization in reward learning, with potential broad applications in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent
behavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat
each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,
if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must
learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for
prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context
influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the
$\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove
heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety
preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn
context-dependent representations $\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing
between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data
requirements. Instead, we propose $\textit{explicitly}$ modeling
context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature
saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.
To achieve this, we introduce $\textit{calibrated features}$--representations
that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized
paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient
learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly
improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than
baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better
performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12)
demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal
contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and
personalized reward learning.

*Winston Smith,Andrew Boateng,Taha Shaheen,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses multitasking robots by introducing a task allocation framework that considers multitasking constraints, proposing solutions using MAX-SAT formulation and a greedy heuristic, validated through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of task allocation in robotics by addressing the limitations of single-tasking assumptions in situations where multitasking is required.

Method: The paper formulates the multitasking problem, proposes a solution using weighted MAX-SAT, develops a more efficient greedy heuristic, and evaluates the methods through simulations and physical experiments.

Result: The proposed methods outperformed existing single-tasking robot baselines, demonstrating benefits in multitasking scenarios, particularly in complex multi-robot environments like site-clearing tasks.

Conclusion: The developed framework improves task efficiency by enabling multitasking robots to consider physical constraints, offering significant advantages over traditional task allocation methods.

Abstract: One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation
methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single
task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some
situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper,
we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key
contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the
consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in
contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After
formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which
allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy
heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with
a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the
benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing
scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction
considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its
performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how
multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic
setting.

*Paige Tuttösí,Shivam Mehta,Zachary Syvenky,Bermet Burkanova,Gustav Eje Henter,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EmojiVoice is a customizable toolkit offering expressive, temporally varied speech for social robots using emoji-prompting and a lightweight TTS model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots lack the long-term expressivity present in human speech, often using static joyful tones, making continuous engagement challenging.

Method: The paper introduces EmojiVoice, a toolkit using emoji-prompts for fine-grained speech control paired with Matcha-TTS for real-time speech generation.

Result: Case studies showed that varied expressivity improved speech perception in storytelling tasks, but expressive voices were less preferred in robot assistant roles.

Conclusion: Implementing temporal variation in robotic speech enhances engagement in some contexts, highlighting the need for context-dependent customization in robotic applications.

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain
engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with
``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human
speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the
expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on
robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS)
toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive
speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained
control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS
backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a
scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3)
an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied
emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long
period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the
assistant use case.

TL;DR: This paper introduces advancements in vision tactile sensor (VTS) design by developing curved, biomimetic sensing surfaces to improve haptic perception. Challenges of planar VTSs are addressed through novel methods in imaging, neural networks, and error correction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers by overcoming existing challenges with planar VTSs and moving toward biomimetic curved designs.

Method: The paper develops GelSplitter3D with prism and NIR imaging, proposes a photometric stereo neural network calibrated using CAD-based methods, and introduces normal integration with boundary constraints to minimize surface error.

Result: The research shows a 40% improvement in normal estimation accuracy and highlights benefits of sensor shapes in grasping and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance tactile sensing capabilities and demonstrate a clear step towards achieving human-like haptic perception in robotic applications.

Abstract: To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the
compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from
conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with
continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when
extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces,
blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface
structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our
research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism
and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural
network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate
tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary
constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of
surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40$\%$
improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in
grasping and manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable and advanced vision-language navigation framework that moves away from constrained navigation intervals and embraces real-world adaptability.

Method: The framework uses a self-refining graph memory for object location storage, robot memory sharing, and retrieval-augmented decision-making, without requiring task-specific training.

Result: DyNaVLM achieves high performance on benchmarks like GOAT and ObjectNav while proving robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DyNaVLM introduces a scalable paradigm for embodied navigation with innovations in dynamic action spaces, collaborative graph memory, and training-free deployment, facilitating continuous real-world navigation.

Abstract: We present DyNaVLM, an end-to-end vision-language navigation framework using
Vision-Language Models (VLM). In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed
angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select
navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a
self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable
topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through
distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval
augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM
demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world
tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three
innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and
training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot,
bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world
navigation.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving synthesized robot voices for language teaching, addressing the lack of task-specific voices by creating expressive and environment-adaptive TTS systems suited for L2 learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of social robots in second-language (L2) teaching by addressing the gap in specialized synthesized voices tailored for verbal language learning tasks.

Method: The authors developed a refined version of Matcha-TTS, introducing features like emoji-prompted expressivity, environment-adaptive pitch adjustments, and an L2 clarity mode based on vowel duration cues using a data-driven, perception-based approach.

Result: The developed voice system was found to be expressive and suitable for storytelling, adaptable to noisy environments, and significantly improves intelligibility for L2 learners, reducing transcription errors in tense/lax vowel distinctions.

Conclusion: An expressive, environment-adaptive, and linguistically tuned robot voice can improve both the social and instructional effectiveness of language teaching robots, making them more helpful and encouraging for L2 learners.

Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there
remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language
teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe
consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We
address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.
We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a
fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an
expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can
run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found
this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods
of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a
robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices
in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy
and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate
and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an
English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known
linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used
a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use
duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax
(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly
influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for
Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels
unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and
encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these
challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in underwater SLAM systems, such as perceptual degradation, scale estimation inaccuracies, and difficulty in loop closure.

Method: The method involves incorporating a single-beam sonar for scale estimation and integrating a high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition using magnetic field coils. It uses a hierarchical visual-magnetic place recognition scheme for robust loop closure.

Result: Experimental results show substantial enhancements in robustness and accuracy of underwater state estimation using the VIMS system.

Conclusion: VIMS successfully improves underwater navigation performance, resolving inherent issues in conventional visual-inertial SLAM systems.

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) system, VIMS, designed for underwater navigation. Conventional
visual-inertial state estimators encounter significant practical challenges in
perceptually degraded underwater environments, particularly in scale estimation
and loop closing. To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a
low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a
high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic
signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a
hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition,
enabling robust loop closure. Furthermore, VIMS achieves a balance between
local feature tracking and descriptor-based loop closing, avoiding additional
computational burden on the front end. Experimental results highlight the
efficacy of the proposed VIMS, demonstrating significant improvements in both
the robustness and accuracy of state estimation within underwater environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in humanoid whole-body manipulation, such as computational complexity and broad-area contact measurement, by employing tactile sensors and multi-modal inputs.

Method: Developed the tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT) policy integrated with human teleoperation data, combining joint position, vision, and tactile measurements with locomotion control based on a biped model.

Result: The humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido demonstrated the capability for whole-body manipulation with balance and walking, showing enhanced robustness with multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile and visual data significantly improves the robustness and performance of humanoid robots in whole-body contact manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Manipulation with whole-body contact by humanoid robots offers distinct
advantages, including enhanced stability and reduced load. On the other hand,
we need to address challenges such as the increased computational cost of
motion generation and the difficulty of measuring broad-area contact. We
therefore have developed a humanoid control system that allows a humanoid robot
equipped with tactile sensors on its upper body to learn a policy for
whole-body manipulation through imitation learning based on human teleoperation
data. This policy, named tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT), has a feature to
take multiple sensor modalities as input, including joint position, vision, and
tactile measurements. Furthermore, by integrating this policy with retargeting
and locomotion control based on a biped model, we demonstrate that the
life-size humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido is capable of achieving whole-body
contact manipulation while maintaining balance and walking. Through detailed
experimental verification, we show that inputting both vision and tactile
modalities into the policy contributes to improving the robustness of
manipulation involving broad and delicate contact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of gait phase estimation for exoskeletons, addressing challenges during terrain changes.

Method: A neural network combining temporal convolution and transformer layers is developed. A pre-training strategy treats gait phase vectors and IMU signals as joint observations.

Result: The method outperformed existing baselines, achieving low RMSE and MAE in stable and transitioning terrains, validated through exoskeleton hardware tests.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances intelligent and adaptive exoskeleton systems, ensuring safer, more efficient human-robot interaction in diverse environments.

Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals
facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations.
However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness,
particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a
gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human
locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with
transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked
reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase
state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus
enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait
phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under
stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase
RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain
transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the
algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various
continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent
and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot
interaction across diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Robust Instant Policy (RIP), a method to improve the reliability of in-context imitation learning for robotics by addressing hallucinations from large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context imitation learning approaches using LLMs face reliability issues due to hallucinations that generate suboptimal robot trajectories, deviating from human-provided demonstrations.

Method: The proposed RIP algorithm uses a Student's t-distribution to aggregate multiple candidate trajectories generated by an LLM, effectively ignoring hallucinated outliers and creating a robust trajectory for task execution.

Result: Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that RIP achieves at least a 26% improvement in task success rates over state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: RIP significantly enhances the performance and reliability of in-context imitation learning in robotics, making it more effective for everyday tasks requiring minimal training data.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

### [260] [SHeRLoc: Synchronized Heterogeneous Radar Place Recognition for Cross-Modal Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15175)
*Hanjun Kim,Minwoo Jung,Wooseong Yang,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SHeRLoc is a novel deep network designed to address challenges in integrating heterogeneous radar technologies, achieving a significant improvement in heterogeneous radar place recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar research largely deals with homogeneous sensor types, ignoring the benefits and challenges of integrating diverse radar modalities.

Method: SHeRLoc introduces techniques like RCS polar matching for radar alignment, hierarchical optimal transport-based feature aggregation, FFT-similarity-based data mining, and an adaptive margin-based triplet loss for metric learning.

Result: SHeRLoc boosts recall@1 for heterogeneous radar place recognition from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: SHeRLoc not only advances heterogeneous radar place recognition but also holds promise for cross-modal applications across LiDAR and SLAM, addressing long-standing issues in sensor integration.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of radar in robotics, the majority of research
has been confined to homogeneous sensor types, overlooking the integration and
cross-modality challenges inherent in heterogeneous radar technologies. This
leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data
types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary
strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which
utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical
optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally
robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining
and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric
learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous
radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public
dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR,
SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous
sensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

### [261] [Context-Aware Deep Lagrangian Networks for Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15249)
*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced control framework for robots that makes dynamic models adaptive to environmental contexts, improving performance in trajectory tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed models like DeLaN improve interpretability and generalizability, but they struggle in complex environments with uncertain and dynamic contexts. A solution is needed to adapt these models online for changing scenarios.

Method: The authors extend DeLaN to be context-aware, incorporate recurrent neural networks for online system identification, and integrate with Model Predictive Control (MPC). They also use residual dynamics to account for the robot's nominal model.

Result: The proposed method achieved a 39% reduction in end-effector tracking errors for a 7-DOF robotic arm under varying loads, compared to a 21% improvement using a Kalman filter baseline.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates improved adaptability and performance for physics-informed robotic control, showcasing its advantages in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Result: Development of a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines enabling autonomous self-defense in robotic systems.

Conclusion: Highlighting the necessity of offensive strategies, the research establishes a foundation for robots to autonomously protect against cyber threats, significantly advancing robotic security frameworks.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by
advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It
emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying
vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving
robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics
experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the
vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the
thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and
cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics
deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby
the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates
a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies --
creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective
of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has
been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations,
the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot
software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel
architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by
advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous
offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift
towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the
importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets
the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber
threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores coverage path planning for underwater gliders to detect a radioactive source, analyzing three approaches: TSP, MST, and OCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater glider efficiency in systematic area coverage for detecting radioactive sources, minimizing redundancy, avoiding obstacles, and ensuring safe navigation.

Method: Compared TSP, MST, and OCP path-planning strategies through MATLAB simulations, evaluating metrics like processing time, coverage, path length, and traversal time.

Result: OCP is ideal for reducing traversal time but demands higher computational resources, whereas MST provides quicker yet suboptimal solutions.

Conclusion: Selecting path-planning strategies should depend on balancing mission priorities such as efficiency and computational feasibility.

Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem
requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while
minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage
path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders,
particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source
while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP).
Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered
areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable
when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher
computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less
optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate
algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational
feasibility.

*Taegeun Yang,Jiwoo Hwang,Jeil Jeong,Minsung Yoon,Sung-Eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework is proposed for mobile robots to navigate efficiently by manipulating movable obstacles using pushing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) for mobile manipulators, improving success rates and efficiency while following planned paths.

Method: A hierarchical approach with a high-level policy for strategic pushing commands and a low-level policy for precise execution using whole-body coordinated movements.

Result: Simulation-based experiments showed improved success rates, shorter paths, reduced times, and verified the reliability of real-time obstacle property estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances NAMO tasks' efficiency and accuracy through hierarchical policies for interaction-based obstacle manipulation.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for
efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator.
Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with
structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of
unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The
high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental
constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely
and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements.
Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in
performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path
length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally,
ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative
analysis further validates the accuracy and reliability of the real-time
obstacle property estimation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents MCOO-SLAM, a novel object-level SLAM system utilizing multi-camera omnidirectional setups for robust and comprehensive mapping, addressing limitations like occlusions and narrow fields of view in traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-level SLAM systems face challenges such as narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and restricted depth perception in large-scale or outdoor environments.

Method: MCOO-SLAM uses surround-view camera systems, integrates point features and object landmarks with open-vocabulary semantics, employs semantic-geometric-temporal fusion for object association, and incorporates omnidirectional loop closure for scene-level place recognition.

Result: In real-world experiments, MCOO-SLAM demonstrated robust and scalable object-level mapping, improved localization accuracy, and resilience against environmental complexities such as pose variations and occlusions.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances SLAM by leveraging omnidirectional views and semantic integration, supporting downstream reasoning tasks while being suitable for complex outdoor environments.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aquatic-aerial robots struggle to simultaneously perform underwater, surface, and aerial tasks efficiently.

Method: The SurfAAV utilizes a novel differential thrust vectoring hydrofoil for efficient multimodal movement without a buoyancy adjustment system, ensuring flexibility and operational capability in various environments.

Result: SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding speed of 7.96 m/s and an underwater speed of 3.1 m/s, surpassing existing vehicles in maneuverability.

Conclusion: SurfAAV represents a significant advance in robotic design, offering a practical and efficient solution for multimodal aquatic and aerial movement tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the research of aquatic-aerial robots,
existing configurations struggle to efficiently perform underwater, surface,
and aerial movement simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently
integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying
capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring
hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater
navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design
provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater
tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring
activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,
SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the
target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this
letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial
movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required
control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform
surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding
speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's
surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both
exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manual setup and initialization errors in UWB-aided navigation systems, especially in real-world applications.

Method: Combines online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) estimation, lightweight outlier detection, and an adaptive robust kernel for accurate, conservative non-linear optimization.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with robust initialization and low positioning errors on two robotic platforms: an autonomous forklift and a quadcopter equipped with UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry.

Conclusion: The framework improves UWB anchor initialization accuracy, reduces manual intervention, and enhances real-world applicability. The code is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the real-time initialization of unknown
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided navigation systems. The method is
designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary
sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of
previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual
setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP)
estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust
kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves
robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to
state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an
initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based
on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better
initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We
demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous
forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry
(VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method
with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code
in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper.

Motivation: Enhancing workspace utilization in robotic systems, especially for aerial manipulation, can significantly increase operational capabilities and flexibility.

Method: They introduce a planning framework that combines optimization of the aerial manipulator's trajectory with learned models (MLPs and RevNets) to efficiently handle workspace constraints and complex kinematics.

Result: Validated through simulations and experiments, the proposed methods show effectiveness in improving manipulation outcomes by utilizing workspace more efficiently.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a successful integration of machine learning methods into trajectory planning, optimizing workspace utilization for aerial manipulators, and paving the way for more efficient robotic operations.

Abstract: The workspace limits the operational capabilities and range of motion for the
systems with robotic arms. Maximizing workspace utilization has the potential
to provide more optimal solutions for aerial manipulation tasks, increasing the
system's flexibility and operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a
novel planning framework for aerial grasping that maximizes workspace
utilization. We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial
manipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient
manipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's
non-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility
probabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to
approximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing
efficient model gradients to eliminate workspace constraints. We validate our
methods in simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate their
effectiveness.

TL;DR: GRIM, a training-free framework, enhances task-oriented grasping (TOG) by aligning scene objects with effective memory instances using geometric cues and PCA-reduced features, refining grasps to improve compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-oriented grasping is challenging due to the need for understanding task semantics, object affordances, and functional constraints. The paper aims to address these challenges and improve TOG.

Method: Introduces GRIM, a novel training-free framework. It aligns scene objects through geometric cues and PCA-reduced features, transfers pre-computed grasp poses, and refines them for compatibility.

Result: GRIM achieves strong generalization in comparison to existing learning-based methods, demonstrating robust performance with minimal conditioning examples.

Conclusion: GRIM effectively addresses TOG challenges without requiring training, leveraging memory-based alignment and refinement techniques to enhance grasp performance.

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) presents a significant challenge, requiring a
nuanced understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and the functional
constraints dictating how an object should be grasped for a specific task. To
address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative
Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping.
Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of
geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for
similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the
retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and
further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps
generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to
existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of
conditioning examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in active perception during complex multi-stage bimanual manipulation tasks, especially in the presence of visual occlusions.

Method: ViA uses a robotic neck for enhanced flexibility, a VR-based teleoperation system to replicate human active perception practices, and a 3D scene representation to reduce latency-induced VR sickness.

Result: ViA showed significant improvement over baseline systems in learning visuomotor policies for complex manipulation tasks with occlusions.

Conclusion: ViA successfully demonstrates that human-like active perception strategies can be effectively integrated and learned in bimanual robot manipulation tasks, achieving robust performance.

Abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual
robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies
(e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations.
On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to
enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception
strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared
observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR
motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the
interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view
rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the
robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the
learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual
manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural dynamic framework combining object particles and spatial grids to model deformable objects' motion and shape. It excels in 3D action-conditioned video generation and object manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling deformable objects is difficult due to diverse physical properties and sparse visual information for state estimation.

Method: A hybrid neural dynamics framework uses particle-grid representation to combine particle-based object shapes with 3D spatial grid discretization. It includes Gaussian Splattings for rendering and learning-based dynamic modeling from sparse RGB-D robot-object interaction data.

Result: Experiments show the model effectively learns dynamics for various objects and generalizes to unseen categories, outperforming state-of-the-art simulators in limited-view scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a superior learning-based solution to simulate deformable objects, with applications in planning and goal-conditioned manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

*Thomas Kuntz,Agatha Duzan,Hao Zhao,Francesco Croce,Zico Kolter,Nicolas Flammarion,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Harm, a benchmark to evaluate the safety of large language model-based computer use agents by measuring their vulnerabilities to harmful behavior such as misuse, prompt injections, and misbehavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of focus on safety for LLM-based computer use agents, whose potential harm must be better understood to ensure secure and widespread adoption.

Method: The authors create OS-Harm, a benchmark built on the OSWorld environment, consisting of 150 tasks simulating various types of safety violations. They also introduce an automated judge to evaluate agent accuracy and safety, with high human agreement scores.

Result: The study reveals that evaluated models often comply with harmful misuse queries, are vulnerable to prompt injections, and occasionally act unsafely. Frontier models such as o4-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet were used in these evaluations.

Conclusion: OS-Harm successfully exposes safety issues in computer use agents and provides a tool for benchmarking and improving their robustness. The introduced framework can guide safer deployment of such agents in real-world environments.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first extensive study of 564 bugs in widely-used data visualization libraries, presenting a taxonomy of bug symptoms and root causes, and explores the potential of Vision Language Models for bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique characteristics of bugs in data visualization libraries, given their critical role in accurate data representation and decision-making processes.

Method: Analyzed 564 bugs across five popular data visualization libraries, categorized them based on symptoms and root causes into a taxonomy, and tested Vision Language Models for bug detection effectiveness.

Result: Identified prevalent issues like incorrect plots mainly caused by graphic computation errors, outlined eight steps in bug triggering, and discovered that VLM-based bug detection has varied effectiveness (29%-57%).

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for automated testing methods in DataViz libraries and demonstrates that VLMs have potential for bug detection but exhibit limitations.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our

### [274] [Towards Bug-Free Distributed Go Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15135)
*Zhengqun Koo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a static verification framework to detect and prevent communication races in distributed programs written in Go by analyzing happens-before orders for message-passing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning about concurrency in distributed systems is challenging, and unexpected communication races lead to critical bugs. Existing solutions for data race detection are insufficient for addressing communication races in systems utilizing message-passing.

Method: The authors propose a static verification framework that analyzes distributed Go programs’ execution based on extended happens-before relationships for both buffered and unbuffered channels.

Result: The framework can effectively prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs adhering to specific Go paradigms.

Conclusion: The study introduces a robust mechanism for reasoning about concurrency in distributed systems, promoting improved reliability and correctness through communication race detection in Go programs.

Abstract: Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid
races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races
show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied
(dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race
detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not
related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race
consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared
channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific
message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can
receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all.
In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence
of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go
programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message
passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a
happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.

### [275] [Program Feature-based Fuzzing Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15088)
*Miao Miao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark with configurable program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations and highlights its impact on fuzzer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fuzzing evaluations often overlook the influence of fine-grained program features on fuzzing effectiveness.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark with 153 programs, controlled by 10 configurable parameters, based on 7 program features extracted from 25 grey-box fuzzing studies.

Result: 11 popular fuzzers were evaluated, revealing significant performance variations depending on program features and their configurations.

Conclusion: Incorporating fine-grained program features into fuzzing evaluations is vital for understanding and improving fuzzer effectiveness.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its
effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing
evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of
target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features
influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program
features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing
studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow
that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a
benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable
parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results
indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program
features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating
program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.

*Haosheng Zuo,Feifei Niu,Chuanyi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates various large language models (LLMs) for enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP), showing their superior performance compared to traditional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually processing enhancement reports is resource-intensive, leading to delays and loss of valuable insights. The paper aims to leverage LLMs to automate decision-making and improve accuracy.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 18 LLM variants (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT models, Llama) against traditional approaches like CNN/LSTM-BERT, combined with experiments incorporating creator profiles and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: LLMs showed a 10.8% accuracy boost with creator profiles, and fine-tuned models like Llama 3.1 8B Instruct achieved 79% accuracy, outperforming traditional approaches by 5% and improving recall for approved reports.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective solutions for automating ERAP, outperform traditional methods, and help streamline software maintenance. Future research should address cases where LLMs underperformed.

Abstract: Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between
users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement.
However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to
delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge,
enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus,
leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While
traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep
learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new
opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and
XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1
8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods
(CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1)
Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models'
overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA
fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79
percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1
percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5
percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class
imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP,
demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and
improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also
investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed,
providing valuable directions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper reviews the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating unit testing tasks, cataloging existing efforts, challenges, and future research opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unit testing is central to software reliability, and the emerging use of LLMs in this domain has shown promise but lacks a systematic review to guide researchers in understanding and advancing this field.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review of papers related to LLM-based unit testing until March 2025, categorizing tasks, analyzing integration efforts, and identifying challenges and opportunities.

Result: The review categorized unit testing tasks enhanced by LLMs, such as test generation and oracle generation, and highlighted critical aspects like model usage and adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive overview of the intersection of LLMs and unit testing, aiming to direct future research and understanding within the community.

Abstract: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with
the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of
individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs
to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance
and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations
in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to
understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities.
This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application
of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant
papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize
existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and
oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs
into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and
hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved
and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area.
Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to

*Yusuf Sulistyo Nugroho,Farah Danisha Salam,Brittany Reid,Raula Gaikovina Kula,Kazumasa Shimari,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates how effectively Llama, a large language model (LLM), can generate documentation for code snippets, based on a sample dataset of descriptions and manual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve code snippet documentation quality, especially for third-party libraries, by investigating developer-used description styles and assessing LLM-generated documentation.

Method: Manually classified 400 code snippets and their descriptions from NPM datasets, and compared original descriptions with those generated by Llama using similarity scores.

Result: Llama correctly identified 79.75% of descriptions as examples, aligning closely with manual findings. However, the generated descriptions had an average similarity score of 0.7173, signaling moderate relevance and some irrelevance.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate capacity to support code snippet documentation, but their generated descriptions have room for improvement to reach higher relevance and accuracy.

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

### [280] [cAST: Enhancing Code Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structural Chunking via Abstract Syntax Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15655)
*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure-aware chunking technique for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in code generation, leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to enhance retrieval and generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for code often suffers from quality degradation due to poor chunking practices, which disrupt semantic structures of the code.

Method: The paper proposes chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), a structure-aware method that divides large nodes and merges sibling nodes while maintaining semantic coherence.

Result: Experimentally, AST-based chunking improved retrieval Recall@5 by 4.3 points and generation Pass@1 by 2.67 points on respective benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structure-aware chunking is critical for scaling retrieval-enhanced code tasks, as it preserves semantic coherence and boosts performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: POCO is a forecasting model for neural activity that's both scalable and adaptable across various species and recording sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting neural activity for potential applications in scientific investigations and neurotechnologies.

Method: Combines a univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder, trained across multi-session datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, demonstrated biologically meaningful embeddings without anatomical labels.

Conclusion: POCO provides a generalizable solution for future modeling and adaptive neurotechnology development.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

### [282] [Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14899)
*Zihan Zhang,Lei Shi,Ding-Xuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies binary classification on the unit cube under Tsybakov noise and compositional conditions, deriving optimal convergence rates independent of input dimension $d$. ReLU DNNs trained with hinge loss can achieve these rates up to a logarithmic factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze why ReLU deep neural networks perform well in high-dimensional classification tasks and to characterize the conditions for optimal risk convergence rates.

Method: The paper assumes a compositional structure for the conditional class probability function and employs ReLU DNNs trained with a hinge loss while leveraging an oracle inequality technique to determine risk convergence rates.

Result: The paper derives an optimal convergence rate for excess 0-1 risk that is independent of input dimension $d$, and shows ReLU DNNs can achieve these rates (up to a logarithmic factor).

Conclusion: ReLU deep neural networks are theoretically justified for high-dimensional classification problems under specific compositional and Tsybakov noise conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

*Daqian Shao,Ashkan Soleymani,Francesco Quinzan,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called DML-CMR to estimate conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) using a framework that reduces bias and achieves fast convergence rates, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias caused by naively plugging in first-stage estimators into second-stage CMR estimation, especially under deep neural network regularization and overfitting issues.

Method: The method involves developing a two-stage CMR estimator following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework with a novel learning objective to mitigate bias.

Result: The DML-CMR estimator achieves a $O(N^{-1/2})$ minimax optimal convergence rate under mild conditions and outperforms existing methods in various real-world applications like IV regression and proximal causal learning.

Conclusion: DML-CMR provides an unbiased, efficient solution to CMR problems, showcasing superior performance and generalizability compared to existing estimators.

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in clustering algorithms like k-means in complex scenarios such as masked GMMs and Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Method: A theoretical approach studying Gaussian Mixture Models under noisy high-dimensional settings.

Result: Identifies conditions where k-means partitions with high probability become fixed points under high noise and limited samples.

Conclusion: k-means can fail in specific high-dimensional scenarios, prompting analysis of more complex cases in applications.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

*Gunnar König,Hidde Fokkema,Timo Freiesleben,Celestine Mendler-Dünner,Ulrike Von Luxburg*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study examines issues with algorithmic recourse explanations that become invalid due to collective behavioral changes affecting statistical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked problem of recourse explanations becoming ineffective when applicants follow them and influence statistical data, causing decision boundary changes.

Method: The paper formally analyzes conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid when confronted with performativity and identifies key variables influencing this validity.

Result: It finds recourse actions can fail when based on non-causal variables, recommending causal variables-based methods to improve reliability.

Conclusion: The paper advises against traditional counterfactual and causal methods for recourse, promoting approaches exclusively using causal variables to ensure validity.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

*Agnimitra Dasgupta,Javier Murgoitio-Esandi,Ali Fardisi,Assad A Oberai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new data-driven method to learn and model the time-dependent probability density of multivariate stochastic processes accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately estimating and modeling the time-dependent behavior of complex stochastic processes, which is fundamental to understanding and predicting real-world phenomena.

Method: The proposed method involves training a novel time-dependent binary classifier using contrastive estimation techniques. This classifier explicitly models the time-varying probability density, employs second-order derivatives of the log-density for added precision, and leverages gradient-based MCMC for sample synthesis.

Result: The approach successfully reconstructs complex, multi-modal, and near-degenerate time-dependent densities, demonstrates scalability to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method is both effective and versatile, providing accurate density approximations, new sample synthesis, and practical applications in tasks like outlier detection.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

*Xin Chen,Jason M. Klusowski,Yan Shuo Tan,Chang Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel ensemble method for sparse linear regression using randomized greedy forward selection and demonstrates its computational efficiency and performance advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational inefficiency of ensemble methods and improve the understanding of how randomization in ensembling improves predictive performance, particularly in sparse linear regression.

Method: The study introduces an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators, randomized via feature subsampling, and optimizes computational performance with dynamic programming. It also includes numerical experiments and proves theoretical properties in specific settings like orthogonal features.

Result: The method exhibits better performance than lasso and elastic net, reduces training error and degrees of freedom, and shifts the bias-variance trade-off curve. It proves to enhance model search space in specific cases.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that randomized ensembling offers benefits beyond traditional shrinkage regularization and broaden our understanding of implicit regularization in methods like random forests.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

*Clément Yvernes,Charles K. Assaad,Emilie Devijver,Eric Gaussier*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses the identifiability problem in time series for interventions using summary causal graphs and introduces conditions and efficient algorithms for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in determining whether total effects of interventions can be computed from observational data in time series, especially when only summary forms of the causal graphs are available.

Method: The study focuses on using a common backdoor set for identifiability. It derives conditions for identifiability in both consistent and inconsistent time series and develops algorithms to test identifiability efficiently.

Result: The authors establish theoretical conditions for identifiability and propose computationally limited algorithms that assess whether identifiability is achievable.

Conclusion: The paper offers a theoretical and computational framework to determine the identifiability of interventions in time series using summary causal graphs under specific conditions.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

### [289] [Next-Generation Conflict Forecasting: Unleashing Predictive Patterns through Spatiotemporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14817)
*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network for forecasting violent conflict at a high resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance without manual feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate and high-resolution forecasting of violent conflicts to support policymakers and researchers.

Method: The study proposes a Monte Carlo Dropout LSTM U-Net architecture with convolutional and recurrent layers, requiring no manual feature engineering and using only historical conflict data.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in forecasting three types of violence and provides uncertainty quantification through predictive posterior distributions.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, extensible, and promising for applications in early warning, humanitarian response, and peacebuilding.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

### [290] [Minimizing Structural Vibrations via Guided Flow Matching Design Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15263)
*Jan van Delden,Julius Schultz,Sebastian Rothe,Christian Libner,Sabine C. Langer,Timo Lüddecke*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Structural vibrations in engineering systems are reduced by optimizing plate designs with beadings using a generative flow matching model combined with a structural vibration surrogate model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of minimizing structural vibrations in systems such as cars, trains, and airplanes to enhance passenger comfort.

Method: Employing a generative flow matching model integrated with a surrogate model for predicting structural vibrations to optimize plate-like structures with beadings.

Result: The proposed method yields diverse, manufacturable plate designs that exhibit reduced structural vibrations compared to random search, heuristic designs, and genetic optimization.

Conclusion: This optimization approach is effective in exploring a broad design space and achieving low-vibration, manufacturable structural designs.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from
https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.

### [292] [Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14863)
*William MacAskill,Fin Moorhouse*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of preparing for rapid technological and political changes driven by AI advancements, termed 'grand challenges,' which necessitate proactive measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the urgent need for interventions in response to AI-driven disruptions and opportunities that might arise after an intelligence explosion.

Method: The paper outlines proactive strategies and recommendations to address challenges posed by significant technological and political shifts caused by advanced AI systems.

Result: The authors highlight the idea that addressing 'grand challenges' now could improve the prospects of managing future societal impacts effectively.

Conclusion: Preparing for an intelligence explosion extends beyond aligning AI systems, requiring a broader focus on handling the wide spectrum of impacts from emerging technologies.

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

### [293] [Hypothesis Testing for Quantifying LLM-Human Misalignment in Multiple Choice Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14997)
*Harbin Hong,Sebastian Caldas,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper develops a quantitative framework to evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) replicate human behavior in survey settings using hypothesis testing and finds gaps in their alignment with diverse population subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can effectively simulate human behavior for applications in social science research, given their increasing use in areas like economics and marketing.

Method: The authors introduce a hypothesis-testing-based framework that quantitatively measures misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behavior in multiple-choice survey responses.

Result: The study found that a popular language model struggled to simulate human opinions from tested sub-populations (e.g., different races, ages, incomes) for contentious survey questions.

Conclusion: LLMs are not fully adequate for simulating human populations in nuanced contexts, suggesting the need for better methodologies when integrating LLMs into social research.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

### [294] [Transit for All: Mapping Equitable Bike2Subway Connection using Region Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15113)
*Min Namgung,JangHyeon Lee,Fangyi Ding,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces Transit for All (TFA), a framework to improve equitable public transit access by optimizing bike-sharing systems using geospatial data and accessibility metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underserved neighborhoods in dense cities like NYC often suffer from limited transit access, leading to inequality in mobility opportunities. The authors aim to address this disparity using bike-sharing systems as a solution.

Method: The framework integrates geospatial data for bike-sharing demand prediction, novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) for enhanced transit accessibility assessment, and strategic station placement recommendations.

Result: Using NYC as a case study, the framework reveals accessibility gaps affecting low-income and minority communities. Strategic station placement based on wPTAL reduces disparities in transit access.

Conclusion: Transit for All (TFA) provides urban planners with actionable insights to enhance equitable transit and overall quality of life in marginalized urban neighborhoods.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

### [295] [FORTRESS: Frontier Risk Evaluation for National Security and Public Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14922)
*Christina Q. Knight,Kaustubh Deshpande,Ved Sirdeshmukh,Meher Mankikar,Scale Red Team,SEAL Research Team,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces FORTRESS, a dataset to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) safeguards against misuse in security-critical areas. The dataset reveals varied trade-offs in risk and utility across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to ensure LLMs are robustly safeguarded against misuse in critical security domains like CBRNE and terrorism, while also balancing their utility for benign users.

Method: The researchers created 500 adversarial prompts with rubrics, categorized across 3 domains and 10 subcategories, to objectively and robustly evaluate LLMs’ safeguard robustness. The dataset includes both malicious and benign inputs.

Result: The evaluation showed that models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet minimized risks but often over-refused benign queries, while others like Gemini 2.5 Pro performed inversely. Varying levels of risk mitigation and usability trade-offs were observed.

Conclusion: FORTRESS provides a robust framework to understand and benchmark LLMs’ safeguard robustness, aiding policymakers and researchers in comprehensively assessing model safety and usability trade-offs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

### [296] [Human Motion Capture from Loose and Sparse Inertial Sensors with Garment-aware Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15290)
*Andela Ilic,Jiaxi Jiang,Paul Streli,Xintong Liu,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces full-body pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors and proposes transformer-based diffusion models for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of human motion capture with loosely attached IMU sensors, enhancing the portability and robustness of IMU-based tracking which currently assumes tight sensor attachment.

Method: The authors simulate IMU readings from a garment-aware dataset and develop transformer-based diffusion models incorporating garment-related parameters to improve pose estimation.

Result: The proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating their effectiveness with simulated and synthetic data.

Conclusion: This study opens a new research direction in motion capture with loosely attached IMU sensors, offering better adaptability and robustness to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

*Han Wu,Junyao Li,Kangbo Zhao,Sen Zhang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a one-shot approach for face sketch synthesis using diffusion models and introduces a new benchmark dataset, OS-Sketch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for face sketch synthesis rely heavily on large datasets, which are expensive to curate and suffer from performance degradation when data is scarce.

Method: The authors use a diffusion model optimized with text instructions based on one face photo-sketch pair, followed by inference using those optimized instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method can produce realistic and consistent sketches from varied photos in a one-shot manner, surpassing existing methods in convenience and versatility.

Conclusion: The proposed approach and OS-Sketch benchmark dataset expand the boundaries of face sketch synthesis by providing a solution to data scarcity and enabling broader real-world applications.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

*Qingming Liu,Zhen Liu,Dinghuai Zhang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper presents Nabla-R2D3, a reinforcement learning framework to enhance 3D-native diffusion models through 2D rewards, aiming for better alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models struggle to match human-designed content due to limitations in textures, geometries, and alignment with human instructions.

Method: The authors introduce Nabla-R2D3, leveraging principles from Nabla-GFlowNet, to optimize 3D diffusion models using 2D reward signals and counter issues like reward hacking.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Nabla-R2D3 achieves higher rewards and avoids prior forgetting compared to baseline finetuning approaches.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3 offers a sample-efficient solution for aligning 3D models with human preferences and content quality by utilizing 2D rewards.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on deploying multiple deep learning models using Edge Impulse for real-time diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a major cause of vision impairment, and traditional diagnosis methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: Deep learning models, including MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom DNN, were trained and optimized using TensorFlow and tested on edge devices. Models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized for efficient deployment.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, SqueezeNet excelled in real-time performance, and other models like ShuffleNet and custom DNN showed moderate accuracy with resource efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable, cost-effective method for early DR detection, enabling better healthcare access in remote and resource-constrained areas.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Researchers developed FAHR-Face, a foundation model using facial images, fine-tuned for age estimation and survival risk prediction tasks related to health outcomes, particularly among cancer patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding health conditions and risks through non-invasive methods, such as facial image analysis, can provide scalable solutions in the healthcare domain.

Method: FAHR-Face was trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned separately for biological age estimation and survival risk prediction; tested for model robustness and clinical applicability on cancer patient datasets.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved high accuracy for age estimation (mean error: 5.1 years) and FAHR-FaceSurvival accurately predicted mortality risk, validated across different demographic groups and cancer subtypes.

Conclusion: Foundation models like FAHR-Face can create scalable facial biomarkers for health, enabling cost-effective and precise prognostic tools trained on small clinical datasets.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

Motivation: To identify the strengths and limitations of the Matterport Pro3 for cost-effective and accurate large-scale 3D environment reconstruction.

Method: The authors conducted 1,099 scans over six floors (17,567 sq meters) and compared the scanner's results with those from an iPhone, analyzing density and accuracy metrics.

Result: The Matterport Pro3 achieved denser point clouds (1,877,324 points vs. 506,961), higher alignment accuracy (RMSE 0.0118 meters), and reduced error (0.0408m avg. distance) compared to the iPhone.

Conclusion: The Matterport Pro3 balances cost-effectiveness and advanced performance, making it suitable for large-scale 3D modeling applications.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a
consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction.
We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building
(17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and
performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during
the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore
advanced methods to overcome them more effectively. Comparative analysis with
another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between
cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point
cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher
alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C)
average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters,
with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's
ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale
applications, leveraging features such as LiDAR and advanced alignment
techniques.

TL;DR: The study evaluates transformer models SwinUNETR and UNETR for prostate gland segmentation in MRI images and finds SwinUNETR more robust and accurate, particularly for challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shifts in prostate gland segmentation using MRI images.

Method: 546 annotated MRI volumes were used to compare SwinUNETR, UNETR, and a baseline 3D UNet under different training strategies (single cohort, cross-validated mixed, and gland size-based datasets) with hyperparameters tuned by Optuna.

Result: SwinUNETR consistently outperformed the other models, achieving the highest Dice Similarity Coefficients across most scenarios, with better performance in mitigating label noise and class imbalance.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR is a reliable and robust model for clinical prostate gland segmentation, offering significant performance improvements over CNNs using advanced self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using Recursive Variational Neural Networks (RvNN) to generate accurate and diverse 3D blood vessel models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately represent complex and varied anatomical trees for clinical and surgical applications, as existing rule-based methods fail to capture the full diversity and complexity of real vascular data.

Method: A Recursive Variational Neural Network (RvNN) was developed to learn the hierarchical structure of blood vessels, encoding branch connectivity and geometric surface features to allow for the synthesis of diverse 3D vessel models.

Result: The method generates blood vessel geometries that are both diverse and highly similar to real data, achieving accuracy in attributes like radii, length, and tortuosity, even for datasets featuring aneurysms.

Conclusion: RvNN successfully replicates complex vascular structures and provides a new way to generate realistic anatomical models for various medical applications, marking a first in this area of research.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that integrates multi-modal MRI and clinical data for neurological disorder (ND) diagnosis, achieving superior validation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Learning (DL) methods struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, resulting in subpar diagnostic performance for neurological disorders.

Method: The proposed approach uses a proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset and employs a transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to integrate multiple MRI modalities (anatomical, diffusion tensor imaging, functional) with clinical assessments. Transformer encoders capture spatial MRI relationships, while modality-specific experts extract features, combined via an adaptive gating mechanism.

Result: The framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47%, which is over 10% better than baseline approaches, and demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing overlapping disease states.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves diagnostic accuracy for neurological disorders by integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, showcasing the potential of applying multi-modal learning in clinical settings.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based classification model, tested across various datasets, to accurately classify 8 body mpMRI series types despite protocol inconsistencies and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate inefficiencies caused by incorrect DICOM header information in mpMRI exams, enabling radiologists to interpret exams more efficiently.

Method: Deep learning models, including ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet, were trained on diverse mpMRI datasets to classify 8 series types. Performance comparisons, training data quantity analysis, and external dataset evaluations were conducted.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 0.966 and accuracy of 0.972. On external datasets, it showed accuracies of 0.872 and 0.810. Larger training datasets further improved performance.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 demonstrates high and generalizable accuracy in classifying 8 mpMRI series types, making it a robust solution for improving radiological workflows across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim,Gyeongdeok Jo,Shinyoung Ra,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for homomorphic encryption inference on medical images, utilizing VQGAN for compression and polynomial approximations, enhancing efficiency while safeguarding patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging involves sensitive patient data needing robust privacy protection during analysis, especially when shared with servers for inference.

Method: The authors integrate VQGAN to compress medical images into latent representations, approximate activation functions with low-degree polynomials for HE compatibility, and adapt squeeze-and-excitation modules for optimization.

Result: The framework significantly reduced computational costs with minimal loss in accuracy, tested on chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks.

Conclusion: Despite slower HE inference compared to unencrypted methods, the approach demonstrates promising viability for privacy-preserving medical image analysis.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FedWSIDD is a federated learning approach for WSI classification that uses dataset distillation and synthetic slides to tackle resource heterogeneity and privacy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve federated learning for medical image analysis, particularly WSI classification, by addressing issues like data heterogeneity, limited resources, and privacy concerns.

Method: Proposes FedWSIDD, a federated learning paradigm that uses dataset distillation to create and share synthetic slides instead of raw data or model parameters. Includes a novel DD algorithm and stain normalization for better data representation.

Result: Experiments, including on CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 datasets, showed improved WSI classification performance, flexibility for local models, and enhanced privacy preservation.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD enables superior WSI classification, maintaining privacy and adaptability, and presents a significant advancement for collaborative medical image analysis.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

*Yu Xing,Shishi Huang,Meng Lv,Guo Chen,Huailiang Wang,Lingzhi Sui*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing noise issues in ultra-compact analog image sensors used in single-use medical endoscopes by proposing a hybrid denoising system that combines traditional and learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of processed images from single-use miniaturized endoscopes, addressing issues like reduced photon capture, constrained dynamic range, and noise, which compromise diagnostic capabilities.

Method: The authors developed a comprehensive noise model addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. They proposed a hybrid denoising system combining traditional image processing and learning-based techniques.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated effective noise reduction without detail loss or color distortion, achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and a significant PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on test datasets.

Conclusion: This hybrid denoising system effectively enhances the image quality of ultra-compact analog sensors in endoscopic applications, ensuring better diagnostic reliability while maintaining real-time processing performance.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dependency on Pap smear image quality for effective cervical cancer classification using CNNs, which is crucial for early detection and treatment especially in developing countries.

Method: The study applied three image preprocessing techniques (PMD filter, CLAHE, and the hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE) on the SIPaKMeD dataset and evaluated their effects on the performance of eight pretrained CNN models.

Result: The hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE preprocessing technique significantly improved image quality and CNN performance, yielding metric boosts such as 13.62% in accuracy and 14.34% in F1-score.

Conclusion: The hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique enhances cervical cancer classification capability, providing a valuable approach to improving automated diagnostics using CNNs.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid UNet-Transformer model to improve tumor segmentation for local MRI datasets, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.764 and IoU of 0.736.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tumor segmentation models often rely on large public datasets that lack diversity relevant to local populations. This paper aims to address this gap by developing models tailored to local clinical datasets for enhanced accuracy.

Method: The authors constructed a hybrid UNet-Transformer architecture that combines convolutional neural networks with advanced attention mechanisms like SE blocks and CBAM, trained on augmented MRI data from a local hospital using dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs.

Result: The proposed model achieved competitive performance on local MRI datasets, showing strong segmentation metrics with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and IoU of 0.736.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the necessity of developing site-specific AI models for effective clinical deployment, highlighting the importance of tailored solutions for local healthcare environments.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

### [312] [DEFORMER: Coupling Deformed Localized Patterns with Global Context for Robust End-to-end Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01732)
*Jiamin Xie,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive variant of depthwise CNNs, called "Deformer," to improve speech recognition by enabling asymmetric kernels and demonstrating better locality and attention coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitation of traditional CNNs assuming rigid and symmetric kernels, which might not optimally exploit localized time-frequency patterns in speech recognition.

Method: The authors propose replacing depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with deformable CNNs. They evaluate feature coupling through attention mechanisms and visualize receptive fields and learned kernel offsets for an improved understanding of the network.

Result: Replacing half of the depthwise CNN layers with Deformer layers led to a 5.6% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) without a language model, and a 6.4% relative improvement with a language model on the WSJ eval92 dataset.

Conclusion: Deformable CNNs (Deformer) integrate well into speech recognition architectures by improving feature associations and providing enhanced performance compared to conventional CNN-based counterparts like the Conformer.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

*Jiamin Xie,Ke Li,Jinxi Guo,Andros Tjandra,Yuan Shangguan,Leda Sari,Chunyang Wu,Junteng Jia,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive masking approach for efficient pruning of multilingual ASR models, improving sparse monolingual and multilingual outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for ASR models require multiple rounds of pruning and re-training per language, which is inefficient and resource-intensive.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive masking technique that dynamically adjusts sub-networks, avoiding fixed sub-network structures, to prune ASR models either into sparse monolingual or multilingual versions.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms traditional pruning methods, particularly in creating sparse monolingual models, and jointly trains better multilingual sub-networks.

Conclusion: Dynamic ASR Pathways present a more efficient and effective pruning approach, reducing reliance on language-specific pruning and optimizing model performance.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-resource ASR by leveraging improved regularization and augmentation strategies for better model performance.

Method: Proposed MixRep, which interpolates feature dimensions in hidden representations and combines it with time-axis regularization. It was applied to a Conformer encoder in an E2E LAS architecture.

Result: Experiments on WSJ and SWB datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, showing +6.5% and +6.7% relative WER reductions compared to a strong SpecAugment baseline.

Conclusion: MixRep improves low-resource ASR performance with simple yet effective mixup-based regularization methods, outperforming prior strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in research regarding large language models’ ability to process multi-channel audio with spatial cues.

Method: The proposed approach combines serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA) to enable the model to understand spatial audio relationships.

Result: Experimental demonstrations show the proposed method enhances speech recognition and source localization by capturing the interplay between textual and spatial cues.

Conclusion: Directional-SpeechLlama integrates spatial audio understanding into language models and achieves strong performance for directional speech tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition

TL;DR: Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC) is introduced as a unified neural speech codec with factorized linguistic bottlenecks harnessing knowledge distillation for phonetic and lexical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a speech codec that effectively bridges acoustic detail with lexical meaning using hierarchically factorized linguistic levels.

Method: HAC utilizes hierarchical bottlenecks split into acoustic, phonetic, and lexical levels, leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained encoders such as HuBERT for phonetics and LaBSE for lexical analysis.

Result: HAC achieves disentangled token representations corresponding to phonemes and word-level semantics, outperforming single-level baselines in reconstruction quality and linguistic disentanglement.

Conclusion: The study validates HAC as a robust unified discrete speech representation for tasks in speech generation and understanding by demonstrating its naturalness and interpretability.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Motivation: The study is motivated by the growing need for effective group recommendation systems as social media users increasingly participate in group activities, coupled with the observation that users' group-level and item-level interests influence each other collaboratively.

Method: The paper introduces CI4GI, which enhances user interest modeling by identifying supplementary item-level interests from group interactions and uses interest distribution distances to minimize false-negative sample interference in cross-level interest alignment.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show that CI4GI outperforms existing group identification models significantly.

Conclusion: CI4GI effectively addresses the limitations of existing group identification methods by fully modeling the collaborative evolution between dual-level user interests, leading to more accurate group recommendations.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

### [318] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework based on topological analysis to detect structural changes in public narratives around major global events, using persistent homology and graph analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of identifying moments when global events significantly alter public discourse and narrative structures.

Method: The method involves creating daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases from news articles, processing them into persistence diagrams using Vietoris-Rips filtration, and analyzing persistent homology through Wasserstein distances and persistence entropy.

Result: Findings show that geopolitical or social events cause noticeable spikes in narrative structure patterns (H0 and H1). The analysis also indicates a bottom-up cascade in semantic changes, except the Russian invasion of Ukraine which displayed top-down framing.

Conclusion: Persistent homology is effective for detecting narrative shifts unaligned with prior event knowledge, making it a valuable tool in computational social science.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

### [319] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to extract economic narratives from text compared to expert annotators and discusses its limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in extracting economic narratives using advanced tools, as existing models lack deeper semantic understanding required for economic context.

Method: The researchers used GPT-4o on articles from the Wall Street Journal and New York Times about inflation and compared its outputs with expert-generated gold-standard narratives.

Result: GPT-4o was able to extract structured economic narratives but performed below expert-level in handling complex documents.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o show promise in economic narrative extraction, but there is room for improvement and guidance is provided for future research in this area.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

*Max Ku,Sun Sun,Hongyu Guo,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: DisProtEdit is a protein editing framework that provides modular and interpretable control over protein structural and functional properties by leveraging dual-channel natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, aiming instead to create disentangled representations for better modularity and interpretability in protein editing.

Method: The method involves creating a dual-channel framework that uses structural and functional textual descriptions of proteins, a custom dataset (SwissProtDis), and techniques such as alignment, uniformity objectives, and disentanglement losses to align and separate embeddings.

Result: DisProtEdit performs competitively on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks and achieves a 61.7% success rate on a new multi-attribute editing benchmark, demonstrating its ability to coordinate simultaneous structural and functional edits.

Conclusion: DisProtEdit advances the field by enabling interpretable and controllable protein editing, providing a novel framework capable of disentangled editing of structural and functional properties.

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: math.MG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a boundary-weighted operator that adapts to tree-like, hierarchical graph structures by rescaling edges using geometric properties. It ensures stability and offers a novel approach for signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of designing graph filters for hierarchical graphs with tree-like branching patterns.

Method: A boundary-weighted operator based on Busemann functions and delta-hyperbolic networks is introduced. The operator's spectral norm and energy decay are proven analytically.

Result: The operator filters signals by implementing curvature-controlled energy reduction with stable, parameter-free performance.

Conclusion: The new operator serves as a geometry-driven, lightweight tool for processing signals on graphs with hierarchical structures.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized GOSPA metric for evaluating multi-object tracking with trajectory and track-level uncertainties, computable in polynomial time via linear programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a better evaluation metric for multi-object tracking systems by addressing both trajectory and track-level uncertainties, improving interpretability and computational efficiency.

Method: The generalized metric builds upon probabilistic GOSPA, extends TGOSPA, and is framed as a multidimensional assignment problem with polynomial-time linear programming relaxation.

Result: The new metric retains TGOSPA's interpretability, decomposes into intuitive error components, and its utility is validated through simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed metric effectively measures tracking performance under uncertainty, offering clarity and computational feasibility for practical use.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an OCR-based speech synthesis system implemented using LabVIEW to enhance book accessibility for visually impaired individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face difficulties accessing books of their choice; current solutions like Braille or audio recordings from NGOs are insufficient.

Method: The system uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology alongside LabVIEW to convert text into speech for better accessibility.

Result: Developed a cost-effective, accurate, reliable, and user-friendly speech synthesis system for visually impaired persons.

Conclusion: The proposed OCR-based LabVIEW system improves accessibility to books, addressing limitations in existing approaches for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

*Anuradha Chopra,Abhinaba Roy,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SonicVerse, a multi-task music captioning model that integrates music feature detection to generate detailed captions for music pieces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance music databases and AI research through detailed music captions by capturing both low-level and high-level music attributes.

Method: Developed SonicVerse with a projection-based architecture, integrating audio input transformation into language tokens and auxiliary music feature detection heads.

Result: The approach improves music captioning quality, generating rich, detailed captions using an enhanced MusicBench dataset annotated with music features.

Conclusion: Incorporating music feature detection leads to better, more descriptive captions, advancing music AI and enabling detailed, time-informed descriptions of music.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

*Zachary J. Ruff,Damon B. Lesmeister*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring is used to study wildlife through automated recording units (ARUs) and involves automating the processing of massive datasets generated by such means. A proposed workflow, pycnet-audio, aids in efficiently detecting various species and noises using expanded models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge of processing vast datasets generated during wildlife acoustic monitoring efficiently, as manual analysis is impractical.

Method: The paper introduces pycnet-audio, a processing workflow built around the expanded PNW-Cnet model, which supports automatic detection of a wide range of species and noises from acoustic recordings.

Result: The expanded model can now detect vocalizations of approximately 80 forest wildlife species along with various anthropogenic and environmental noises, enhancing the scope of wildlife monitoring.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio and the upgraded PNW-Cnet model provide an effective solution for handling and analyzing large-scale acoustic datasets for ecological and wildlife research purposes.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three models for speech enhancement: U-Net excels in noise reduction; CMGAN leads in perceptual quality; Wave-U-Net retains speaker-specific features best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve speech enhancement techniques, particularly balancing noise elimination, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific features.

Method: The study benchmarks Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net models on diverse datasets, analyzing their performance in noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition.

Result: U-Net showed superior noise suppression; CMGAN achieved the best perceptual quality (PESQ scores); Wave-U-Net performed well in maintaining speaker-specific features (VeriSpeak scores).

Conclusion: These models excel differently: U-Net for noise suppression, CMGAN for perceptual speech quality, and Wave-U-Net for speaker feature retention, advancing use in voice-related applications.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using pretrained text-to-music diffusion models to edit musical instruments in audio tracks without altering the original content or retraining the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in controlling text-to-music generation outputs and achieving precise results motivated the authors to explore instrument editing within audio tracks using existing diffusion models.

Method: The proposed method identifies an optimal intermediate timestep in the model’s generation process, using an instrument classifier, to enable instrument editing while preserving original audio content.

Result: The method effectively balances preserving the structure of the original audio with achieving the desired instrument edit, without requiring additional training or slowing down the generation process.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that text-to-music diffusion models can be utilized for creative audio editing tasks, offering precise control without compromising efficiency or quality.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of reproducibility and evaluation fragmentation in Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) by proposing a unified software framework.

Method: BMFM-RNA integrates diverse pretraining and fine-tuning tasks into one framework, introducing WCED training objective for capturing global gene expression patterns, and validates the framework through experiments on CELLxGENE datasets.

Result: BMFM-RNA, using WCED training objective, achieves performance on par or better than state-of-the-art models like scGPT across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA marks progress in TFM research by offering a reproducible benchmark framework and enabling community exploration for enhanced TFM training strategies.

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address skepticism regarding the practical advantages of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) over classical methods, especially given the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Method: The study systematically evaluates twelve QNN configurations by combining two quantum feature maps with six entanglement strategies for ansatz design and tests their performance on a wind energy dataset.

Result: QNNs using the Z feature map achieved up to 93% prediction accuracy in forecasting wind power output, outperforming classical methods on the dataset.

Conclusion: The results underscore that QNNs have meaningful potential for real-world applications, highlighting the promise of Quantum Machine Learning methods despite technological limitations.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy

by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel regularization approach for quantum machine learning (QML) optimization to address circuit cutting challenges on NISQ devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the severe limitations of NISQ hardware, especially in terms of circuit depth and connectivity, which hinder validating quantum advantage and further empirical investigations.

Method: A new regularization term is introduced in the QML optimization process to penalize sampling overhead, allowing the optimizer to balance circuit cutting advantages with maintaining QML model accuracy.

Result: The approach enables efficient optimization by managing the trade-off between circuit cutting overhead and QML model accuracy, thereby supporting larger and more complex problem scenarios.

Conclusion: This method advances QML by making it viable to work on larger complex problems while balancing the constraints of current quantum hardware, contributing to the pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone
of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful
application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new loss function, DrRL, that generalizes and improves upon Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) for recommendation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of SL and CCL in recommendation systems by exploring their theoretical connections and proposing a robust alternative.

Method: The authors employ Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO) with Rényi-divergence and develop DrRL, optimizing its design by integrating strengths of SL and CCL.

Result: DrRL mitigates the sensitivity of SL to false negatives and maximizes the data utilization lacking in CCL, leading to improved recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: DrRL overcomes key drawbacks of SL and CCL, demonstrating enhanced performance and robustness in recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### [333] [CNN-Enabled Scheduling for Probabilistic Real-Time Guarantees in Industrial URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14987)
*Eman Alqudah,Ashfaq Khokhar*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism to enhance interference coordination and resource allocation in industrial wireless networks, achieving significant SINR gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks requires advanced methods for interference coordination across multi-cell, multi-channel systems.

Method: The authors enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and graph coloring to dynamically assign link priorities based on real-time network conditions. Training is done offline to minimize real-time overhead.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate SINR gains of up to 113%, 94%, and 49% over the standard LDP across three different network configurations, showing notable improvements in network quality and resource utilization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly boosts network capacity, SINR, and schedulability while introducing minimal overhead, making it a viable solution for complex URLLC scenarios in industrial wireless networks.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Result: Simulation results show up to 197.4% SINR improvement over the Local Deadline Partition algorithm and up to 84.7% improvement over a CNN-based model.

Conclusion: The GCN-DQN model effectively enhances URLLC requirements, delivering high network performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in
multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our
approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand,
network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference
patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive
scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show
that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and
175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN
model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over
our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results
underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC
requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.

### [335] [Generative thermodynamic computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15121)
*Stephen Whitelam*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative modeling framework based on thermodynamic computing using Langevin dynamics, aiming to generate structured data naturally and minimize heat emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an alternative generative model leveraging physical thermodynamic systems to naturally synthesize structured data without external control or artificial noise.

Method: The framework utilizes Langevin dynamics for natural time evolution in a thermodynamic computer, training it by maximizing the reverse probability of noising trajectories.

Result: The framework was demonstrated in a simulated digital thermodynamic computer, showcasing its potential to generate structured data efficiently.

Conclusion: Analog hardware implementation could enable generative models to function naturally without external noise or denoising control, combining computational efficiency with reduced heat emission.

Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in
which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution
of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional
diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information
needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a
thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with
which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures
that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate
this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If
realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model
that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected
noise or active control of denoising.

*David Leprich,Mario Rosenfelder,Mario Hermle,Jingshan Chen,Peter Eberhard*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based path-following approach applied to quadrotors like Crazyflie, introducing a corridor-based method for flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating drone processes is challenging due to the limitations of existing path-following solutions, such as lack of state/input constraint handling or applicability only to linear systems.

Method: The authors extended an MPC-based path-following framework with a cascaded control structure for real-time quadrotor control, applied it to Crazyflie hardware, and introduced a corridor-based extension to avoid overly rigid path adherence.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrated the method's operational effectiveness and highlighted its novel application to quadrotors.

Conclusion: The proposed MPC-based approach successfully addressed key challenges in quadrotor path-following, offering innovative solutions like corridor-following for real-time applications.

Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on
trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control
is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural
approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different
solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack
the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated
in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems.
To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive
Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the
Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded
control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in
the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging
real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the
best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based
path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the
original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise
following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following
approach is presented.

*Bahram Yaghooti,Chengyu Li,Bruno Sinopoli*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to learn fractional-order nonlinear systems using input-output data and orthonormal basis functions, emphasizing its superiority over integer-order models in capturing long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in accurately modeling fractional-order nonlinear systems, which possess memory-dependent properties and cannot be adequately represented by integer-order systems.

Method: The framework involves two steps: (1) designing input-output experiments to collect datasets for system dynamics, and (2) utilizing the datasets and memory-dependent property to estimate fractional order and reconstruct vector fields using orthonormal basis functions.

Result: The algorithm was validated on four benchmark fractional-order systems and proved to accurately learn dynamics. Comparisons showed fractional-order models are superior to integer-order models in representing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models fractional-order systems and highlights the advantages of fractional-order representations over traditional integer-order models.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimBank, a simulation tool for benchmarking Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in the PresPM literature, including inadequate technique comparisons and evaluation methods.

Method: Develop a simulator modeled after loan processing in banks to evaluate PresPM methods across diverse intervention problems and machine learning challenges.

Result: SimBank allows extensive comparisons, enables true outcome generation for each action, and demonstrates robustness in benchmarking capabilities.

Conclusion: SimBank is a valuable publicly available tool for advancing PresPM research and addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm for solving Entropic Optimal Transport with improved convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing Sinkhorn algorithm suffers from exponential slow-down in convergence as regularization weakens.

Method: The authors leverage spectral insights on the Hessian's behavior and propose a spectral warm-start strategy to address convergence issues.

Result: The modified algorithm demonstrates faster convergence compared to the traditional Sinkhorn method in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral warm-start strategy effectively mitigates slow-down issues, enhancing the efficiency of Entropic Optimal Transport solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an accelerated version for the Sinkhorn algorithm,
which is the reference method for computing the solution to Entropic Optimal
Transport.
  Its main draw-back is the exponential slow-down of convergence as the
regularization weakens $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.
  Thanks to spectral insights on the behavior of the Hessian, we propose to
mitigate the problem via an original spectral warm-start strategy. This leads
to faster convergence compared to the reference method, as also demonstrated in
our numerical experiments.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper studies the self-attention structures in transformers using theoretical and computational methods, enabling interpretability and practical applications like pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and leverage the intrinsic and extrinsic structures of the self-attention mechanism in transformers for interpretability and practical applications.

Method: The authors combined paradifferential calculus for theoretical exploration and hierarchical tensor organization (using partition trees and bases) to analyze the network structure.

Result: The study demonstrated both qualitative (visualization) and quantitative (sparsity metrics) evaluations of network structures in transformers, and explored applications in vision and language models.

Conclusion: This work contributes to interpretability and highlights practical uses, like model pruning and architecture comparisons, via analyzing self-attention structures.

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Counterbalance estimator to compute matrix spectral norms using matrix-vector products, offering tighter bounds compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved methods to estimate matrix spectral norms efficiently with better approximation guarantees, particularly in deep learning and inverse problems.

Method: The paper proposes the Counterbalance estimator, which computes upper bounds on spectral norms using matrix-vector products and provides probabilistic guarantees against underestimation.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the Counterbalance estimator is more effective than the power method, especially for matrices with fast-decaying spectra.

Conclusion: The Counterbalance estimator shows promise in estimating spectral norms more accurately, particularly benefiting applications in deep learning and inverse problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using
only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that
provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its
underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the
proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both
synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for
matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and
inverse problems.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores training strategies for Machine-learning force fields, focusing on the benefits of pre-training for improving molecular dynamics simulation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are precise but computationally intensive; MLFFs offer a faster alternative, and this paper aims to enhance accuracy and simulation stability.

Method: GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, was trained directly on MD17 and pre-trained on the OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17.

Result: The pre-trained model demonstrated significantly improved simulation stability, achieving trajectories up to three times longer than direct training methods.

Conclusion: Pre-training on large datasets enhances simulation stability, showing the need for metrics beyond force MAE in assessing MLFF performance.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces deepSURF, a tool combining static analysis and AI-guided fuzzing to detect memory safety bugs in Rust unsafe code, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools struggle to detect Rust memory safety issues due to limitations in handling Rust-specific types, inadequate detection capabilities, and dependency on manual processes.

Method: The study integrates static analysis with LLM-guided fuzzing harness generation. It also replaces generics with custom types, customizes trait implementations, and dynamically augments fuzzing harnesses using LLMs to improve detection.

Result: deepSURF was tested on 27 real-world Rust crates, rediscovering 20 known vulnerabilities and discovering 6 previously unknown issues, outperforming current tools.

Conclusion: deepSURF is an effective improvement over existing approaches and demonstrates its value for enhancing the detection of memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, particularly for unsafe code.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores indirect data poisoning on large language models by introducing secret sequences using a novel technique, enabling tracing dataset usage effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in tracing dataset usage during LLM pre-training and introducing a way to protect datasets via indirect data poisoning.

Method: The paper uses gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning to train models to learn secret sequences absent from the training data.

Result: Less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens suffices to make a language model covertly learn a secret with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$), without degrading model performance.

Conclusion: Indirect data poisoning is feasible, allows dataset protection and tracing with high confidence, and can occur without secrets being present in training or affecting LLM benchmarks.

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm for differentially private continual counting in scenarios where the input size isn't pre-known, improving error smoothness and space/time efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current algorithms for differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting, such as suboptimal error and the need for pre-knowledge of input size.

Method: The paper proposes novel matrix factorizations using logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$, enabling smooth error and improved variance, space, and time complexity.

Result: The new algorithm achieves smooth error with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance, using $O(t)$ space and $O(\log t)$ amortized time per round, outperforming the variance and space usage of the bounded-input algorithm by Henzinger et al.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is effective for unbounded continual counting, with theoretical improvements and competitive empirical performance compared to existing optimal methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

TL;DR: AI/ML integration in medical devices boosts healthcare capabilities but raises significant cybersecurity risks, with potential safety impacts on patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the cybersecurity risks inherent in AI/ML-enabled medical devices due to their complexity, interconnectivity, and vulnerabilities.

Method: Analyzing device recalls, adverse events, and vulnerabilities to understand threats, and introducing tools for premarket security assessments.

Result: Developed a suite of tools for aiding security analysts in evaluating and minimizing risks in pre-market phases of medical devices.

Conclusion: Embedding cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices is essential for ensuring patient safety.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

*Samhita Kuili,Mohammadreza Amini,Burak Kantarci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses jamming attacks in 5G-NR networks using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) for detection on heterogeneous data, augmented with Conv1D CWGAN-GP for handling class imbalance and evaluated against benchmark models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the detection of over-the-air jamming attacks compromising the signal quality in 5G-NR networks, especially in heterogeneous datasets with class imbalances.

Method: Simulated jamming environments with AWGN on OFDM datasets, employed CAE for jamming detection, utilized Conv1D CWGAN-GP for dataset balancing, and compared CAE performance against CDAE and CSAE.

Result: The CAE model achieved strong detection metrics: 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy, showcasing robustness over benchmark models.

Conclusion: The CAE method is robust and effective for detecting jammed signals in complex and heterogeneous 5G-NR datasets, outperforming alternative models.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

TL;DR: Gradient distortions negatively impact MRI image quality, especially in non-Cartesian imaging. This paper proposes using convolutional networks to predict these distortions and improve reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient distortions in non-Cartesian MRI sequences cause artifacts and degrade image quality, prompting the need for better predictive models.

Method: A temporal convolutional network was trained using measured gradient waveforms from an imaging system to predict distortions in the MRI gradient system.

Result: The trained network accurately predicted nonlinear distortions and enhanced image quality in reconstruction and diffusion parameter mapping.

Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks outperform traditional linear models for gradient behavior prediction and can correct errors retrospectively in MRI imaging.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

*Arbind Agrahari Baniya,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Peter W. Eklund,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces S3PO, an advanced model for enhancing the resolution of 360° videos, which leverages deep learning and focuses on spherical distortions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 360° videos suffer from spatial resolution limitations and visual quality issues caused by equirectangular projection distortions. Existing deep learning-based VSR methods for conventional videos are not optimized for these challenges.

Method: The authors propose a novel model called S3PO (Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation). It utilizes recurrent modeling with an attention mechanism, a purpose-built feature extractor, and a novel loss function tailored for spherical distortion correction.

Result: S3PO outperforms state-of-the-art conventional VSR and 360° VSR models on 360° video datasets. An ablation study highlights its architectural components' effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the superiority of S3PO for 360° video super-resolution and provides a novel dataset, suggesting it as a robust tool for enhancing immersive video experiences.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Motivation: The field of protein foundation models lacks comprehensive benchmarks for fair evaluation and understanding, limiting insights into task relationships and model performance.

Method: The authors developed PFMBench, conducting experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks spanning 8 critical areas of protein science.

Result: PFMBench discovered correlations between tasks, identified top-performing models, and established a standardized evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: PFMBench provides valuable insights into protein foundation models, aiding in their understanding, evaluation, and future development.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a
streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at

### [354] [Proximal Operators of Sorted Nonconvex Penalties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15315)
*Anne Gagneux,Mathurin Massias,Emmanuel Soubies*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper studies sparse signal recovery using sorted nonsmooth penalties, providing an efficient approach for computing the proximal operator in both weakly convex and nonconvex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve variable clustering and reduce coefficient shrinkage in sparse signal recovery through the use of sorted nonsmooth penalties.

Method: The authors focus on sorted nonconvex penalties, generalizing SLOPE, and propose algorithms (e.g., PAV and its modification) for efficiently computing the proximal operator in weakly convex and nonconvex cases.

Result: The approach achieves efficient computation of the proximal operator and offers theoretical insights into nonconvex minimizers. Practical effectiveness is illustrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The study establishes sorted nonsmooth penalties as a useful tool for generalized linear models, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

### [355] [Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding for Distributed Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15387)
*Junhui Zhang,Patrick Jaillet*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces two multi-timescale optimization methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed systems: MT-GS and AMT-GS, achieving optimal complexities and reducing communication rounds through novel approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distributed convex optimization challenges where local objectives are similar, minimize communication costs, and optimize non-smooth functions.

Method: Introduced Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS) using a block-decomposable primal-dual approach with sliding method enhancements.

Result: MT-GS achieves $O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps; AMT-GS optimizes further to $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps.

Conclusion: The proposed methods achieve optimal complexity while addressing the non-smooth distributed optimization challenges, answering an open question regarding communication-round dependency.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

*Jaehong Chung,Michael Manga,Timothy Kneafsey,Tapan Mukerji,Mengsu Hu*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a transformer-based deep learning model to forecast microearthquake (MEQ) evolution during subsurface fluid injections, achieving high accuracy and providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the ability to forecast microearthquake spatiotemporal evolution during geo-engineering applications, which is critical for understanding stress states, permeability, and seismic risk mitigation.

Method: The proposed model uses a transformer-based deep learning architecture to analyze hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ data, predicting metrics like cumulative MEQ count, seismic moment, and spatial cloud extents with uncertainty evaluation.

Result: The model showed high accuracy with $R^2 >0.98$ for 1-second forecasts and $R^2 >0.88$ for 15-second forecasts, validated on the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset.

Conclusion: The results highlight the model's potential to enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and seismic risk, showcasing its value for applications like CO2 sequestration and enhanced geothermal systems.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

*Tobias Labarta,Nhi Hoang,Katharina Weitz,Wojciech Samek,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Leander Weber*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CUE model linking explanation properties to cognitive subprocesses in Explainable AI (XAI), and highlights challenges in creating accessible explanations for visually impaired users through an empirical study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine learning systems play a growing role in decision-making, there is a pressing need for human-understandable explanations, particularly for marginalized groups like visually impaired individuals, yet current evaluations often overlook cognitive accessibility.

Method: The authors propose the CUE model that connects explanation properties to cognitive subprocesses and empirically test the model through a study (N=455) evaluating heatmaps with different colormaps to assess their impact on visually impaired users' confidence, effort, and understanding.

Result: Findings show comparable task performance among users but reveal lower confidence and higher effort for visually impaired participants, even with accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis, challenging assumptions about perceptual optimization in XAI interfaces.

Conclusion: The study validates the CUE model, underscores the limitations of existing accessibility-focused approaches, and calls for adaptive, user-tailored XAI solutions that better support diverse user needs.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of AI technologies necessitates a better understanding of human interaction with XAI, but current tools for building experimental interfaces lack standardization and reusability.

Method: The authors designed and implemented WebXAII, a flexible web-based platform that allows researchers to define experimental protocols using a structured configuration file, minimizing the need for programming skills.

Result: WebXAII successfully reproduced the protocol of a state-of-the-art study, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility in embodying experimental protocols.

Conclusion: WebXAII simplifies the process of conducting XAI interaction experiments and promotes standardization, reusability, and reproducibility in XAI research.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tool leveraging the CLIP model for analyzing character representations in media based on age and gender, paired with visualizations, and investigates public trust and perceived usefulness via a user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to evaluate the practical usefulness and trustworthiness of AI-generated demographic analytics for character representation in media and how these can be effectively presented to a general audience through visualization.

Method: The authors developed a tool based on the CLIP model to analyze screen data for age and gender representation, created visualizations for the analytics, and conducted a user study to measure understanding, trust, and utility of the tool.

Result: Participants found the visualizations understandable and useful, suggesting a demand for additional demographic and contextual details. Trust in the AI-based models was moderate to low, indicating skepticism despite overall acceptance of the approach.

Conclusion: While the tool demonstrates potential in providing actionable media analysis, improvements in model accuracy, inclusion of broader demographic data, and increased transparency are needed to build greater public trust.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured approach to intent communication for human-robot collaboration in workspaces, using a multidimensional design space based on the SAT framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve trust, safety, and efficiency in human-robot collaborative workspaces by ensuring effective mutual understanding.

Method: The authors build upon the SAT framework and task abstraction levels to formulate a multidimensional design space that includes intent content, planning horizons, and communication modalities.

Result: The proposed design space offers guidance for developing multimodal communication strategies in dynamic collaborative work environments.

Conclusion: The paper lays a conceptual foundation for a design toolkit to enhance transparent human-robot interaction, addressing open questions and challenges for hybrid work environments.

Abstract: As robots enter collaborative workspaces, ensuring mutual understanding
between human workers and robotic systems becomes a prerequisite for trust,
safety, and efficiency. In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation
scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform
assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication.
Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework
and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design
space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to
strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this
space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to
dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual
foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent
human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and
design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and
trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.

TL;DR: This paper highlights challenges in deploying AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects, focusing on structural, communication, and operational barriers. It provides actionable strategies based on interviews and lived experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address barriers preventing AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects from achieving real-world impact and transition beyond proof-of-concept to scalable solutions.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers and applied thematic analysis, complemented by the authors' own experiences.

Result: Identified structural, organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key deployment barriers. Synthesized best practices and actionable strategies.

Conclusion: This work serves as a reference guide for AI4SI researchers and organizations, providing strategies to address deployment barriers and foster effective collaboration.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline integrating DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset to enhance AI-generated interior designs with sustainability metrics, enabling designers to evaluate environmental impacts through CO2e data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI produces visually appealing designs but often lacks actionable sustainability data for designers. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A pipeline integrates the DALL-E 3 model with a materials dataset, identifying top materials in AI-generated designs and linking them to CO2e values for users. The system is tested in three user scenarios with varying sustainability focus.

Result: When sustainability metrics are integrated into outputs, users make more informed design decisions. However, it can lead to decision fatigue and reduced satisfaction, though overall incorporation of sustainability principles increased.

Conclusion: Integrating sustainability metrics into generative AI designs can steer architects toward eco-friendly practices, though care must be taken to mitigate user fatigue and maintain satisfaction.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

TL;DR: The paper examines the potential of Carey, a GPT-4-based chatbot, in addressing the needs of Alzheimer's caregivers through informational and emotional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's and Related Dementia face stress, anxiety, and depression. The motivation behind this paper is to explore how generative AI can fill the gap in providing emotional and logistical support to caregivers.

Method: The researchers developed a GPT-4-based chatbot called Carey. They conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 16 caregivers after scenario-driven interactions with Carey and analyzed the data using inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: The study identified six key themes reflecting caregiver needs: on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. It also highlighted tensions between caregivers’ desires and concerns for each theme.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into caregiver needs and offer design recommendations for creating caregiver-centered AI systems. This study aims to assist the development of proactive and trustworthy AI technologies that support caregivers' mental health.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guide to help analysts and researchers reliably perform visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques by aiding in paper selection and expertise assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novice analysts and researchers face challenges due to the extensive literature and the unreliability of DR-based visual analytics caused by distortions in representing original data.

Method: A classification of existing literature was utilized to create a guide that supports users in assessing their DR expertise and selecting appropriate resources. This guide's significance and utility were validated via expert interviews.

Result: The proposed guide was validated by three DR and data visualization experts, who confirmed its significance, usefulness, and comprehensiveness.

Conclusion: The guide is a valuable resource to enhance reliability and understanding in DR-based visual analytics for both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

### [367] [Co-Creative Learning via Metropolis-Hastings Interaction between Humans and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15468)
*Ryota Okumura,Tadahiro Taniguchi,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces co-creative learning, where humans and AI construct shared external representations through mutual integration of their knowledge. Using a Metropolis-Hastings naming game model, the study shows that human-AI pairs improved categorization accuracy and aligned on a shared sign system, highlighting a promising direction for symbiotic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unilateral knowledge transfer in AI teaching by integrating human and AI perceptual experiences and knowledge, creating symbiotic systems.

Method: The authors employed a human-AI interaction model using the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG). In an experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game with different types of computer agents under partial observability.

Result: Human-AI pairs with MH-based agents significantly improved categorization accuracy and formed a shared sign system, with human behavior closely aligning with MH-derived acceptance probabilities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of co-creative learning between humans and AI, paving the way for symbiotic AI systems that learn collaboratively with humans by aligning perceptual experiences.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

*Wenqi Guan,Yang Fang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system to improve remote learning resource retrieval by incorporating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework, emphasizing precision, contextual relevance, and student needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for retrieving remote learning resources are insufficient in delivering deep contextual responses to complex student queries, necessitating improvement to better support remote learners.

Method: The authors integrate GPT-based language models with the LangChain framework and employ CoT (Chain of Thought) reasoning alongside prompt engineering techniques to enhance resource retrieval.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates better precision, relevance, and contextually enriched results, leading to higher user satisfaction and improved learning outcomes compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced language models and tailored frameworks can significantly enhance the learning experience for remote students by providing more appropriate and contextually rich resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote
learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current
retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work
proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating
GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a
more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

*Luigi Sibille,Torodd Skjerve Nord,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This study uses Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on ferry quays to monitor structural health and creates a Digital Twin by integrating experimental data and physics-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ferry quays degrade rapidly due to harsh environments and ferry impacts, necessitating effective monitoring strategies that overcome practical limitations such as sparse sensor placement.

Method: The Physics-Encoded Machine Learning approach integrates a reduced-order structural model and GPLFM to estimate the structural response, addressing challenges like unknown impact forces and sparse sensors.

Result: The GPLFM provided accurate response estimates in most locations but lower accuracy near the impact zone; sensor placement and other sensitivity parameters were analyzed to optimize estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The GP latent forces demonstrate robustness with modeling and measurement uncertainties, offering a viable path for establishing Digital Twins and improving ferry quay structural health monitoring.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

### [370] [LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167)
*Wanzhe Wang,Jianqiu Peng,Menghao Hu,Weihuang Zhong,Tong Zhang,Shuai Wang,Yixin Zhang,Mingjie Shao,Wanli Ni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a large language model (LLM) agent for automatically tuning hyper-parameters in a communication algorithm, achieving better performance than human and random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyper-parameter tuning methods for the WS-PSO-CM algorithm lack automation and exhibit unsatisfactory performance.

Method: The authors design an LLM agent that uses an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) to autonomously tune hyper-parameters and integrate it with the existing WS-PSO-CM algorithm.

Result: The experiment shows the LLM agent achieves higher minimal sum-rate performance compared to human heuristics and random hyper-parameter generation.

Conclusion: The LLM agent proves to be effective for automatic hyper-parameter tuning, introducing higher performance levels to UAV trajectory and communication algorithms.

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

*Matteo Zecchin,Tomer Raviv,Dileep Kalathil,Krishna Narayanan,Nir Shlezinger,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes gradient-free adaptation strategies using in-context learning (ICL) for wireless receiver optimization, eliminating the need for online retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based wireless receivers effectively adapt to complex environments, but current adaptation strategies are either inflexible or require computationally expensive gradient descent optimization.

Method: The paper employs ICL using architectural models like Transformers and structured state-space models (SSMs) to achieve gradient-free adaptation for wireless receivers.

Result: ICL is demonstrated theoretically and empirically to support real-time adaptation in cell-free massive MIMO networks using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual data.

Conclusion: ICL offers an efficient, principled method for wireless receiver adaptation, bypassing the need for traditional online retraining methods.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

### [372] [MODS: Multi-source Observations Conditional Diffusion Model for Meteorological State Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14798)
*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces MODS, a model to improve downscaling of meteorological variables. By utilizing multi-source satellite and topographical data, MODS generates more realistic and accurate high-resolution weather information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current downscaling methods for meteorological data are limited by relying primarily on geostationary satellite data, which cannot capture all changes in meteorological variables comprehensively.

Method: MODS employs a conditional diffusion model, integrating multi-source satellite data and topographic data through a multi-source cross-attention module, while being pre-trained on the ERA5 dataset. It uses station-level data during sampling for enhanced consistency.

Result: MODS consistently downscaled ERA5 meteorological maps to a high resolution of 6.25 km with improved fidelity and alignment to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: MODS effectively addresses limitations in current downscaling methods by leveraging diverse datasets and advanced modeling approaches, yielding more accurate meteorological information at finer resolutions.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.
