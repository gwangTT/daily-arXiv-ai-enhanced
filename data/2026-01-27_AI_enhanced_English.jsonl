Still, standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents tend to rely on fixed learning rates and uniform update scaling, even as updates are modulated by temporal-difference (TD) error.

We introduce Deep Intrinsic Surprise-Regularized Control (DISRC), a biologically inspired augmentation to DQN that dynamically scales Q-updates based on latent-space surprise. DISRC encodes states via a LayerNorm-based encoder and computes a deviation-based surprise score relative to a moving latent setpoint. Each update is then scaled in proportion to both TD error and surprise intensity, promoting plasticity during early exploration and stability as familiarity increases. We evaluate DISRC on two sparse-reward MiniGrid environments, which included MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8 and MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1, under identical settings as a vanilla DQN baseline. In DoorKey, DISRC reached the first successful episode (reward > 0.8) 33% faster than the vanilla DQN baseline (79 vs. 118 episodes), with lower reward standard deviation (0.25 vs. 0.34) and higher reward area under the curve (AUC: 596.42 vs. 534.90). These metrics reflect faster, more consistent learning - critical for sparse, delayed reward settings. In LavaCrossing, DISRC achieved a higher final reward (0.95 vs. 0.93) and the highest AUC of all agents (957.04), though it converged more gradually. These preliminary results establish DISRC as a novel mechanism for regulating learning intensity in off-policy agents, improving both efficiency and stability in sparse-reward domains.

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks.

Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components.

Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.\n  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code.

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $\u03b2$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $\u03b3(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $\u03c1$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $\u03b1_\u03c1$ (combining $\u03b3(m)$, $\u03c1$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>\u03b2$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting.

TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks.

To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure.

Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings.

Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices.

This paper presents a unified and complete Kantorovich duality theory for MOT problem on general Polish product spaces with bounded continuous cost function. For marginal compact spaces, the duality identity is derived through a convex-analytic reformulation, that identifies the dual problem as a Fenchel-Rockafellar conjugate. We obtain dual attainment and show that optimal potentials may always be chosen in the class of $c$-conjugate families, thereby extending classical two-marginal conjugacy principle into a genuinely multimarginal setting. In non-compact setting, where direct compactness arguments are unavailable, we recover duality via a truncation-tightness procedure based on weak compactness of multimarginal transference plans and boundedness of the cost. We prove that the dual value is preserved under restriction to compact subsets and that admissible dual families can be regularized into uniformly bounded $c$-conjugate potentials. The argument relies on a refined use of $c$-splitting sets and their equivalence with multimarginal $c$-cyclical monotonicity. We then obtain dual attainment and exact primal-dual equality for MOT on arbitrary Polish spaces, together with a canonical representation of optimal dual potentials by $c$-conjugacy.

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline.

At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.\n  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions.

Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP.

To aid such decisions, we propose a diagnostic tool for contrasting global regression models and patient-specific (local) regression models. The core utility of this tool is to identify where and for whom a global model may be inadequate. We focus on regression models and specifically suggest a localized regression approach that identifies regions in the predictor space where patients are not well represented by the global model. As localization becomes challenging when dealing with many predictors, we propose modeling in a dimension-reduced latent representation obtained from an autoencoder. Using such a neural network architecture for dimension reduction enables learning a latent representation simultaneously optimized for both good data reconstruction and for revealing local outcome-related associations suitable for robust localized regression.

This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework to optimize communication-computation-control loops for fast and robust fault detection and recovery in robotic systems.", "motivation": "Existing fault detection and recovery (FDR) frameworks face limitations such as delays and unreliability due to design disconnects between communication, computation, and control mechanisms.", "method": "The GoC framework jointly designs communication, computation, and control loops.

In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines.

However, existing GAD methods follow a \"one model per dataset\" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a \"one-for-all\" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by \"flattening\" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime.

First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices influence cross-domain generalization for generalist LLM agents, introducing low-overhead techniques and insights towards improving out-of-domain robustness.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the challenge where generalist LLM agents, typically trained in narrow environments, struggle in broader unseen domains during deployment.", "method": "The authors analyze properties of RL environments, such as state information richness and planning complexity, and introduce randomization techniques to increase robustness.

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges. To optimize evolutionary efficiency, we further introduce a Parallel Batch Evolution strategy. Empirical evaluations across five diverse benchmarks under a zero-start setting demonstrate significant performance gains over proprietary baselines. Additionally, complementary warm-start evaluations confirm that the accumulated general knowledge can be seamlessly transferred to novel domains.

However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization.

While recent Transformer-based models such as Swin UNETR have achieved impressive benchmark performance, their clinical utility is often compromised by two critical issues: sensitivity to missing modalities (common in clinical practice) and a lack of confidence calibration. Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showing that the joint application of MMD and causal adjacency constraints yields a 1.88\\% reduction in estimation error.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces KGCM-VAE to quantify the causal relationship between sea ice thickness and sea surface height (SSH) for understanding polar climate change.", "motivation": "Conventional models face challenges in estimating treatment effects in spatiotemporal data due to unobserved confounders and lack of physical constraints.", "method": "The KGCM-VAE integrates velocity modulation, MMD balancing of covariate distributions in latent space, and causal adjacency-constrained decoding.", "result": "Experimental evaluations show superior performance in PEHE and a 1.88% reduction in estimation error compared to benchmarks.", "conclusion": "KGCM-VAE offers a reliable method to understand causal mechanisms in polar climate systems, advancing global sea-level rise predictions."}}

Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models.

This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration.

We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization.

However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

These fixed-position approaches may fail to capture structural information beyond predefined sampling positions and can lead to artifacts or loss of detail.

However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the transformative role of AI in trademark law, focusing on its application and impact on trademark selection, search, and interpretation.", "motivation": "The motivation of the paper is to highlight the overlooked area of AI's role in shaping trademarks and its implications in economic decision-making, addressing the inefficiency in traditional consumer-focused trademark analysis.", "method": "The authors conducted empirical experiments to analyze the efficacy of trademark search engines, many of which use machine learning, and performed comparative analysis to evaluate their practical functionality.", "result": "The paper finds that AI-powered tools significantly impact the trademark ecosystem, transforming foundational doctrines and creating new efficiencies in trademark law and practice.", "conclusion": "AI demands a revised framework for understanding trademark law that integrates supply-side considerations, promoting innovation and efficiency in the application and interpretation of trademarks."}}

It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band.

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing.

Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents LungCRCT, a novel latent causal representation learning framework, enhancing lung cancer analysis, early detection, and enabling causal intervention simulations.", "motivation": "Lung cancer in its early stages is frequently silent and symptoms resemble other respiratory diseases, leading to missed opportunities for early detection which impacts survival rates.", "method": "The research introduces LungCRCT, leveraging advanced graph autoencoder-based causal discovery algorithms with distance correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement.", "result": "LungCRCT demonstrates both effective causal intervention analysis capabilities for lung cancer treatments and robust performance in malignant tumor classification, achieving an AUC score of 93.91%.", "conclusion": "The LungCRCT framework allows for significant enhancements in lung cancer treatment analysis and detection, supporting both practical application and future advancements in medical AI research."}}

The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions.

Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

This thesis investigates when and how language models form status hierarchies by adapting Berger et al.'s (1972) expectation states framework. I create multi-agent scenarios where separate language model instances complete sentiment classification tasks, are introduced with varying status characteristics (e.g., credentials, expertise), then have opportunities to revise their initial judgments after observing their partner's responses.

We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\u03a3_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector.

This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\u03a3_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\u03c0e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!).

By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a watermarking method using a grid-shaped pilot signal for synchronizing watermarks in images distorted by cropping and other geometric transformations.", "motivation": "The issue in current watermarking systems is their lack of robustness against image cropping, which disrupts synchronization, making it difficult to accurately extract the watermark.", "method": "The proposed method embeds a grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values.

We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access.

The research identifies gaps in Indian IP laws' adaptability to AI-generated outputs: trade secret protection is inadequate against AI threats; standardized inventorship criteria are absent. Employing doctrinal and comparative methodology, it scrutinizes legislative texts, judicial precedents and policy instruments across India, US, UK and EU. Preliminary findings reveal shortcomings: India's contract law creates fragmented trade secret regime; Section 3(k) of Indian Patents Act blocks AI invention patenting; copyright varies in authorship attribution. The study proposes harmonized legal taxonomy accommodating AI's role while preserving innovation incentives. India's National AI Strategy (2024) shows progress but legislative clarity is imperative.

We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents PrefixRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method for large language models that enhances learning efficiency by reusing off-policy traces, achieving faster and better results on hard reasoning problems.", "motivation": "The motivation is to improve efficiency and overcome learning stalls in RL for large language models, particularly on complex problems where on-policy traces are rare and policy gradients vanish.", "method": "PrefixRL reuses old compute in the form of off-policy traces, conditioning on prefixes of successful traces to stabilize optimization and modulate problem difficulty.", "result": "PrefixRL reaches the same reward twice as fast and achieves triple the final reward compared to baseline methods.

This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm.

Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them.

A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs.

That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data.

The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores conditions under which it is optimal to separate preference-free training from post-processing decisions, offering theoretical insights into modular AI pipelines in machine learning.", "motivation": "The motivation was to address under what conditions a preference-free training approach, followed by post-processing with preferences, is optimal across decision problems.", "method": "The authors analyze decision problems using information design methods and focus on embedding diminishing-value-of-information principles.", "result": "Applying preferences at the post-processing stage is shown to weakly dominate preference embedding during training for utility-based decisions, except when decision-stage barriers exist.", "conclusion": "Preference-free training is found to be generally superior for versatility and adaptability in decision-making, but preference embedding may be beneficial when cognitive constraints hinder optimal downstream decisions."}}

Traditional classification models struggle in this setting, as they assume a closed set of known categories and therefore fail to recognise or meaningfully group previously unseen Ragas. Recent works have tried categorizing unseen Ragas, but they run into a problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the knowledge of previously seen Ragas is diminished. To address this problem, we adopt a unified learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled audio, enabling the model to discover coherent categories corresponding to the unseen Ragas, while retaining the knowledge of previously known ones. We test our model on benchmark Raga Identification datasets and demonstrate its performance in categorizing previously seen, unseen, and all Raga classes.

While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.\n  We introduce $\u03b1^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $\u03b1^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $\u03b1^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).\n  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making.
