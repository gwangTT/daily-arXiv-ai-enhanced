This paper\npresents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin\nAmerica's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the\nselection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our\napproach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three\nfeature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and\ncontextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly\ncreated collections, we develop content-based representations using item\nembeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We\ntackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and\naddress visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases\nin production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through\nextensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our\nA/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase\nin overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,\nour offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,\nenabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this\nis the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food\ncollections in a dynamic commercial environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces RED, an automated food collection recommendation system for iFood, achieving significant improvements in user conversion rates via a LightGBM classifier and addressing cold-start and data scarcity issues.", "motivation": "To assist users in navigating extensive food catalogs on iFood and improve personalized food collection recommendations in a dynamic environment.", "method": "The approach uses LightGBM ensemble model trained on three types of features: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and contextual data.

The latter dynamically adapts to\nthe job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network\nbandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has\nin common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and\nto the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,\nusing OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level\noptimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML\ncontext. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running.
