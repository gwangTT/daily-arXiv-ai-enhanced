In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret\nlower bound of $\\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda\nscores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$.

Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a\npromising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of\nconformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce\nTorsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample\nconformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,\nusing only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular\ngraph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples\nrotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is\nable to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann\ndistribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for\nzero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD\nsimulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for\nscaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot\ngeneralization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local\nstructure into the GFlowNet model.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Torsional-GFN, a generative model for sampling molecular conformations proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution with promising results in scalability and generalization.", "motivation": "There is a need for stable molecular conformation generation in drug discovery to improve efficiency in sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, as existing methods like molecular dynamics can be computationally expensive.", "method": "The authors propose Torsional-GFN, a conditional generative flow network that uses a reward function to train and sample torsion angle rotations conditioned on a molecule's graph structure and local properties.", "result": "The model successfully samples conformations proportional to the Boltzmann distribution, works for multiple molecules with one model, and generalizes to unseen bond lengths and angles derived from molecular dynamics simulations.", "conclusion": "Torsional-GFN provides a scalable and effective approach to molecular conformation generation, with potential applications in larger systems and unseen molecules while incorporating local structure generation."}}
