Prior work suggests\ncalibration can improve alignment, but at-scale evidence is limited. In this\nwork, we investigate the feasibility of applying calibration of code models to\nan in-IDE context. We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical\nmethod for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of\ncode generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for\neffectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a\nscalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain\ncalibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate\nwhether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and\ndeveloper acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24\nmillion real-world developer interactions across multiple programming\nlanguages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on\nPlatt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence\nsignals.

Existing\nmethods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures\nor graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN\nlearning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs\noften suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain\nshifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal\nevolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time\nperiods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's\nrobustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical\nobservations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test\ngraph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it\nin heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance\nof pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training\nor update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural\ntransformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.\nSpecifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,\nfacilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the\nconfidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine\nbenchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate\nthat GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements of up to 10.92%.

Cross-model testing showed varying success rates: 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% ASR on Llama-3, and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash. Cybersecurity contexts (93% ASR) were most vulnerable, while categories involving physical harm showed more resistance (55.6% ASR).", "conclusion": "The study demonstrates the systematic vulnerabilities of current LLM safety mechanisms and underscores the need for robust defenses in AI-driven cybersecurity applications to mitigate susceptibility to adversarial prompt engineering attacks."}}
