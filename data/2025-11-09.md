### [1] [Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773)
*Zhaorun Chen,Zhuokai Zhao,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Qi Qi,Yifan Wu,Tarun Kalluri,Sara Cao,Yuanhao Xiong,Haibo Tong,Huaxiu Yao,Hengduo Li,Jiacheng Zhu,Xian Li,Dawn Song,Bo Li,Jason Weston,Dat Huynh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DreamGym, a framework to address scalability challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) by synthesizing diverse and scalable experiences for effective online RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning faces practical challenges including costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity, which hinder scalable experience data collection.

Method: DreamGym uses reasoning-based experience modeling for state transitions and feedback signals, employs an experience replay buffer with offline real-world data, and generates adaptive tasks for curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym improved RL training across synthetic and real-world applications. It achieved over 30% better performance in non-RL scenarios like WebArena and matched state-of-the-art RL algorithms in costly settings using only synthetic interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym provides a scalable framework for RL by enabling effective training through synthetic experiences, improving outcomes even in real-environment RL setups with fewer real-world interactions.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [2] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates how tokenization strategies affect assembly code analysis, particularly in downstream tasks like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in assembly code analysis is an underexplored area, despite its importance in influencing vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic task performance.

Method: The paper evaluates various tokenization models and parameter choices through intrinsic metrics and downstream performance analysis. It also uses pre-trained models like Llama 3.2, BERT, and BART to assess tokenizer effectiveness.

Result: The study finds that the choice of tokenizer significantly impacts downstream performance, and intrinsic metrics offer partial predictability for extrinsic outcomes, showing trade-offs between tokenizer properties and practical utility.

Conclusion: Key insights into optimizing tokenization for low-level code analysis are provided, enhancing the robustness and scalability of NLP-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

### [3] [To See or To Read: User Behavior Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03845)
*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BehaviorLens, a benchmarking framework to evaluate how user-behavior data representation (text vs. images) affects performance in six multimodal large language models (MLLMs), showing that image representations significantly improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether textual or image representations of user-behavior data result in better reasoning and prediction performance in multimodal language models.

Method: The authors developed BehaviorLens, which benchmarks MLLM performance by representing user-behavior data in three formats: text paragraphs, scatter plots, and flowcharts, and then measured performance on predicting user behavior using a real-world purchase-sequence dataset.

Result: The study found that representing user behavior data as images enhanced MLLMs' next-purchase prediction accuracy by 87.5% compared to textual representations, without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: Image representations of user-behavior data are significantly more effective than textual ones for improving the reasoning and prediction capabilities of MLLMs, and BehaviorLens facilitates systematic benchmarking of such trade-offs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [4] [KnowThyself: An Agentic Assistant for LLM Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03878)
*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KnowThyself, a chat-based tool for improving large language model (LLM) interpretability by consolidating functionalities and offering interactive visual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented and code-intensive nature of existing LLM interpretability tools, making them more accessible and user-friendly.

Method: KnowThyself uses an orchestrator LLM to reformulate queries, an agent router to direct them to specific modules, and outputs are transformed into guided visual explanations within a conversational workflow.

Result: KnowThyself lowers technical barriers, consolidates fragmented functionalities, and provides an extensible platform for inspecting LLMs with interactive visualizations.

Conclusion: The tool simplifies the process of LLM interpretability and creates a solid foundation for accessible and user-friendly model inspection processes.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [5] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), highlighting its ability to model causal relationships between knowledge components (KCs). This ability explains DKT's predictive success, contradicting the prior belief that its strength lies in modeling bidirectional relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify the mechanisms behind DKT's performance in educational research and to address misconceptions about its primary strength in knowledge tracing.

Method: Researchers use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to prune exercise relation graphs and train DKT on causal subsets from the Assistments dataset. They also introduce a method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's representations.

Result: It was found that DKT's predictive success aligns strongly with causal structures, not merely with bidirectional relationships between KCs.

Conclusion: DKT's effectiveness largely stems from approximating causal dependencies between KCs, which has implications for understanding and designing KT models.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [6] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study delves into cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing that while responses can shift with prompts and cultural perspectives, LLMs remain consistently biased towards a limited set of countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate whether LLMs effectively represent cultural diversity given their training data biases and optimization objectives, as they are increasingly used globally.

Method: The authors tested 10 LLMs using 63 items from established cultural value surveys, translating them into 11 languages and posing them with variations in prompt formulations and explicit cultural perspectives.

Result: The research shows that LLM outputs vary by prompt language and cultural perspective but align predominantly with values from a limited group of countries. Explicit cultural framing improved alignment with human values, but the effect was limited.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit minimal responsiveness to cultural diversity despite prompt variations, suggesting entrenched biases towards specific countries' values and a challenge in achieving broader cultural representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [7] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot is a multi-agent system that optimizes ML architecture generation and evaluation with minimal computational resources, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents in ML engineering have strong capabilities but require full training runs for evaluation, which increases computational overhead and limits scalability.

Method: ArchPilot integrates three specialized agents: orchestration (using a novel MCTS-inspired algorithm), generation (for architecture design), and evaluation (utilizing proxy training to assess candidate models).

Result: Experiments show ArchPilot outperforms state-of-the-art methods like AIDE and ML-Master on MLE-Bench, showcasing improved efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: ArchPilot offers a scalable and computation-efficient framework for automated ML engineering, reducing reliance on expensive training runs while maintaining high effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

### [8] [Detecting Silent Failures in Multi-Agentic AI Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04032)
*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting failures (anomalies) in Multi-Agentic AI systems, such as drifts and cycles, by curating datasets and benchmarking anomaly detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to handle non-deterministic and failure-prone behavior in Multi-Agentic AI systems, which can lead to operational inefficiencies and undetectable issues.

Method: A dataset curation pipeline is developed to capture user behavior, agent non-determinism, and variation in LLMs. Two benchmark datasets are created and labeled using this pipeline, with supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) methods tested.

Result: Two benchmark datasets with 4,275 and 894 trajectories were created. Benchmarking showed that supervised methods achieved up to 98% accuracy, while semi-supervised methods achieved up to 96% accuracy in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the systematic analysis of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, providing valuable datasets, benchmarks, and actionable insights for future advancements in this area.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

### [9] [Interpreting Multi-Attribute Confounding through Numerical Attributes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04053)
*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates numerical reasoning errors in large language models (LLMs), exploring how numerical attributes are encoded and affected by context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the representational mechanisms behind LLMs' numerical reasoning errors, aiming to uncover vulnerabilities and improve decision-making.

Method: Employed linear probing, partial correlation analysis, and prompt-based tests across LLMs of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode numerical correlations but amplify them systematically. Irrelevant context causes shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects varying by model size.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit vulnerabilities in numerical reasoning due to amplified correlations and context interference, highlighting the need for improved control over multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [10] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a negotiation-based redistricting framework using game theory and large language models, aiming to minimize partisan bias and enhance fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The redistricting process often allows partisan actors to exploit formal constraints while selecting politically advantageous maps, leading to unfairness.

Method: The paper introduces 'Agentmandering,' a turn-based negotiation framework using large language model agents, where political interests alternate in selecting and freezing districts from candidate maps.

Result: Agentmandering reduces partisan bias and unfairness significantly, demonstrating stability and minimal variance in outcomes when tested on post-2020 U.S. Census data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework embeds strategic considerations into redistricting, resulting in fairer and more stable districting plans, particularly beneficial for politically sensitive regions like swing states.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

### [11] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative framework using large language models (LLMs) with a structured retriever (KGFR) for efficient zero-shot reasoning on knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at reasoning but face challenges with knowledge-intensive queries due to limited scalability and parametrized knowledge, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The method integrates an LLM with the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR), which employs LLM-generated descriptions and asymmetrical progressive propagation for scalable and generalizable reasoning.

Result: LLM-KGFR demonstrates strong performance in reasoning while efficiently handling large graphs, showing scalability and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR offers a practical solution for reasoning with knowledge graphs, effectively addressing scalability and dataset-specific tuning issues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

### [12] [Testing the Testers: Human-Driven Quality Assessment of Voice AI Testing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04133)
*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing quality using human-centered benchmarking and statistical methods, validated through comprehensive comparisons of commercial platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement and production deployment of voice AI agents necessitate reliable testing methodologies. Currently, organizations lack systematic tools to objectively assess the reliability of their testing platforms, creating a significant gap in quality assurance as voice AI interactions scale massively.

Method: The authors developed a framework that uses human-centered benchmarking to address testing challenges. It combines psychometric techniques such as Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, and permutation tests with statistical validation to measure simulation and evaluation quality of testing platforms.

Result: The framework was validated through empirical analysis using 21,600 human judgments over 45 test simulations and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. It found significant performance differences among platforms, with the leading platform, Evalion, achieving higher metrics for evaluation quality (f1-score of 0.92) and simulation quality (league score of 0.61) compared to competitors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust, reproducible, and statistically valid method to evaluate voice AI testing platforms. It equips organizations with essential tools for assessing testing quality and supports large-scale, confident deployment of voice AI technologies. Supporting materials are available for adoption and reproducibility.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [13] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges of using empowerment as a goal-agnostic motivation for AI agents in multi-human environments, presenting a potential misalignment issue in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the efficacy and limitations of empowerment as a universal, goal-agnostic objective for AI agents in multi-human environments such as homes and hospitals.

Method: The authors introduce Disempower-Grid, a multi-human gridworld test suite, to study how empowering one human can disempower another. They also evaluated the use of joint empowerment strategies to address this issue.

Result: Findings show that AI agents optimizing an individual’s empowerment can reduce others' influence and rewards, i.e., lead to disempowerment. Joint empowerment can mitigate this but at the expense of individual rewards.

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives like empowerment, which appear well-aligned in single-agent scenarios, can lead to conflicts and disempowerment in multi-agent settings, posing challenges for AI alignment in such contexts.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a probabilistic model to assess and optimize workflow performance and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive framework that quantifies workflow quality and efficiency while combining correctness, reliability, cost, and optimization.

Method: The framework integrates Opus Workflow Reward, estimating expected performance, and Opus Workflow Normative Penalties that assess structural and informational quality. Reinforcement Learning loops are used for workflow discovery and refinement.

Result: The paper provides probabilistic models, measurable penalties, and an optimization formulation to enhance workflow assessment and selection.

Conclusion: The framework serves for automated assessment and optimization, enabling improved workflow quality and efficiency through quantifiable metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-agent coordination under limited bandwidth by introducing a predictive coding framework that minimizes mutual uncertainty. It demonstrates high resilience in a Memory-Maze benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of partial observability and constrained bandwidth in multi-agent systems that often cause failures in coordination.

Method: A predictive coding approach based on minimizing mutual uncertainty. This involves self-localized spatial coding, development of efficient communication mechanisms, and hierarchical reinforcement learning policies.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates robust performance under bandwidth constraints, outperforming traditional approaches with success rates degrading gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a biologically plausible basis for efficient social representation and collective intelligence by leveraging self-supervised and predictive coordination mechanisms.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses RLVR overfitting issues and introduces RLoop, an iterative framework improving generalization and solving catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting and generalization issues in reinforcement learning for verifiable rewards (RLVR), caused by policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The study introduces RLoop, a framework combining iterative policy initialization and rejection-sampling fine-tuning (RFT). This approach refines policies through a cycle of exploration and exploitation, creating an expert dataset to build improved initial policies iteratively.

Result: RLoop mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances generalization in RLVR tasks, achieving a 9% improvement in average accuracy and a 15%+ increase in pass@32 compared to standard RL.

Conclusion: The iterative RLoop framework significantly improves reinforcement learning outcomes by transforming transient variations into sustained performance gains, addressing the core issue of RL overfitting.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

TL;DR: Introduced GUI-360°, a dataset for advancing computer-using agents (CUAs) with 1.2M action steps, addressing key gaps in GUI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent gaps in computer-using agent research including scarce real-world CUA tasks, absence of automated annotation pipelines, and lack of unified benchmarks.

Method: Developed an LLM-augmented and automated pipeline for dataset generation and task benchmarking, covering GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.

Result: Provided over 1.2M action steps in GUI environments, showcasing current shortcomings in vision-language models but improvement through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: GUI-360° aids research in CUAs by offering a comprehensive dataset and benchmarks, enabling advancements towards robust desktop agents.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the reliability of probe accuracy in Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and proposes alignment-based evaluation metrics to ensure concepts are properly captured.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of using probe accuracy as an indicator of concept alignment in Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), and solve the problem of spurious correlations in current methods.

Method: Introduces a novel concept localization method using spatial linear attribution and evaluates it against feature visualization methods. Proposes three metrics for assessing concept alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

Result: The paper demonstrates that standard probes often capture spurious correlations rather than the intended concept. They find that alignment-focused probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment enhance concept alignment.

Conclusion: Accuracy alone isn't sufficient to assess concept alignment. New evaluation metrics and tailored probe designs are essential for improving concept interpretability and reliability in explainable AI.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdversariaLLM, a toolbox aimed at streamlining and standardizing research on Large Language Model robustness and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research ecosystem for Large Language Model safety is fragmented and buggy, posing challenges for reproducibility and comparability.

Method: AdversariaLLM was designed with features for reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. It incorporates adversarial attack algorithms, benchmark datasets, and integrates access to open-weight LLMs.

Result: The framework supports reproducible and comparable research with advanced functionalities like compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM provides a strong foundation aiming to unify and improve research transparency and comparability in the field of LLM safety and robustness.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework is proposed to simulate clinical consultations and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for medication safety, resulting in a new benchmark, RxSafeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on medication safety of LLMs due to lack of realistic datasets and privacy concerns, along with the underexploration of these AI models in clinical consultation settings.

Method: Generated diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks, developed RxRisk DB containing contraindications, drug interactions, and indication-drug pairs, and created RxSafeBench scenarios for simulation-based evaluation.

Result: LLMs struggle to address medication safety, particularly integrating implicit contraindication and interaction knowledge. Issues with reliability emerge.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench serves as a benchmark for assessing how well LLMs manage medication safety, aiming to improve AI-driven clinical decision support.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

### [21] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework to improve test-time reasoning by incorporating metacognitive monitoring into existing Generate-Verify architectures, addressing issues like prefix dominance trap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prefix dominance trap in reasoning systems, where models commit to suboptimal reasoning paths early and struggle to recover, resulting in significant accuracy losses.

Method: The method involves formalizing metacognitive theories (Flavell's and Nelson and Narens') into computational specifications and creating the MGV framework that incorporates monitoring prior to generation and refines it through verification feedback.

Result: The paper does not present empirical validation but provides theoretical advancements by introducing a systematic computational translation of metacognitive theories and highlighting reasoning system failures.

Conclusion: This work offers a principled approach for understanding reasoning failures and proposes actionable architectural modifications via the MGV framework for future reasoning designs.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [22] [Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04393)
*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a method to improve large language models' (LLMs) decision-making abilities by training them on low-regret decision trajectories iteratively, without heavy reliance on predefined templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making in dynamic environments, they struggle to achieve effective exploration and low regret due to limitations in their original designs.

Method: A post-training procedure called Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (RMFT) is developed where LLMs repeatedly generate decision trajectories, select low-regret examples, and fine-tune themselves on those examples. This method eliminates rigid structures by using model-generated reasoning based on regret metrics.

Result: Iterative RMFT improves decision-making performance in diverse LLM setups, from numerical-transformer-based models to both open-weight and advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini, ensuring effective generalization across varying tasks and contexts.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT provides a flexible and theoretically grounded framework to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models, leveraging natural-effectiveness and adaptability across tasks and environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [23] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoRPO, an improvement to Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reinforcement learning training of LLMs by introducing an adaptive baseline to avoid reinforcing incorrect behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was the need to refine GRPO for reinforcement learning in LLMs, as its simplicity caused issues when using richer feedback like ordinal rewards.

Method: CoRPO introduces an adaptive baseline that ensures failed solutions are never positively reinforced and shifts to relative preference mode once a minimum quality threshold is consistently met.

Result: CoRPO showed more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization on a code verification task when compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: CoRPO represents a significant advancement for enabling LLMs to learn new, complex capabilities using richer multi-dimensional feedback, progressing reinforcement learning systems beyond binary constraints.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAVe, a hybrid system combining classical pathfinding algorithms with a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized vehicle routing with contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing systems effectively optimize for singular metrics but fail to consider complex, context-based factors like multi-step tasks or situational constraints faced by human drivers.

Method: PAVe integrates a multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm (time, CO2) with an LLM agent that evaluates route options based on user-provided tasks, preferences, and rules using a geospatial cache.

Result: PAVe achieved over 88% accuracy in initial route selection when applied to realistic urban scenarios with a local model.

Conclusion: Combining classical routing algorithms with semantic reasoning through an LLM can provide personalized, adaptive, and scalable solutions for urban mobility challenges.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the energy and environmental impact of web agents like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, highlighting discrepancies in energy use and emphasizing the need for transparency and energy-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the sustainability concerns associated with the growing development and deployment of web agents, which remain largely unexplored despite the increasing reliance on these technologies.

Method: The authors approach the issue by conducting both theoretical estimations and empirical benchmarking to evaluate the energy and CO2 costs of web agents.

Result: The study reveals that different design philosophies significantly affect energy consumption, proving that higher energy use does not guarantee better performance. It also identifies a lack of transparency in disclosing model parameters and processes.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a paradigm shift in evaluating web agents, proposing the inclusion of dedicated metrics for energy consumption in benchmarks to drive sustainable development.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

*Andrea Cera Palatsi,Samuel Martin-Gutierrez,Ana S. Cardenal,Max Pellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines large language models' ability to replicate human decision-making by creating a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and finds that some models simulate human behavior effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how closely LLMs mirror human decision-making is essential to avoid harmful outcomes in practical applications and improve their use in social simulations.

Method: The authors developed a digital twin for game-theoretic experiments and used a systematic prompting and probing framework to evaluate three open-source models (Llama, Mistral, and Qwen).

Result: Llama was found to replicate human cooperation behavior accurately, while Qwen closely aligned with Nash equilibrium predictions. Population-level behavioral replication was achieved without persona-based prompting.

Conclusion: Properly calibrated LLMs can replicate human behavioral patterns and generate testable hypotheses, providing a new approach to experiments in social and behavioral sciences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [27] [Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04556)
*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces a data-driven sparse sensing framework integrated with the EPA-SWMM model to optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in urban stormwater systems, achieving robust and accurate results with minimal sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding, caused by intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems, is increasing in frequency. Predicting and monitoring floods at high resolution is desired but constrained by resources like time, budget, and technology. There is a need for effective monitoring and predictive capabilities for urban drainage networks under limited resources.

Method: The study uses a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework integrated with the EPA-SWMM model for sensor placement optimization. Dimensionality reduction is applied via singular value decomposition, and sensor allocation is performed using QR factorization. The approach leverages simulated data from a SWMM model and validates sensor placements by reconstructing peak flowrate profiles.

Result: Three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved high reconstruction accuracy, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values ranging between 0.92 and 0.95. The framework demonstrated robustness to measurement uncertainties and sensor failures, improving performance with more deployed sensors.

Conclusion: The DSS framework effectively balances computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling accurate flow reconstruction in urban stormwater systems with minimal sensors. It can be applied for flood early warning and real-time control in scenarios with limited resources.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents Jr. AI Scientist, an autonomous AI for scientific research, which follows a structured research workflow and delivers higher-quality papers compared to existing AI systems, while identifying significant limitations and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress, while maintaining the integrity of the academic ecosystem.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [29] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to handle ambiguities in natural language queries to tabular data by reframing them as opportunities for cooperative interaction between the user and the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in queries to tabular data have traditionally been seen as deficiencies, but the paper aims to reframe them as opportunities for cooperative user-system interaction.

Method: The authors developed a framework to classify queries into cooperative (resolvable) and uncooperative (unresolvable) types, analyzing query types across 15 popular datasets.

Result: They observe that existing evaluations mix query types without controlling for cooperation, leading to inadequate assessments of execution and interpretation capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of cooperation in query resolution and provides insights for improving design and evaluation of tabular natural language interfaces, with suggestions for future research directions.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an auditing framework to measure representation in deliberative processes, using the concept of justified representation (JR), and introduces efficient auditing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of selecting representative questions for expert panels in deliberative processes amidst constraints such as limited time.

Method: Introduced JR-based auditing framework and algorithms. Investigated both historical deliberations and alternatives using integer linear programming and large language models (LLMs) to assess representation efficacy.

Result: Developed efficient algorithms for JR auditing and compared actual historical practices to LLM-generated and optimized question sets.

Conclusion: The findings show potential for LLMs in improving deliberative processes, while also highlighting their current limitations. The provided tools aim to enhance representation in future deliberations globally.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents DR. WELL, a decentralized framework for multi-agent planning that employs symbolic reasoning to enable flexible and scalable cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cooperative multi-agent planning by enabling better synchronization and efficient collaboration under constraints of partial information and limited communication.

Method: DR. WELL functions through a two-phase negotiation where agents propose roles and reach consensus, followed by executing symbolic plans grounded in outcomes using a shared dynamic world model.

Result: The framework demonstrated adaptation and improved task completion rates and efficiency in cooperative block-push tasks, highlighting the benefits of reusable symbolic plans and dynamic world modeling.

Conclusion: DR. WELL improves multi-agent planning by avoiding brittle alignment issues, leveraging symbolic reasoning, and adopting scalable strategies that enhance collaboration efficiency over time.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

### [32] [VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662)
*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with verifying their own multi-step reasoning logic. VeriCoT introduces a method to formalize and verify reasoning steps using first-order logic and symbolic representation, improving reasoning validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of LLMs in reliably verifying their reasoning logic, even when achieving correct answers, pose risks in critical applications.

Method: VeriCoT extracts formal logical arguments from LLM reasoning using first-order logic, employs automated solvers for logical validity verification, and leverages symbolic representations for identifying ungrounded reasoning.

Result: Experiments with various datasets demonstrate VeriCoT's effectiveness in detecting flawed reasoning and improving answer correctness.

Conclusion: VeriCoT enhances LLM reasoning by introducing rigorous verification processes, leading to improved accuracy and trustworthiness in multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

*Tong Zhang,Vikram Sharma Mailthody,Fei Sun,Linsen Ma,Chris J. Newburn,Teresa Zhang,Yang Liu,Jiangpeng Li,Hao Zhong,Wen-Mei Hwu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper revisits the five-minute rule for data storage decisions, integrating modern considerations like DRAM and SSD costs, and demonstrates its relevance for modern AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to update and refine the five-minute rule to reflect advancements in storage and computational technologies for today's AI platforms.

Method: The researchers developed a constraint and workload-aware framework, incorporating host costs, DRAM bandwidth, SSD performance models, and introduced MQSim-Next for validation and simulation.

Result: The shift in caching thresholds from minutes to seconds redefines NAND flash memory as an active data tier, opening new hardware-software research opportunities.

Conclusion: The work transforms a heuristic into a practical, awareness-driven framework for memory provisioning, facilitating better optimization for AI-era systems.

Abstract: In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a
simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should
live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely
retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and
workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first
principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and
physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these
elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable
provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially
GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained
random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a
few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and
exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further
introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and
sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.
Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system
design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a
classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and
provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory
hierarchy.

*Yuanpeng Zhang,Xing Hu,Xi Chen,Zhihang Yuan,Cong Li,Jingchen Zhu,Zhao Wang,Chenguang Zhang,Xin Si,Wei Gao,Qiang Wu,Runsheng Wang,Guangyu Sun*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIM, a software and hardware co-design framework to mitigate IR-drop in high-performance PIM architectures, achieving improved energy efficiency and computational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IR-drop issues in high-performance SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) systems degrade chip performance and reliability, necessitating effective mitigation strategies beyond traditional circuit-level methods.

Method: The paper proposes architecture-level IR-drop mitigation techniques, including new mechanisms (Rtog and HR), software optimization strategies (LHR and WDS), a dynamic adjustment mechanism (IR-Booster), and a task mapping method considering software and hardware interactions.

Result: Post-layout simulations show up to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement and 1.152x computational speedup on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip.

Conclusion: AIM effectively addresses IR-drop challenges in SRAM PIM by combining architecture-level innovations and co-design strategies, achieving significant improvements in energy efficiency, computational performance, and reliability.

Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising
implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,
energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher
performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating
frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly
degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional
circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are
resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To
address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware
co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.
Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties
of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between
PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,
enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while
maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,
we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates
software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt
the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and
performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging
software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout
simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up
to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement
and 1.152x speedup.

Conclusion: Addressing communication bottlenecks is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of heterogeneous systems and advancing modern computing infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data-intensive applications such as generative AI,
scientific simulations, and large-scale analytics is driving modern
supercomputers and data centers toward increasingly heterogeneous and tightly
integrated architectures. These systems combine powerful CPUs and accelerators
with emerging high-bandwidth memory and storage technologies to reduce data

*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates leveraging the Big Five Personality Traits to control Large Language Models' behaviors, employing a novel pipeline for personality alignment and behavioral steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliably controlling personalities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific needs by bridging psychological theory with practical model alignment.

Method: The pipeline extracts hidden state activations from Transformer layers using the Big Five Personality Traits, applies low-rank subspace discovery methods, identifies optimal layers for injecting personality traits, and operationalizes these traits through a steering framework.

Result: The study demonstrates that personality traits reside in a low-rank shared subspace and these structures can be transformed into actionable mechanisms for behavior control without degrading model performance.

Conclusion: The paper presents a mechanism for aligning LLM behavior with personality traits effectively, paving the way for enhanced controllability in language models while preserving their core performance attributes.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextualVerifier, a self-verification framework for the TextGrad optimization system, utilizing large language models for verification and reporting improved reliability and performance in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of self-verification mechanisms in TextGrad, aiming to ensure reasoning validity in text-driven decision making through chain-of-thought reasoning and majority voting.

Method: TextualVerifier employs a four-stage workflow comprising chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation, integrating non-invasively into TextGrad systems.

Result: Experimental results show marked improvements in reasoning validity (29%) and optimization performance (up to 10.71 percentage points across different benchmarks), with moderate computational overhead.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier successfully enhances the reliability of TextGrad by introducing the first-ever self-verification framework for text-based optimization, paving the way for more robust AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PLLuM fills the gap for Polish language AI tools, promotes open research, and enhances sovereign AI technologies in Poland through its public release.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

### [42] [STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03827)
*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces STARS, a decoding-time algorithm for aligning large language models (LLMs) more efficiently and effectively by iterating token segment-level sampling and scoring to improve quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning large language models, like fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling, are computationally expensive or infeasible. There’s a need for a more efficient and scalable approach to improve alignment with human values.

Method: The paper proposes STARS, a decoding-time algorithm that improves alignment by sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments iteratively, allowing early adjustments in the generation process.

Result: STARS outperformed fine-tuning methods by up to 14.9% and optimization methods by up to 4.3% in win rates across six large language models, while remaining competitive with Best-of-N baselines.

Conclusion: STARS demonstrates that granular, reward-guided sampling during decoding is a robust, general, and efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning and sequence-ranking methods for improving LLM alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

*Mikołaj Langner,Jan Eliasz,Ewa Rudnicka,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient method for multi-label text classification using large language models by breaking tasks into yes/no queries, enhancing efficiency, and preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address efficiency challenges in multi-label text classification using LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The method involves reformulating classification tasks into independent yes/no queries combined with prefix caching. LLM outputs are distilled and aggregated to fine-tune smaller models.

Result: Fine-tuned models show significant improvement over zero-shot baselines, particularly for dimensions encountered during training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and scalable for multi-label classification tasks, validated on affective text analysis but broadly applicable across domains.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates machine translation datasets for low-resourced languages (Afan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya), revealing quality issues like gender biases and harmful depictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight risks of focusing on dataset quantity over quality in low-resourced language NLP research and examine gender representation and harmful content in machine translation datasets.

Method: Analyzed datasets for three low-resourced languages across domains and conducted a detailed examination of gender bias and harmful content.

Result: Datasets are heavily skewed towards certain domains, show a strong male gender bias, and contain harmful/toxic content, particularly in larger datasets.

Conclusion: Quantity of data does not guarantee quality; the findings emphasize the need for careful dataset review and mitigation of biases for low-resourced languages.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hallucination mitigation for large language models using Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), showing improved accuracy, reduced hallucination, and increased factual correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation techniques for LLMs often rely on external knowledge sources but face challenges in fragility and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed GRAD method grounds generation in corpus-derived evidence during decoding by constructing sparse token transition graphs and adaptively fusing graph-retrieved logits with model logits.

Result: GRAD outperforms baselines in question-answering tasks, achieving up to 9.7% higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6% lower hallucination rates, and 6.9% greater correctness.

Conclusion: GRAD serves as a lightweight alternative for improving large language models, effectively steering outputs toward more truthful and verifiable information without relying on heavy external integration or retraining.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the performance of humans and vision-language models in iterated reference games, highlighting models' difficulties in context-sensitive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the pragmatic reasoning abilities of humans and vision-language models in language-based tasks using multi-turn linguistic environments.

Method: Testing humans and vision-language models on iterated reference game trials with variations in the context (e.g., amount, order, and relevance) to observe their abilities under different conditions.

Result: Without relevant context, models performed worse than humans but showed improvement with relevant context over multiple trials. Machine learning models still struggled with abstract referents.

Conclusion: Vision-language models significantly improve with relevant context but lag behind human performance, especially in handling abstract referents in reference games.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI) that uses U.S. social media data to measure human flourishing indicators such as happiness, health, purpose, and relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability to measure societal well-being beyond economic metrics, addressing the limitation of existing measures with low spatial and temporal resolution.

Method: Utilization of fine-tuned large language models to analyze 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023), classifying data into 48 indicators related to human flourishing. These indicators were validated against established metrics.

Result: The study provides monthly and yearly county- and state-level data for flourishing-related discourse. It demonstrates the accuracy and correlations of the measures with other established indicators.

Conclusion: The HFGI enables a comprehensive analysis of societal well-being and offers novel insights into inequality and social change, leveraging extensive and validated social media data for high-resolution monitoring of human flourishing.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

### [48] [Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models via Vector Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03945)
*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for enabling direct exchange of semantic representations between large language models (LLMs) for efficient communication in collaborative AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and computational overhead caused when large language models rely solely on token-based communication, discarding latent semantics in multi-agent settings.

Method: The authors propose a latent bridge for cross-model communication using vector translations, facilitated by a dual-encoder translator trained on Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. These vector translations allow semantic exchange between representation spaces.

Result: The proposed method achieved an average cosine alignment of 0.538, with blending strength adjustments enabling controlled steering of generation without destabilizing logits. Analysis revealed a transfer asymmetry between general-purpose and instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: Cross-model latent communication is feasible using the presented method, paving the way for collaborative AI systems that exchange semantic meanings efficiently instead of plaintext tokens.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating abductive inference into retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) to address reasoning gaps caused by incomplete evidence, improving accuracy and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, which struggle with reasoning gaps when retrieved evidence is incomplete.

Method: Integrates abductive inference into RAG systems by detecting insufficient evidence, generating missing premises, and validating them through consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Experimental results show improvement in answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Abductive inference is a promising method to enhance the robustness and explainability of RAG systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST) for automatic speech recognition tasks, offering robust performance even with high transcription error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the adaptability of Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) to handle errors in transcripts without relying on extensive, high-quality annotated data.

Method: Developed WST, which involves a flexible training graph to handle transcription errors robustly without extra confidence estimation or pre-trained models.

Result: Empirical evaluations showed WST maintains strong performance under transcription error rates up to 70% and surpasses existing CTC-based approaches like BTC and OTC.

Conclusion: WST demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in realistic speech recognition scenarios; implementation will be publicly accessible.

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-FIX, a benchmark to evaluate LLM explanations based on expert alignment in knowledge-intensive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM explanations, focused on plausibility or internal faithfulness, fail to assess alignment with expert reasoning.

Method: The authors collaborated with domain experts to create T-FIX, a benchmark across seven domains, and developed specialized metrics to measure LLM explanations' alignment with expert judgment.

Result: T-FIX provides a structured approach to evaluate the quality of LLM explanations in terms of alignment with expert intuition.

Conclusion: Expert alignment is critical for deploying LLMs in professional domains; T-FIX addresses this gap with its robust benchmarking framework.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

*Xinying Qian,Ying Zhang,Yu Zhao,Baohang Zhou,Xuhui Sui,Xiaojie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a framework called PoK to improve Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) by combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, achieving superior results over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues with previous temporal knowledge reasoning methods, including limited semantic understanding of time constraints and shortcomings in Large Language Models' (LLMs) temporal reasoning abilities.

Method: The PoK framework involves two components: 1) The Plan of Knowledge module, which decomposes complex temporal questions into a sequence of sub-objectives for intermediate reasoning guidance, and 2) a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework for selecting temporally aligned facts.

Result: PoK improves both retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy on temporal knowledge tasks. It outperformed state-of-the-art TKGQA methods, achieving up to 56.0% performance gains.

Conclusion: PoK successfully enhances interpretability and factual consistency in temporal reasoning tasks by integrating structured planning and temporal knowledge retrieval into LLMs.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) differ from humans in forming word associations, particularly focusing on emotionally charged words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs form emotional and creative word associations in a manner similar to human cognitive processes.

Method: The researchers compared human word associations with those generated by large language models, analyzing responses to emotionally charged word cues.

Result: Findings show moderate overlap between human and LLM associations, with LLMs amplifying emotional elements but being more predictable and less creative.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit different associative behaviors from humans, particularly in the areas of creativity and emotional engagement.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel transformer-based model for automated de-identification of radiology reports, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for improved automated de-identification systems for radiology reports by leveraging large, diverse training datasets and transformer-based models to ensure robust PHI detection.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned a transformer-based de-identification pipeline using large annotated radiology corpora, introduced a new PHI category (AGE), and evaluated its performance on diverse testing datasets while benchmarking against commercial systems.

Result: The model achieved high F1 scores (0.973 on Penn, 0.996 on Stanford datasets) and surpassed commercial cloud vendor systems on synthetic datasets (F1 score: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754). Synthetic PHI generation also showed stable detectability.

Conclusion: The advanced transformer-based model improves generalization, robustness, and privacy in clinical text processing, outperforming prior state-of-the-art solutions and commercial counterparts.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [55] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits the problem of language identification in the limit under a new setting that allows learners to make a limited number of guesses ($k$-list). It provides a clear characterization for when $k$-list identification is possible and explores its implications in statistical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the classic challenge of language identification in the limit being deemed impossible for most language collections by earlier work (Gold, Angluin). With recent advancements in related fields like language generation, the authors seek to revisit this problem by introducing $k$-list outputs to expand the reach of language identification.

Method: The authors extend Angluin's foundational work by exploring a recursive characterization for $k$-list identification. They establish that a language collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit if it can be decomposed into $k$ sub-collections that are individually identifiable in the limit.

Result: The paper demonstrates that for $k$-list identifiable collections, the identification process can occur at an exponential rate, which is the best achievable rate. For collections that cannot be $k$-list identified, no meaningful identification rate is obtainable.

Conclusion: This work extends the classic understanding of language identification in the limit, showing how $k$-list identification broadens the feasibility of solving this problem while providing both theoretical characterizations and implications in statistical settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

### [56] [Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking Reasoning Under Constraint: How Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04108)
*Wenmo Qiu,Saurabh Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Batching in large language models improves efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making in multi-step reasoning tasks by suppressing overthinking and creating collective effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the benefits of batch prompting in Large Reasoning Models beyond throughput optimization.

Method: The study employs batch prompting across 13 diverse benchmarks, analyzing its impact on model behavior, accuracy, and token usage.

Result: Batching improved reasoning accuracy, reduced token use (often by 3x-5x), suppressed overthinking, and facilitated collective learning effects within batches.

Conclusion: Batch prompting is effective not only for cost optimization but also as a regularizer that enhances reasoning efficiency and reliability in large language models.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

*Xinyuan Li,Murong Xu,Wenbiao Tao,Hanlun Zhu,Yike Zhao,Jipeng Zhang,Yunshi Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RIDE, an adversarial question-rewriting framework that utilizes Item Response Theory (IRT) to evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) by systematically generating challenging variations of math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential biases in LLM mathematical reasoning such as data leakage and superficial pattern matching, and to enable systematic evaluation of question difficulty and benchmarks.

Method: The authors use Item Response Theory to rank question difficulty based on LLM responses, apply reinforcement learning with a difficulty ranker, and create perturbed variations of questions at different difficulty levels.

Result: RIDE produces adversarial mathematical problems that lead to a 21.73% average drop in performance across 26 LLMs, highlighting deficiencies in mathematical reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed RIDE framework effectively measures true reasoning abilities and exposes the limitations in LLMs’ mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the validity of this innovative evaluation approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

### [58] [CantoASR: Prosody-Aware ASR-LALM Collaboration for Low-Resource Cantonese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04139)
*Dazhong Chen,Yi-Cheng Lin,Yuchen Huang,Ziwei Gong,Di Jiang,Zeying Xie,Yi R.,Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CantoASR, a framework combining ASR and large audio-language models to improve Cantonese speech recognition, addressing issues like limited data, tonal complexity, and accent variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cantonese ASR faces challenges due to limited annotated data, tonal complexity, and accent variations, leading to high word error rates in current models like Whisper.

Method: CantoASR employs forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, LoRA-finetuning of Whisper for tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware error correction.

Result: CantoASR demonstrated significant improvements in character error rate (CER) compared to Whisper-Large-V3 on spontaneous Cantonese speech data.

Conclusion: Integrating acoustic cues with large audio-language models offers a scalable and effective solution for low-resource tonal and dialect-specific speech recognition, improving performance on challenging languages like Cantonese.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

*Fahim Ahmed,Md Mubtasim Ahasan,Jahir Sadik Monon,Muntasir Wahed,M Ashraful Amin,A K M Mahbubur Rahman,Amin Ahsan Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper improves Text-to-SQL systems for natural language instructions using multi-agent pipelines that enhance the SQL query generation process, proving effective for various model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in SQL generation by LLMs, such as difficulties with large database schemas and complex reasoning steps.

Method: Three multi-agent LLM pipelines were explored: Multi-agent discussion pipeline, Planner-Coder pipeline, and Coder-Aggregator pipeline, systematically tested on small to large open-source models.

Result: Experiments showed significant improvements, with up to 10.6% increase in execution accuracy for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct via Multi-Agent discussion, and best results achieved using the Reasoner-Coder pipeline.

Conclusion: Smaller and efficient models can benefit from structured multi-agent collaboration, enhancing their Text-to-SQL generation capabilities across different benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-generated inflation and compression of communication create a loss of authenticity, and LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) seeks to reestablish genuine exchanges with structured dialogue, investigating trustworthiness aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of authentic communication caused by the excessive verbosity and subsequent compression of AI-generated content.

Method: Proposing LAAC, a paradigm where LLMs serve as intermediaries to capture sender intent and facilitate structured knowledge exchange. Evaluated through three dimensions: fidelity, reproducibility, and integrity via controlled experiments.

Result: Preliminary findings highlight measurable trust issues in LAAC's architecture, indicating areas for improvement before deployment in critical communication contexts.

Conclusion: LAAC shows potential for enabling authentic communication but demands further refinement to resolve trust gaps for reliable use in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

### [61] [Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195)
*Nicolò Pagan,Petter Törnberg,Christopher A. Bail,Anikó Hannák,Christopher Barrie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new computational framework to assess whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) resemble realistic human language, revealing current limitations in human-like simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools struggle to robustly assess the realism of LLM-generated text or accurately calibrate such models to simulate human behavior.

Method: The authors propose a computational Turing test using BERT-based metrics and linguistic features to evaluate LLMs. They analyze nine models with five calibration methods to benchmark outputs on platforms like Twitter, Bluesky, and Reddit.

Result: Even with calibration, LLM outputs are still distinguishable from human-written text, particularly in areas like emotional tone. Instruction-tuned models perform worse, and increasing model size does not improve human-likeness.

Conclusion: Although the framework aids validation and calibration, current LLMs face significant limitations in accurately mimicking human behavior, highlighting a trade-off between human-likeness and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether large language models can pass a membership exam for Poland's National Appeal Chamber, finding that they currently cannot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the current capabilities of large language models in performing complex legal tasks such as passing a specialized qualifying exam.

Method: Testing several LLMs across different settings, including closed-book exams and Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods for both knowledge tests and practical judgment exercises.

Result: While models performed satisfactorily on the knowledge test, none of them passed the practical judgment exam, and their automated evaluations were inconsistent with official human judgments.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit limitations in logical reasoning, citation accuracy, and avoiding hallucinations, making them unsuitable to replace human judiciary work in Polish public procurement adjudication.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

### [63] [REMIND: Input Loss Landscapes Reveal Residual Memorization in Post-Unlearning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04228)
*Liran Cohen,Yaniv Nemcovesky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMIND proposes a novel method for verifying effective machine unlearning by detecting subtle residual influences of erased data using loss dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to verify machine unlearning effectiveness arises from growing privacy, safety, and regulatory concerns, with existing methods failing to capture residual influences in semantically similar data.

Method: REMIND evaluates unlearning by analyzing model loss patterns across small input variations, identifying flat and less steep loss profiles for unlearned data, requiring only query-based access.

Result: REMIND outperforms existing methods under similar computational constraints, shows robustness across models and datasets, and provides a sensitive measure of unlearning efficiency.

Conclusion: REMIND offers a reliable and interpretable framework to assess unlearning in language models, advancing the understanding of memorization and unlearning impact.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

*Alex Fang,Thomas Voice,Ruoming Pang,Ludwig Schmidt,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) do not utilize pre-training datasets efficiently, leaving potential for notable improvements by leveraging additional compute at test time and retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the efficiency of LLM pre-training in extracting knowledge from datasets, and evaluate methods to enhance dataset utilization through retrieval techniques.

Method: The study employed retrieval-augmented generation and test-time compute to quantify missed dataset value across scales, comparing performance gains using traditional pre-training datasets.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements were achieved on various benchmarks (MMLU, Math-500, SimpleQA), with retrieval demonstrating a 5x compute multiplier and yielding a 10 percentage point improvement for the LLaMA 3.1 8B model.

Conclusion: Existing pre-training methods fail to fully tap into the potential of datasets, highlighting opportunities for future advancements in dataset utilization during pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a computationally efficient graph-based method for automatically labeling topics extracted from textual data, achieving strong results compared to benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of extracting interpretable and meaningful labels from topic modeling methods, which often produce ambiguous word distributions, without relying on computationally demanding models.

Method: The method involves a graph-based approach that enriches topic words with semantically related terms and analyzes their relationships to determine suitable and interpretable topic labels.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional benchmarks and was comparable to ChatGPT-3.5 in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity while being more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The presented graph-based topic labeling approach effectively enhances interpretability and efficiency. The paper also identifies opportunities for further research to improve automation and interpretability in topic labeling.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSPO, a new RLVR algorithm that addresses limitations of GRPO and GSPO for training LLMs. It shows superior performance and stability by using sentence-level importance ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and low sampling efficiency issues in existing RLVR algorithms, GRPO and GSPO, which hamper the improvement of reasoning skills in LLMs.

Method: The authors propose SSPO, leveraging sentence-level importance ratios to balance the issues of GRPO and GSPO. They also introduce sentence entropy within PPO-CLIP to dynamically adjust clipping bounds, encouraging exploration.

Result: SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO and GSPO, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, showcasing superior efficiency in sampled data utilization.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively retains the strengths of GSPO while resolving its sampling inefficiencies, representing a significant advancement in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities through RLVR.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve data quality selection for training machine translation models to achieve robust and accurate translations while optimizing computational resources.

Method: The proposed approach uses a learner model and pre-trained reference model to calculate a learnability score. This score evaluates the utility of data points, combined with a batch selection strategy to optimize training efficiency and data relevance.

Result: Experiments using mBART and CCMatrix dataset report a fivefold increase in data efficiency compared to baseline. Computational efficiency improves by 24 using cached embeddings, and generalization for translation performance is enhanced.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively selects impactful data points for machine translation fine-tuning, leading to better efficiency, generalization, and translation quality compared to conventional random selection techniques.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' ability to perform temporal reasoning, using trivia questions from a 1940 Norwegian book posed in both English and Norwegian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well LLMs perform temporal reasoning and explore the impact of language and model size on performance.

Method: The authors posed trivia questions from a 1940 Norwegian book to various LLMs in both Norwegian and English, grading the quality of their answers using native speakers and LLM-based evaluation.

Result: English prompts consistently led to better results than Norwegian prompts, and larger models performed better overall.

Conclusion: Larger LLMs perform better in temporal reasoning tasks, while language choice impacts accuracy, with English yielding better results than Norwegian unexpectedly.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity that also estimates uncertainty and incorporates temporal modeling, addressing limitations in existing models.

Method: The paper introduces PTTSD, utilizing bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and either Gaussian or Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. The framework includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one configurations for predicting PHQ-8 scores from clinical interviews.

Result: PTTSD achieved state-of-the-art results on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ datasets with competitive MAE (e.g., 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC). The model demonstrated well-calibrated prediction intervals, showcasing improved interpretability and generality in comparison with existing models like MentalBERT.

Conclusion: PTTSD offers a practical depression detection tool showing both clinical relevance and interpretability. Its probabilistic approach highlights the importance of incorporating uncertainty modeling and attention mechanisms into predictive models for depression severity.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

*Surapon Nonesung,Teetouch Jaknamon,Sirinya Chaiophat,Natapong Nitarach,Chanakan Wittayasakpan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Adisai Na-Thalang,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) for Thai text-rich visual tasks, with a diverse dataset and insights into model challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal modeling benchmarks underrepresent Thai language, particularly in document structure understanding.

Method: Developing ThaiOCRBench, a human-annotated dataset of 2,808 samples across 13 task categories, for evaluation of VLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Proprietary VLMs outperform open-source models significantly, particularly in text recognition and handwritten content extraction. Key challenges include language bias, structural mismatch, and content hallucination.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench sets a standardized evaluation framework while providing insights to enhance Thai-language document understanding in VLMs.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

*Nikhil Abhyankar,Purvi Chaurasia,Sanchit Kabra,Ananya Srivastava,Vivek Gupta,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs’ reasoning abilities on real-world complex tables, revealing significant challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs due to their reliance on small and uniform tabular data.

Method: Developing RUST-BENCH, which consists of 7966 questions derived from 2031 real-world heterogeneous tables, covering two key domains (science and sports).

Result: LLMs struggle when reasoning through heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop challenges, showcasing limitations in current model designs.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH creates a new, advanced testbed for pushing forward research on LLM reasoning capabilities and addressing their weaknesses on complex tabular data.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

*Cuong Huynh,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the OUNLP system submitted to TSAR-2025 for readability-controlled text simplification utilizing large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in text simplification by exploring the relationship between performance and the gap in CEFR levels, improving readability and accessibility of texts.

Method: Their method involves multi-round simplification using GPT-4o with two strategies: MRS-Rule (rule-based approach) and MRS-Joint (combination of rule-based and LLM simplifications).

Result: The OUNLP system ranked 7th out of 20 teams in TSAR-2025, and further experimentation with MRS-Joint demonstrated promising improvements in multi-round simplifications.

Conclusion: Multi-round simplification with an initial LLM-based simplification can enhance the performance of readability-controlled text simplification systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

*Christos-Nikolaos Zacharopoulos,Revekka Kyriakoglou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the personality-like behaviors of LLMs using the Big Five Inventory-2 framework, showing differences in traits influenced by sampling temperature and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the personality-like behaviors of LLMs for responsible development and deployment.

Method: The study uses the Big Five Inventory-2 framework and hierarchical clustering to assess six LLMs under varying sampling temperatures.

Result: Significant differences in four personality dimensions were observed, with Neuroticism and Extraversion being sensitive to temperature changes. Distinct model clusters were detected through hierarchical clustering.

Conclusion: The findings reveal personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide insights for model tuning, selection, and ethical governance of AI systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

*Joshua Gao,Quoc Huy Pham,Subin Varghese,Silwal Saurav,Vedhus Hoskere*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGalyst, a framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in specialized domains. The framework is human-aligned and provides a systematic evaluation through improved metrics and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective evaluation tools for RAG systems in safety-critical, specialized domains due to the inadequacy of heuristic-based metrics and existing approaches that don't align sufficiently with human judgment.

Method: The paper develops RAGalyst, an automated framework featuring an agentic pipeline for generating synthetic QA datasets, an agentic filtering process for data fidelity, and refined metrics for Answer Correctness and Answerability. It uses prompt optimization for strong alignment with human annotations.

Result: RAGalyst was applied to RAG systems across military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering domains, revealing that performance varies significantly by context. No universal optimal configuration was found, and frequent reasons for low Answer Correctness were analyzed.

Conclusion: RAGalyst facilitates systematic evaluation of RAG systems, enabling uncovering domain-specific challenges and optimizing design trade-offs. It demonstrates the importance of tailored evaluations for building reliable RAG systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.
RAGalyst is available on our Github.

### [75] [Modeling Clinical Uncertainty in Radiology Reports: from Explicit Uncertainty Markers to Implicit Reasoning Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04506)
*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for handling explicit and implicit uncertainty in radiology reports to enable automated analysis and structured information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain vital diagnostic information but include uncertainty that limits automated analysis. Addressing this uncertainty can improve structured processing of clinical data.

Method: The authors developed a two-part framework: (i) quantifying explicit uncertainty using expert-validated, LLM-based rankings of hedging phrases and (ii) modeling implicit uncertainty by expanding diagnostic pathways for omitted findings.

Result: The results include the release of Lunguage++, an enriched version of the radiology report benchmark, enabling uncertainty-aware image classification and diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: This new framework and resource advance automated clinical decision-making by accounting for diagnostic uncertainty, offering tools to study its clinical impact.

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

*Amir Zur,Atticus Geiger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Eric Bigelow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how reasoning language models indicate their uncertainty and represent alternate reasoning paths using hidden activations during text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether reasoning language models internally represent alternate paths they could take and improve interpretability through predicting uncertainty.

Method: Hidden activations in language models are analyzed during chain-of-thought reasoning to study their correlation with uncertainty and model steering ability.

Result: There is a strong correlation between a model's uncertainty on tokens and its ability to be controlled via activation interventions, suggesting models represent possible alternate paths.

Conclusion: Language models implicitly represent reasoning paths and their uncertainty can be harnessed to predict outcomes and improve model control during text generation.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

*Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab,Katharine Kowalyshyn,Kabir Pamnani,Anesu Gavhera,Vasanth Sarathy,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntelliProof utilizes LLMs to create argumentation graphs for essays, visually demonstrating argument structures and coherence while allowing human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the user experience in analyzing argumentative essays and bridge the gap between structural semantics and text comprehension.

Method: The system constructs argumentation graphs with nodes (claims), properties (supporting evidence), and edges (relations), leveraging LLMs for scoring and visualization.

Result: IntelliProof provides visualized argument structures, coherence measures, and justifications for classifications, enabling easier exploration of argumentative essays.

Conclusion: IntelliProof improves essay analysis with interactive tools and visualization, combining human oversight and automated coherence scoring.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system
are available here to try: \textbf{https://intelliproof.vercel.app}

*Cyril Vallez,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy,Ljiljana Dolamic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the cybersecurity risks posed by coding assistants based on Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing a Prompt Exposure and Model Exposure metrics to assess vulnerability severity and prevalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given the growing importance of LLM-based coding assistants, existing code generation vulnerabilities have implications for cybersecurity, warranting tools to better assess and mitigate risks.

Method: The paper introduces two metrics: Prompt Exposure (PE) to measure the severity and risk of vulnerabilities induced by LLM-generated code and Model Exposure (ME) to score model-specific vulnerability impacts.

Result: The authors identify that latest open-weight LLMs are still susceptible to known vulnerability scenarios and propose PE and ME metrics to systematically address these issues.

Conclusion: The study highlights that the current safety-functionality trade-off has limited effective vulnerability mitigation in LLMs and suggests prioritizing mitigation based on PE and ME scores.

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of accurate biomedical question-answering systems in low-resource languages like Bangla, aiming to improve equitable access to medical knowledge.

Method: The authors created BanglaMedQA and BanglaMMedBench datasets and applied diverse RAG strategies, integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus via OCR and a novel Agentic RAG pipeline to dynamically combine retrieval and reasoning methods.

Result: The Agentic RAG approach, powered by openai/gpt-oss-120b, achieved the highest accuracy of 89.54% and provided high-quality rationales, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: RAG-based strategies can significantly improve the accuracy and accessibility of Bangla medical QA systems, opening opportunities for multilingual medical AI research.

Abstract: Developing accurate biomedical Question Answering (QA) systems in
low-resource languages remains a major challenge, limiting equitable access to
reliable medical knowledge. This paper introduces BanglaMedQA and
BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical
artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining
textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual
accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus
through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG
pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies.
Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy
89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and
demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the
potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of
Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in
multilingual medical artificial intelligence.

*Alamgir Munir Qazi,John P. McCrae,Jamal Abdul Nasir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a lightweight framework for fact verification, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy than LLM-based methods while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of misinformation verification by creating a system that is both computationally efficient and accurate, overcoming the limitations of large language models (LLMs) like high computational costs and risks of data hallucination.

Method: The authors propose DeReC, which replaces autoregressive LLMs with dense retrieval combined with specialized classification using general-purpose text embeddings for fact verification tasks.

Result: DeReC surpasses LLM-based methods in efficiency by reducing runtime by 92% to 95% on two datasets and achieves an improved F1 score of 65.58% on the RAWFC dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art method, L-Defense (61.20%).

Conclusion: DeReC is a practical and efficient alternative to LLM-based systems for fact verification, demonstrating that retrieval-based systems can both meet and exceed the performance of LLMs while being better suited for real-world applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LEASH, a technique to efficiently halt rationale generation in large language models, reducing computational waste while achieving reasonable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost and token usage associated with full, fixed-length rationale generation in Chain-of-Thought prompting necessitate an efficient alternative for reasoning tasks.

Method: LEASH employs a training-free decoding algorithm using two intrinsic signals—entropy slope and top-logit margin improvement—to adaptively stop generation when reasoning stabilizes.

Result: LEASH reduces token generation by 30-35% and latency by 27% on GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, with a 10 percentage point drop in accuracy compared to full CoT.

Conclusion: LEASH demonstrates a simple, efficient, model-agnostic approach to streamline complex reasoning in large language models, though with some trade-off in accuracy.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex
reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length
rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.
We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free
decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors
two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in
the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau,
indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four
instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces
average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10
p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no
additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative
to CoT decoding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for CNNs to handle domain shifts in edge applications, reducing trainable parameters significantly while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory, compute, and energy constraints in edge devices during CNN fine-tuning for domain shifts, particularly in Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

Method: Uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD), selectively updates the output-side core, and fuses updates back into dense kernels to preserve inference efficiency.

Result: LoRA-Edge updates only up to 1.49% of parameters and achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning, outperforming prior methods under similar resource constraints. Additionally, it achieves faster convergence on devices like Jetson Orin Nano.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge demonstrates the feasibility of structure-aligned, parameter-efficient CNN fine-tuning for edge devices, making it practical for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SILVI, an open-source annotation software for analyzing interactions and behaviors in video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in annotation tools that either focus solely on behavioral labeling or localization without capturing interactions.

Method: SILVI integrates functionalities for annotating behaviors and interactions directly within video data, generating outputs for computer vision model development.

Result: SILVI provides structured outputs suitable for training and validating automated models in behavioral ecology and beyond.

Conclusion: SILVI bridges the gap between behavioral ecology and computer vision, facilitating advancements in analyzing fine-grained behaviors and interactions.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,

### [84] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates noise injection techniques to improve the generalizability of deep learning models for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, significantly reducing the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for image recognition, including COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays, often fail to generalize well to out-of-distribution data from new clinical sources, partly because they exploit shortcuts (source-specific artifacts) instead of robust biomarkers.

Method: The study employs fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, Salt and Pepper) during training to make models more robust to distribution shifts.

Result: Using noise injection methods, the performance disparity between in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data reduced from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, and specificity metrics, based on tests over ten random seeds.

Conclusion: Noise injection during training can enhance the generalization of deep learning models for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, making them more robust to new clinical sources. This method can address distribution shift issues effectively.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results

### [85] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans excel at interpreting social interactions from visuals using 3D pose information, which current AI models lack, but incorporating these features can improve AI predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social interaction recognition as it surpasses current AI capabilities, aiming to bridge the gap in AI vision systems.

Method: Used state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation to extract 3D joint positions from videos, compared their performance against AI models, and derived minimal 3D social pose features.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed current AI models, with simplified 3D pose features improving AI model performance and matching human judgment capabilities.

Conclusion: Humans rely on explicit 3D pose representations for social judgments, and integrating structured visuospatial features can enhance AI social scene understanding.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using imitation learning policies for bi-plane X-ray-guided spinal procedures, achieving a success rate of 68.5% in simulation and showing promise for real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether imitation learning-based robotic control policies can handle complex X-ray-guided procedures such as spine instrumentation.

Method: It creates a realistic in silico simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures, curates trajectory data, trains imitation learning policies, and evaluates them on open-loop alignment tasks based solely on visual input.

Result: The model successfully achieved safe intra-pedicular trajectories with a success rate of 68.5%, showing robustness across varied anatomy, cases, and initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays suggest plausible applicability.

Conclusion: Imitation learning policies show promise for lightweight and CT-free robotic spinal navigation, but limitations like entry point precision and feedback frequency must be addressed for full closed-loop control.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses global waste challenges with a proposed enhanced lightweight YOLOv12 model for real-time detection of waste in desert environments using drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The waste crisis is intensifying globally, especially in remote or harsh areas like deserts, where traditional waste collection methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and hazardous.

Method: The study utilizes a pruned YOLOv12 framework integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and advanced data augmentation techniques, benchmarked on the DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: The proposed model improves precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP), and achieves low latency with a compact size suitable for deployment on drones.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements provides a robust and efficient solution for real-time waste detection in challenging desert terrains.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [88] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg), a method to improve deep learning outcomes on small, imbalanced datasets by combining images of the same class into visual composites. Experiments yielded superior results over standard techniques, notably on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset (OCTDL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges faced by deep learning models, such as poor performance on small, imbalanced datasets and low-quality input images.

Method: Proposed a technique called Class-Based Image Composition, which fuses multiple images of the same class into Composite Input Images (CoImg) to increase intra-class variance and information density, evaluated using a balanced derived dataset (Co-OCTDL) on a VGG16 model.

Result: The proposed approach using CoImg achieved nearly perfect results with 99.6% accuracy, 0.995 F1-score, and 0.9996 AUC on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset. False prediction rates were significantly reduced compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Class-Based Image Composition is highly effective for addressing issues of class imbalance and small sample size in datasets, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and reliability, especially in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [89] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose an unsupervised framework that improves anomaly detection in medical imaging by incrementally learning normal samples without relying on labeled anomalies or expert supervision. The method demonstrates improved performance on various medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging lacks labeled anomalies, and expert supervision is costly, making anomaly detection a challenge. This paper aims to address this limitation to improve anomaly detection in such environments.

Method: The approach begins with a small seed of verified normal samples and alternates between adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample admission. A pretrained vision model is refined using lightweight adapters while embeddings are stored in a compact coreset for anomaly scoring using k-NN. Probabilistic gates enforce safety during data expansion without requiring generative reconstructions.

Result: The method enhances performance on datasets such as COVID-CXR, Pneumonia CXR, and Brain MRI ND-5, achieving better ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores, compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and efficient for real-world medical imaging applications with scarce labeled data, incrementally refining the definition of normality and achieving significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for sharper boundaries and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for efficient action localization, improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in precise boundary detection in temporal action localization by optimizing computation and providing better localization methods.

Method: The paper proposes BDR (signed-distance regression) for sharper boundary peaks and ATR (continuous depth selection) for adaptive computation, which are retrofitted onto existing systems.

Result: BDR improves mAP@0.7 by 1.8 to 3.1%, while ATR achieves higher performance (56.5% mAP@0.7 at lower computation). Gains are validated across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance action localization accuracy and efficiency, particularly for heterogeneous and short actions, with reduced computation and training cost.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified approach for optimizing geometry and appearance of 3D objects using Gaussian-guided differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack integration of geometry and appearance optimization, impacting downstream editing tasks.

Method: A novel framework is introduced to optimize mesh geometry and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering with photometric and geometric regularization.

Result: The approach yields high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: Unified optimization of geometry and appearance benefits 3D reconstruction and enables better utilization in editing applications. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is essential for effective 3D reconstruction with light field cameras, a challenging task.

Method: Proposes a linear fractional transformation parameter to decouple components, with analytical and non-linear refinement methods for calibration. Also includes a feature detection approach for raw images.

Result: Experimental validation using physical and simulated data demonstrates the method's effectiveness for calibration and raw light field image simulation.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves calibration accuracy, accelerates raw light field image simulation, aiding data-driven deep learning methods. Code availability on the author's website could facilitate adoption.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw

*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset "Room Envelopes" to improve monocular geometry estimation for reconstructing occluded structural elements of indoor scenes, such as walls and ceilings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods fail to recover occluded structural surfaces like walls, floors, and ceilings due to their focus on visible surfaces. The paper intends to simplify and enhance the prediction of these structural elements using a tailored approach.

Method: The authors developed a synthetic dataset named "Room Envelopes." This dataset includes RGB images and pointmaps capturing visible surfaces along with separate structural layouts. Feed-forward monocular geometry estimators are used for direct supervision, predicting visible and layout surfaces simultaneously.

Result: The dataset and method enabled the estimators to better understand scene extent, objects' shapes, and locations, improving reconstruction accuracy for occluded areas.

Conclusion: The study shows that structural elements in indoor scenes can be accurately predicted using simple and cost-effective methods paired with appropriately designed datasets like Room Envelopes.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF) for 3D segmentation in Gaussian fields, promoting multi-view consistency and addressing cross-view discrepancies with enhanced camera encoding and supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines for 3D Gaussian splatting segmentation struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo-supervision and view-specific feature learning.

Method: The paper proposes CaRF, featuring Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to incorporate camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions and In-Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align logits across views for better consistency.

Result: CaRF achieves significant improvements in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods across three benchmarks: +16.8% on Ref LERF, +4.3% on LERF OVS, and +2.0% on 3D OVS datasets.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding with potential applications in embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models suffer from issues related to physical plausibility, such as incoherent interactions and unrealistic motion, which limit their applicability in areas like robotics and simulation.

Method: PhysCorr employs 'PhysicsRM,' a dual-dimensional reward model quantifying intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. It further uses 'PhyDPO,' a direct preference optimization pipeline with contrastive feedback and physics-aware weighting, for improvement. The approach is model-agnostic and integrates with various video generation backbones.

Result: PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in generating physically realistic videos, maintaining visual quality and semantic accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: PhysCorr represents an important development toward more reliable and physically accurate text-to-video generation models, enhancing their applicability in advanced domains like AI and robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Motivation: Efficiently adapting pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for domain generalization is challenging due to the high cost and potential generalization issues of standard fine-tuning.

Method: The authors introduce GNN-MoE which integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework with Kronecker adapters, employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) routers to dynamically assign patches to experts based on inter-patch graph relationships.

Result: GNN-MoE demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance on domain generalization benchmarks while being highly parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing via GNN-MoE improves robust domain generalization for ViTs, enabling lightweight and efficient adaptation to unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,

specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedDChest, a vision model optimized for thoracic imaging, pre-trained on a multimodal dataset of medical images and employing a novel data augmentation technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision models are limited by using backbones pre-trained on natural images, creating a domain gap that hampers performance in thoracic imaging.

Method: Developed MedDChest, a Vision Transformer model trained on 1.2 million curated medical images using Guided Random Resized Crops, a content-aware data augmentation technique focused on anatomically relevant regions.

Result: MedDChest achieves superior performance on multiple thoracic diagnostic tasks compared to ImageNet-pretrained models.

Conclusion: The model establishes the benefits of in-domain pre-training and novel data augmentation techniques, offering a robust foundation for thoracic imaging tasks, with public availability of its weights to support further research.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring introduces a sparse voxelized representation for 3D meshes, achieving high fidelity, exceptional accuracy, and efficiency without needing traditional iso-surface techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxelized representations of 3D meshes compromise geometric fidelity due to reliance on water-tightening or iso-surface extraction processes.

Method: The study proposes a novel method called Faithful Contouring which supports high-resolution sparse voxelized representations for arbitrary meshes, bypassing traditional mesh conversion processes while preserving sharpness and complex internal geometry.

Result: Faithful Contouring achieves near-lossless fidelity for complex 3D meshes. It significantly improves accuracy with $10^{-5}$ distance error in direct representation, 93% reduction in Chamfer Distance, and 35% improvement in F-score for mesh reconstruction.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Faithful Contouring outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, proving its effectiveness as a 3D representation technique for reconstruction and learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh

### [99] [A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037)
*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biometric authentication framework using PPG signals from low-frame-rate fingertip videos, achieving 98% accuracy with a hybrid model combining CVT, ConvMixer, and LSTM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals are gaining attention for biometric authentication due to their non-invasive nature, liveness detection, and suitability for low-cost devices, but challenges such as motion artifacts and physiological variability hinder their reliability.

Method: PPG signals are preprocessed using techniques like PCA, filtering, and normalization, followed by conversion into scalograms using Continuous Wavelet Transform. A hybrid deep learning model, CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, is developed to combine spatial and temporal features.

Result: The authentication framework achieves 98% accuracy on the CFIHSR dataset comprising PPG recordings from 46 subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust, efficient, and scalable, making it ideal for mobile and embedded biometric security applications with liveness detection capability.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bratrix, an end-to-end framework for aligning brain signals with visual and linguistic semantic components, improving performance in retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to align neural signals with latent semantic dimensions due to subject variability and the highly intertwined nature of visual features, limiting interpretability and robustness.

Method: Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical semantic components (visual and linguistic), projecting them into a shared latent space for brain-language and visual-language alignment. It uses a novel uncertainty perception module and a two-stage strategy combining single-modality pretraining and multimodal fine-tuning.

Result: Bratrix demonstrates improved performance in various benchmarks (EEG, MEG, fMRI), with significant gains, such as a 14.3% improvement in 200-way EEG retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Bratrix enhances multimodal semantic alignment and perceptual reliability, advancing the ability to interpret neural signals linked to visual and semantic representations. Its code and model are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates CT image denoising using CycleGAN and Noise2Score approaches under unpaired and self-supervised regimes. CycleGAN shows stronger final image quality while Noise2Score demonstrates robust performance without requiring clean pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve CT image denoising using training-data-efficient methods like CycleGAN and Noise2Score, especially in scenarios lacking paired clean and noisy data.

Method: Examined CycleGAN (with optimized hyperparameters and U-Net backbone) and Noise2Score (score-matching denoiser) using a common evaluation protocol for unpaired and self-supervised denoising.

Result: CycleGAN improved image quality from 34.66 dB SSIM to 38.913 dB SSIM and achieved higher Kaggle leaderboard scores. Noise2Score excelled in denoising extremely noisy inputs, making it useful where clean data is scarce.

Conclusion: CycleGAN yields the best image quality overall, while Noise2Score emerges as a robust alternative for contexts lacking clean input data.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UKAST, a hybrid architecture combining the Swin Transformer and a new rational function-based approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation with high accuracy even in data-scarce conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of medical image segmentation caused by complex anatomy and limited labeled data. The paper aims to overcome shortcomings of CNNs (local feature limitations) and Transformers (data hunger and computation costs).

Method: UKAST integrates rational-function-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Swin Transformer encoders, leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) for improved data efficiency and reduced computational cost.

Result: The proposed UKAST model outperforms CNN- and Transformer-based methods on four 2D and 3D medical image segmentation datasets, excelling particularly in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: UKAST demonstrates the potential to enhance medical image segmentation by combining the strengths of Transformers and novel rational-function-based techniques, achieving high data efficiency with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

*Biao Liu,Yuanzhi Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLock is a novel framework for text-to-image synthesis focused on improving object localization using Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods struggle with precise object localization due to inadequate use of positional information and spatial layout understanding.

Method: SpatialLock uses two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) for integrating spatial information through attention layers, and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) that applies perception-based supervision for refining spatial arrangements.

Result: SpatialLock achieves state-of-the-art results in precise object positioning, with Intersection over Union (IOU) scores exceeding 0.9 across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SpatialLock effectively enhances object spatial arrangement and visual quality in text-to-image generation, leveraging perception and grounding signals for significant improvements.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a method to speed up diffusion sampling without requiring model retraining and maintains high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of diffusion sampling methods, reducing computational costs while preserving output fidelity, addressing inefficiencies in conventional solvers.

Method: The authors reformulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a multirate system of ODEs, introducing strategies to separately integrate noise estimates and additional guidance terms through different timesteps for efficiency.

Result: THG reduces the number of function evaluations by up to 30%, while maintaining image generation quality with negligible loss, outperforming similar state-of-the-art methods within the same computational budget.

Conclusion: The study illustrates the effectiveness of multirate formulations like THG in achieving efficient, real-time, high-quality image generation, requiring no model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3S, a training-free sketch generation framework using diffusion models with explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sketch generation lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles.

Method: The authors propose integrating reference features with linear smoothing and using a style-content guidance mechanism to reduce content leakage and improve synthesis quality.

Result: The framework demonstrated high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and flexibility in controlling styles.

Conclusion: M3S enhances sketch generation by utilizing diffusion models for effective style control and supports multi-style generation through auxiliary feature integration.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DMSORT, a novel parallel tracking architecture for maritime multi-object tracking (MOT) that achieves high accuracy amidst challenges like camera motion and visual degradation, evaluated on Singapore Maritime Dataset with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in maritime MOT caused by dynamic environmental factors such as camera motion and visual degradation, which affect vessel navigation safety and maritime surveillance.

Method: The authors present DMSORT, a dual-branch framework with affine compensation. It includes a ReID branch and camera motion estimation branch, with key components such as a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) for object detection and a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE). Motion stabilization is achieved with platform-induced motion compensation in the Kalman filter, and a clustering-optimized feature fusion module combines motion and appearance cues.

Result: The DMSORT framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in maritime MOT tasks on the Singapore Maritime Dataset. It excels in both speed and identity consistency under challenging conditions of jitter, occlusion, and noise.

Conclusion: DMSORT is an efficient and accurate solution for maritime MOT, offering robust performance and runtime efficiency in complex environments. Its novel architecture and modules enhance the safety and effectiveness of maritime operations.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework enabling computer-use agents to leverage online videos for learning procedural knowledge and improving decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance computer-use agents' ability to perform tasks requiring domain-specific procedural knowledge by utilizing structured information extracted from online tutorial videos.

Method: The framework retrieves tutorial videos, processes them into structured trajectories using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for action segmentation and textual objectives, and employs a two-stage selection mechanism during inference to dynamically pick the most relevant trajectory for guidance.

Result: Experiments on key benchmarks demonstrate the framework's superior performance over baseline agents and variants using only textual tutorials, showing the importance of trajectory segmentation, action filtering, and visual cues.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systemically converted into actionable inputs, providing significant improvements to computer-use agents when navigating complex tasks at inference time.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misalignment of scanned or photographed documents due to user errors during capture negatively impacts tasks like OCR, necessitating robust rotation correction.

Method: The authors introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a benchmark for assessing OCR rotation robustness, and develop a rotation classification pipeline using the Phi-3.5 Vision model with fine-tuning and dynamic cropping for 4-class rotation task.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96% and 92% accuracy for rotation classification on English and Indic datasets, significantly improving OCR performance in real-world simulated settings.

Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of accurate rotation correction, presenting ORB and a robust rotation classification model to enhance OCR performance on various datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how various color transformation techniques impact image registration between H&E stained and non-linear multimodal images and finds CycleGAN to be the most effective method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image registration accuracy in digital pathology by exploring the impact of different color transformation techniques between multimodal images.

Method: The authors tested several color transformation techniques (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane) alongside preprocessing steps and evaluated their effect on image registration performance using the VALIS method and error metrics like rTRE.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation consistently achieved the lowest registration errors compared to other methods, improving the alignment of multimodal images.

Conclusion: Using advanced color transformation methods, such as CycleGAN, before registration leads to better alignment of multimodal pathology images, aiding reliable analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Motivation: Covariance descriptors are effective in general computer vision tasks but are underutilized in medical imaging. The paper aims to investigate their usability and effectiveness in medical image classification.

Method: The paper uses covariance descriptors constructed from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (DINOv2 and MedSAM), comparing their performance against handcrafted descriptors across eleven datasets in the MedMNIST benchmark.

Result: Covariance descriptors built from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted descriptors, and SPDNet with DINOv2 features surpasses state-of-the-art performance on medical image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Covariance descriptors, particularly when combined with powerful pretrained general vision encoders, hold significant potential for improving medical image classification.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new model for human motion style transfer that incorporates additional statistical metrics (skewness and kurtosis) to better capture motion dynamics, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for motion style transfer fail to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence of motion data since they rely only on mean and variance, like traditional image style transfer models.

Method: The authors propose a novel Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF), which incorporates a Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). They also use Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) to improve the training process.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that AStF offers superior performance in motion style transfer compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering better adherence to spatiotemporal statistical properties of dynamic styles.

Conclusion: Integrating additional statistical coefficients like skewness and kurtosis provides a more robust framework for motion style transfer, leading to improved results and a better understanding of motion dynamics.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts a human-centric model for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, establishing state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore overlooked opportunities in adapting human-centric foundation models optimized for spatial localization to medical imaging tasks, particularly anatomical landmark detection.

Method: The method involves adapting the Sapiens model (originally designed for human pose estimation) to medical imaging using multi-dataset pretraining, creating the MedSapiens model.

Result: MedSapiens achieves significant improvements in average success detection rate (SDR) over specialist models (up to 21.81%) and generalist models (up to 5.26%). It also excels in limited-data settings, improving few-shot performance by 2.69% over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models such as Sapiens can be effectively adapted and optimized for anatomical landmark detection tasks in medical imaging, demonstrating untapped potential.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet proposes a signal-leak-aware model to improve source attribution and authenticity verification in identifying synthetic images and deepfakes, achieving robust results with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in synthetic image and deepfake generation are challenging source attribution and authenticity verification, highlighting the need for more reliable forensic methods.

Method: Proto-LeakNet operates in the latent domain of diffusion models, utilizing re-simulated partial forward diffusion and a temporal attention encoder combined with a feature-weighted prototype head for attribution.

Result: Proto-LeakNet achieved a Macro AUC of 98.13%, exceeded state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated strong separability between known and unseen generators, even under post-processing.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space significantly improves AI-image and deepfake forensic analysis, providing reliable and interpretable solutions for authenticity verification.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

### [116] [DINOv2 Driven Gait Representation Learning for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04281)
*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) seeks robust cross-modal retrieval, utilizing gait features alongside visual characteristics. The proposed DinoGRL framework improves spatiotemporal modeling through DINOv2-driven gait representation learning, enhancing retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VVI-ReID approaches often overlook modality-invariant gait features, which hold temporal dynamics useful for cross-modal video matching. This gap limits the efficient modeling of spatiotemporal consistency essential for optimal retrieval.

Method: The authors propose the DinoGRL framework incorporating DINOv2's visual priors to learn task-specific gait features that complement appearance cues. This entails the development of the SASGL model for semantic-aware silhouette enhancement, and the PBMGE module to refine feature representations via multi-granularity bidirectional interactions.

Result: Experiments conducted on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets highlight the significant performance improvements of DinoGRL compared to state-of-the-art methods in VVI-ReID tasks.

Conclusion: DinoGRL framework effectively integrates gait characteristics with appearance features, demonstrating notable advancements in cross-modal video person re-identification over existing approaches. Its innovative methods improve spatiotemporal representation for accurate video matching.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Shiwei Ren,Tianci Wen,Yongchun Fang,Biao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS introduces an acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that prioritizes rendering efficiency. It achieves significant speedups while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods face challenges due to redundant computational overhead without proper Gaussian regulation.

Method: FastGS employs a multi-view consistency approach for densification and pruning without relying on a budgeting mechanism.

Result: FastGS achieves up to 15.45× faster training compared to existing methods, with comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: FastGS improves training speed significantly while offering strong generality for various 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

*Leire Benito-Del-Valle,Artzai Picón,Daniel Mugica,Manuel Ramos,Eva Portillo,Javier Romero,Carlos Javier Jimenez,Ramón Navarra-Mestre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a domain-specific vision model for herbicide trial analysis, outperforming general models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address limitations of general-purpose vision models in accurately identifying plant species and herbicide-induced damage amidst agricultural complexities.

Method: A self-supervised learning approach was used to train a domain-specific vision model on a large curated agricultural dataset to enable high-performance herbicide trial analysis.

Result: The domain-specific model outperformed general-purpose models in species and damage classification under various conditions, achieving higher F1 scores and reducing labeled data reliance.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, better performance under domain-specific conditions, and reduced manual annotation, paving the way for scalable herbicide trial automation.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores how synthetic data improves deep learning models (YOLOv10) for detecting offshore infrastructure using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, achieving high performance across multiple regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing global deployment of offshore infrastructure such as wind farms and oil platforms necessitates robust and transferable remote sensing models for effective monitoring, often hindered by unbalanced datasets and limited sample availability.

Method: The study used a YOLOv10 object detection model trained on a mix of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite data, acquired from four distinct maritime regions, to improve detection capabilities in other unseen regions.

Result: The trained model detected 3,529 offshore platforms in three different regions (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, and Persian Gulf) with an F1 score of 0.85, which increased to 0.90 when synthetic data was included.

Conclusion: The incorporation of synthetic data enhances the detection of underrepresented classes and shapes, contributing to the development of globally transferable deep learning models for offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V introduces an innovative framework to improve text-to-video diffusion models using prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction in a unified step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current text-to-video diffusion models in understanding concise prompts and aligning videos with user intent due to inadequate semantic understanding.

Method: The proposed RISE-T2V integrates prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction via the Rephrasing Adapter, which utilizes hidden states from pre-trained LLMs during video generation.

Result: RISE-T2V improves the scalability, usability, and video quality of T2V models, achieving better alignment of generated videos with user intent across various architectures.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V significantly enhances text-to-video model performance and versatility, pushing forward high-quality video generation personalized to user prompts.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel automated segmentation method for tumors in 3D medical images using voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks, achieving high accuracy while reducing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in 3D tumor segmentation due to the large number of voxels in scans, which lead to impractical computational requirements in clinical applications.

Method: A two-stage methodology involving voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks to enable high-resolution input segmentation with reduced computational demand.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art performance in renal cancer CT scans, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone, while significantly reducing inference time and VRAM usage.

Conclusion: This approach is effective and efficient for high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation, providing competitive accuracy with substantial reductions in computational resources, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of occlusion on 3D object detection using BEVFusion architecture, revealing significant performance drops for cameras and LiDAR under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated vehicles need accurate 3D object detection to safely navigate complex real-world environments. However, the effects of sensor occlusion on detection accuracy remain underexplored.

Method: The authors evaluated the impact of occlusions on camera and LiDAR sensors using BEVFusion on the nuScenes dataset, analyzing the detection performance with metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and nuScenes Detection Score (NDS).

Result: Moderate camera occlusions caused a 41.3% reduction in mAP, while LiDAR performance dropped 47.3% under heavy occlusion. Fusion settings showed the model preferred LiDAR, with camera occlusion causing a minor 4.1% drop in mAP and LiDAR occlusion causing a significant 26.8% drop.

Conclusion: The study shows the need for occlusion-aware evaluation and better sensor fusion techniques to enhance detection accuracy in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Result: The tutorial demonstrates the application of deep learning models through MATLAB code for various imaging modalities in analytical chemistry.

Conclusion: The work aims to facilitate the integration of deep learning approaches into analytical chemistry by offering a practical guide, enabling researchers to use deep features from imaging data along with other datasets.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial

medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded

### [127] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HideAndSeg, a minimally supervised AI tool designed to segment video footage of octopuses in challenging natural aquatic environments, demonstrating improved performance and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying octopuses in natural habitats is difficult due to factors like camouflage abilities, non-rigid body movements, underwater lighting variability, and the lack of annotated datasets for training segmentation tools.

Method: The authors present HideAndSeg, which integrates SAM2 with a YOLOv11 object detector. The approach begins with user-provided point coordinates for initial segmentation masks using SAM2, followed by custom YOLO training to automate the segmentation process with bounding box prompts to SAM2. Additionally, two unsupervised evaluation metrics, $DICE_t$ and $NC_t$, are introduced to assess quality.

Result: HideAndSeg demonstrated satisfactory performance in scenarios where manual segmentation failed, such as occlusions, yielding less segmentation noise and improved octopus re-identification in dynamic natural environments.

Conclusion: By automating video segmentation with minimal manual input, HideAndSeg provides an effective solution for studying octopus behavior in the wild, addressing practical challenges in aquatic video analysis.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

*Yaniv Ohayon,Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on solving convex polygonal puzzles computationally by introducing a greedy solver and benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of computational jigsaw solvers that primarily solve square puzzles, limiting practical applications.

Method: The authors combine geometrical and pictorial compatibilities to develop a greedy solver for convex polygonal puzzles and introduce a benchmark dataset for evaluation.

Result: Introduces a first-of-its-kind computational approach to solve convex partition puzzles and evaluates the approach using the benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The study broadens the scope of puzzle-solving algorithms to include convex polygonal puzzles, showcasing a new method and dataset for computational advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

*Runqi Qiao,Qiuna Tan,Minghan Yang,Guanting Dong,Peiqing Yang,Shiqiang Lang,Enhui Wan,Xiaowan Wang,Yida Xu,Lan Yang,Chong Sun,Chen Li,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces V-Thinker, a multimodal reasoning assistant enhancing large multimodal models (LMMs) with interactive, vision-centric thinking through reinforcement learning. It also establishes VTBench for benchmarking vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current large multimodal models (LMMs) in integrating detailed image interaction with long-horizon reasoning, aiming to enable deeper and more effective multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed method involves V-Thinker, which employs a Data Evolution Flywheel to develop high-quality datasets and a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum for reinforcement learning-based training in multimodal reasoning.

Result: The experiments show V-Thinker consistently surpassing existing LMM baselines in both general and interactive reasoning tasks, establishing it as a significant advancement for image-centered reasoning.

Conclusion: V-Thinker significantly improves multimodal reasoning with its vision-centric, interactive approach, while VTBench forms a benchmark for evaluating such tasks.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

*Wenwen Li,Sizhe Wang,Hyunho Lee,Chenyan Lu,Sujit Roy,Rahul Ramachandran,Chia-Yu Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced geospatial foundation model (GeoFM) for landslide mapping, demonstrating improved performance compared to other models, despite challenges like computational cost and data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance landslide mapping for disaster preparedness by overcoming limitations in conventional deep learning models, particularly in cross-sensor, cross-region, and low-training-data situations.

Method: The authors introduced the GeoFM, Prithvi-EO-2.0, with global pretraining, self-supervision, and fine-tuning. This framework adapts models across sensor, label, and domain axes for improved geospatial understanding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the model’s superiority over task-specific CNNs, vision transformers, and other GeoFMs, especially in handling spectral variations, label scarcity, and diverse datasets.

Conclusion: GeoFMs like Prithvi-EO-2.0 show promise for advancing landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring, though challenges such as computational costs and limited AI-ready training data remain.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

### [131] [THEval. Evaluation Framework for Talking Head Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04520)
*Nabyl Quignon,Baptiste Chopin,Yaohui Wang,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for talking head video generation, focusing on quality, naturalness, and synchronization through 8 metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for talking head video generation are inadequate and fail to keep up with the progress in video generation techniques.

Method: Proposes a framework to evaluate the fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, face quality, and builds an unbiased dataset for testing, alongside public leaderboards and code.

Result: Applied the framework to 85,000 videos from 17 state-of-the-art models, finding strength in lip synchronization but weakness in expressiveness and artifact-free generation.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a benchmark to improve generative methods, supporting the evolution of video generation techniques with public benchmarks and updates.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

*Dimitrios Anastasiou,Santiago Barbarisi,Lucy Culshaw,Jayna Patel,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STC-Net, a framework for estimating surgical complexity in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using full videos without manual curation, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surgical complexity assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is needed for better risk stratification and training, utilizing the Parkland Grading Scale in automated scenarios.

Method: STC-Net, a framework with modules for localization, window proposal, and grading, uses novel loss formulations for temporal localization and grading, operating on full videos under weak supervision.

Result: On a dataset of 1,859 videos, STC-Net achieved an accuracy of 62.11% and F1-score of 61.42%, significantly outperforming non-localized baselines.

Conclusion: The paper introduces STC-Net as a scalable and effective solution for automated estimation of surgical complexity, useful for post-operative analysis and surgical training.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

*Jingqi Tong,Yurong Mou,Hangcheng Li,Mingzhe Li,Yongzhuo Yang,Ming Zhang,Qiguang Chen,Tianyi Liang,Xiaomeng Hu,Yining Zheng,Xinchi Chen,Jun Zhao,Xuanjing Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current reasoning paradigms in language and vision models and introduces 'Thinking with Video' as a new paradigm using video generation models for unified multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of text-only or image-based paradigms in reasoning, such as the inability to capture dynamic processes and the lack of unified multimodal understanding.

Method: The authors propose the 'Thinking with Video' paradigm using video generation models (e.g., Sora-2) to enable unified reasoning across temporal and multimodal dimensions. A benchmark, VideoThinkBench, was developed to evaluate its performance on both vision-centric and text-centric tasks.

Result: Sora-2 exhibited performance comparable to or exceeding current state-of-the-art models in vision and text-centric tasks, achieving 92% accuracy on MATH and 75.53% on MMMU.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates video generation models' potential as a unified multimodal reasoning tool, positioning 'Thinking with Video' as a promising paradigm for integrating textual and visual reasoning.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

*Chen Shi,Shaoshuai Shi,Xiaoyang Lyu,Chunyang Liu,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSplat introduces a feed-forward framework for robust 3D dynamic scene reconstruction using unified spatio-temporal fusion and a dual-branch decoding mechanism, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D reconstruction in autonomous driving struggle with sparse camera views and complicated scene dynamics, requiring a robust solution to unify spatial and temporal information.

Method: UniSplat builds a 3D latent scaffold using foundation models to encode geometric and semantic context, employs efficient fusion mechanisms directly in this scaffold, and uses a dual-branch decoder with dynamic-aware Gaussians and persistent memory for static reconstructions.

Result: Experimental results prove UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance and produces high-quality renderings for positions outside the original camera coverage.

Conclusion: UniSplat is effective in advancing dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving, offering robust and consistent spatio-temporal alignments and detailed scene generation.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

*Yicheng Xiao,Yu Chen,Haoxuan Ma,Jiale Hong,Caorui Li,Lingxiang Wu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP introduces a method to enhance CLIP for fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating visual prompts and extended textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP models struggle with fine-grained image-text alignment due to limitations in processing long, granular textual information.

Method: PixCLIP replaces CLIP's text encoder with an LLM and employs a three-branch pixel-text alignment framework, along with an automated annotation pipeline to create the LongGRIT dataset with pixel-level localized textual data.

Result: Experiments show PixCLIP achieves state-of-the-art pixel-level interaction and improves handling of long-form texts.

Conclusion: PixCLIP effectively enhances fine-grained vision-language alignment, proving to be superior in processing detailed visual and textual information.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [136] [Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615)
*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to accurately evaluate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain models, emphasizing pixel-level stain accuracy over conventional image fidelity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture- and distribution-based metrics insufficiently evaluate virtual IHC images, as they focus on image fidelity rather than accurate pixel-level IHC labeling.

Method: The framework uses color deconvolution to create IHC-positive pixel masks for both real and virtual IHC images. Metrics such as Dice, IoU, and Hausdorff distance are deployed to assess pixel-level stain accuracy without manual annotations.

Result: Conventional fidelity metrics (e.g., FID, PSNR, SSIM) poorly correlate with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models like PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE outperform unpaired models in accuracy. Whole-slide image analysis exposes performance declines not visible in patch-based evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reliable and reproducible method to assess virtual IHC model quality, paving the way for its adoption in routine pathological diagnosis.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a no-reference, opinion-unaware video quality assessment model utilizing synthetic degradations and temporal-aware architecture, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods either require clean reference videos (FR metrics) or rely on costly human opinion data, and image-based NR methods often neglect relevant temporal information.

Method: The work uses synthetic degradations on the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional model to predict full-reference metrics directly from degraded videos without requiring references at inference.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms image-based baselines in adaptability and accuracy for diverse degradations, and shows higher correlation with FR metrics compared to BRISQUE.

Conclusion: The model's temporal modeling and opinion-unaware design provide a scalable and effective solution for video quality assessment in practical applications.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a polarization-enabled eye tracking system (PET) that uses polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging to improve gaze tracking accuracy under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing eye tracking systems based on intensity imaging face challenges such as eyelid occlusions and pupil-size variations, reducing accuracy. The authors aimed to explore how adding polarization contrast can address these issues and improve performance.

Method: The authors developed a PET system utilizing a polarization-filter-array camera and a linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator, combined with convolutional neural network-based machine learning models to analyze gaze patterns.

Result: The study demonstrated a 10-16% improvement in gaze error reduction (median 95th-percentile) relative to conventional methods across 346 participants. This improvement occurred even under challenging conditions like eyelid occlusions and pupil-size variations.

Conclusion: Polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) offers improved performance, proving to be a promising, robust sensing modality for future wearable devices and enhancing human-computer interaction through more accurate gaze tracking capabilities.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and proposes methods to evaluate and improve benchmark robustness against non-visual biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal benchmarks do not adequately assess visual understanding, as models can exploit biases, linguistic patterns, and trivial correlations.

Method: The researchers introduced the Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) methodology and Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to identify and mitigate biases in benchmarks. These tools include k-fold cross-validation with textual inputs to assess biases and a Random Forest-based approach for auditing.

Result: The framework was applied to VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME, revealing significant non-visual biases. A debiased version of VSI-Bench was created, showing improvements in reducing biases and a distinct gap in vision-related performance.

Conclusion: Benchmarking for multimodal models requires careful bias analysis and debiasing procedures to ensure true visual understanding is assessed, thereby improving benchmark validity and reliability.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

*Ellis Brown,Arijit Ray,Ranjay Krishna,Ross Girshick,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIMS-V, a framework utilizing 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data, improving multimodal language models' spatial reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models show limitations in spatial reasoning, and obtaining diverse and annotated real-world video data remains a challenge.

Method: SIMS-V framework uses 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video data for training language models. It identifies effective question categories driving real-world data transfer and develops efficient training strategies.

Result: Models trained using SIMS-V outperform larger baselines, achieving strong spatial reasoning capabilities and competitive video understanding performance on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SIMS-V leverages simulated data effectively, enabling efficient training, robust generalization, and improved spatial reasoning in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift to 'supersensing' for achieving true multimodal intelligence beyond traditional methods. They introduce a new benchmark, VSI-SUPER, to assess advanced spatial cognition and predictive modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal intelligence systems rely on reactive and task-driven methods, which are insufficient for achieving true multimodal intelligence. There's a need for models capable of advanced spatial cognition and world modeling.

Method: The authors introduce VSI-SUPER, consisting of two benchmarks: VSR (visual spatial recall) and VSC (visual spatial counting). They train a model, Cambrian-S, using VSI-590K dataset and present a predictive sensing approach using self-supervised next-latent-frame prediction.

Result: Cambrian-S achieved significant improvements on VSI-Bench (+30% absolute improvement), but its performance on VSI-SUPER remains constrained, showing scalability challenges. Predictive sensing methods showed superior performance on VSI-SUPER compared to baseline benchmarks.

Conclusion: Spatial supersensing models must evolve to incorporate anticipatory and organizational functions, as mere scale is insufficient. Predictive sensing offers a promising direction for future advancements in multimodal intelligence systems.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityStar is a unified framework for high-resolution image and video synthesis that outperforms autoregressive and diffusion-based models in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance high-resolution video and image synthesis by leveraging the capabilities of autoregressive modeling to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal dynamics.

Method: Developed a discrete autoregressive model, InfinityStar, which integrates spatial and temporal dependencies into a single architecture, supporting multiple generation tasks.

Result: InfinityStar achieves 83.74 on VBench, surpassing other autoregressive models and some diffusion-based competitors like HunyuanVideo, while generating videos faster and at higher resolutions.

Conclusion: InfinityStar addresses challenges in high-quality video synthesis by providing a unified, efficient, and scalable framework, establishing a new standard in autoregressive video generation.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

### [143] [Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678)
*Yihong Sun,Xinyu Yang,Jennifer J. Sun,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for tracking objects through transformations, detecting their state changes, and providing state graphs, using the proposed TubeletGraph framework and a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to track objects after significant state transformations due to considerable object appearance changes. The authors seek to address this gap by enabling better state-aware object tracking.

Method: The authors developed TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that identifies missed tracks based on semantic and proximity priors, integrates them, and generates a state graph to describe transformations over time.

Result: TubeletGraph delivers state-of-the-art performance in tracking objects through transformations, providing deeper insights into object state evolutions, and demonstrating strong capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: The TubeletGraph system effectively addresses the challenge of tracking objects through significant transformations, setting a new benchmark in state-aware object tracking and reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for creating multiple distinct, aesthetically appealing image crops, particularly relevant for modern applications like social media.

Method: The authors introduced a dataset of 277 images with human labels and leveraged an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step before applying single-crop models.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMPILOT, a specialized encoder-decoder transformer for C++ to OpenMP translation, along with a novel evaluation metric, OMPBLEU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language models struggle with function-level code translation for shared-memory parallelization in OpenMP.

Method: OMPILOT employs custom pre-training objectives incorporating parallel semantics and uses both unsupervised and supervised learning.

Result: OMPILOT improves robustness and accuracy in translating C++ code to OpenMP at the function level.

Conclusion: The approach enhances efficiency in code translation and introduces an innovative metric, OMPBLEU, for evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

TL;DR: This paper explores using AI-driven predictive scaling via Markov Chains to optimize power management in Edge Computing and improve energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With Edge Computing pivotal for real-time applications, managing distributed energy resources efficiently has become key due to power constraints of edge devices.

Method: The paper uses a stochastic modeling approach via Markov Chains, deriving steady-state probabilities and utilizing Monte Carlo simulations for validation.

Result: Results show predictive power scaling improves energy efficiency, responsiveness, and workload distribution across edge nodes, as validated by theoretical and empirical alignment.

Conclusion: AI-driven predictive power management strategies improve state transitions, minimize energy disparities across nodes, and enhance overall system efficiency.

Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but
introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge
devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic
modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in
Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy
consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling
over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model,
showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity
analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power
efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary
transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest
that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy
efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions.
Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload
distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption
disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing
adaptive power coordination in multi-node environments.

*Iker Martín-Álvarez,José I. Aliaga,Maribel Castillo,Sergio Iserte*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for reducing reconfiguration costs in dynamic resource management for high-performance computing (HPC) systems by introducing an efficient parallel spawning strategy, enabling better adaptation to workload with minimized costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and high costs associated with resource reallocation (malleability) in HPC systems, where existing solutions either fail to fully utilize processes or are prohibitively expensive.

Method: The proposed method introduces a novel parallel spawning strategy where all processes cooperate prior to resource redistribution, avoiding the limitations of traditional spawning or resizing mechanisms.

Result: The strategy preserves competitive expansion times with a maximum 1.25x overhead while achieving at least a 20x reduction in shrinkage costs, validated on both homogeneous and heterogeneous HPC systems.

Conclusion: The novel strategy enhances HPC system adaptation to workloads, improving system efficiency and reducing reconfiguration costs, making it applicable to various resource-sharing environments.

Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High
Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource
allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload
makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system
utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of
applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although
beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the
reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,
which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.
Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when
shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across
nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.
This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning
strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,
thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage
limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and
reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times
with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations
that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated
on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in
shared-resource environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes techniques to make large language models (LLMs) efficient on resource-constrained devices by combining dynamic sparsity and low-bit quantization for faster execution without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on edge devices like mobile phones and desktops is vital for privacy, cost efficiency, and responsiveness, but hardware limitations in memory and compute capability make this challenging.

Method: The paper introduces techniques including a zigzag-patterned quantization layout, a specialized GEMV kernel for optimizing computing resources, and a runtime mechanism to process sparse indices efficiently.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput with accuracy similar to dense quantized models across multiple hardware setups and model sizes.

Conclusion: Dynamic sparsity and low-bit quantization can be effectively combined to optimize LLMs for deployment on edge devices, overcoming hardware constraints while retaining performance.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining
importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost.
Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make
efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal
activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,
only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity
could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,
which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained
hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of
techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.
The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes
weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory
locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully
utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that
gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and
hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding
throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,
showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on
commodity GPUs.

*Silvia Bonomi,Giovanni Farina,Roy Friedman,Eviatar B. Procaccia,Sebastien Tixeuil*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new probabilistic model to better address evolving security threats in distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing security threats in distributed systems due to advanced attackers and system vulnerabilities.

Method: A new probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) model integrated into the MAPE-K architecture's Analysis component.

Result: Mathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the relationship between attack spreading rates and self-recovery rates in distributed systems.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers insights into evolving attacks and aids in guiding self-protection and reconfiguration strategies to enhance system resilience.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers
continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire
system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design
phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a
theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be
abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system.
Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it
introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in
reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting
distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a
shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic
Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component.
Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to
drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze
mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes
crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe
state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the
rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the
behavior of the system under such assumptions.

*Petr Kuznetsov,Nathan Josia Schrodt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept called 'dynamic concurrency,' aiming to improve scalability in distributed computing by dynamically addressing synchronization conflicts depending on the current system state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability in distributed computing systems is hindered by synchronization issues caused by conflicting operations on shared data. The authors aim to address this problem by investigating methods to handle conflicts dynamically depending on the system state, as conflicts are often rare and state-dependent.

Method: The authors define the concept of 'dynamic concurrency,' where strong synchronization is employed only when necessary based on the current state. A dynamically concurrent universal construction is then proposed as a solution.

Result: The study establishes the notion of dynamic concurrency and successfully develops a universal construction that adjusts synchronization needs dynamically.

Conclusion: Dynamic concurrency offers an opportunity to minimize unnecessary synchronization, enhancing scalability in distributed computing environments.

Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed
computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization
when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order
in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a
\emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it
is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely
occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic
concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it
\emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system
state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework for network anomaly detection, inspired by brain astrocytic signaling, achieving superior performance over traditional DNNs with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current network anomaly detection frameworks struggle with concept drift, zero-day, and polymorphic attacks due to their offline training models. This creates a need for adaptive, dynamic solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a framework coupling an astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics simulator with a deep neural network. The astrocytic dynamics are modeled using IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and gap junction conductance-aware diffusion.

Result: Testing on CTU-13 (Neris) network data shows the proposed model achieves around 98% accuracy, surpassing traditional DNNs with lower false positives and negatives, and minimal runtime overhead post precomputation.

Conclusion: The Ca$^{2+}$-modulated framework provides an effective, biologically inspired solution for dynamic network anomaly detection and potentially other rapidly-evolving data pattern tasks.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEBA (Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), showcasing its architecture-specific batch size adjustment effectiveness through systematic metrics and performance improvement evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive batch size methods assume a universal strategy that applies equally across all architectures, which may reduce their effectiveness.

Method: DEBA uses gradient variance, gradient norm variation, and loss variation for adaptive batch size adjustments, systematically tested on six architectures using CIFAR datasets.

Result: DEBA enables significant training speedup (up to 62%) and accuracy improvements (up to 7%) for certain architectures, but its benefits depend on the inherent architecture properties.

Conclusion: Adaptive batch size strategies should be architecture-specific, and DEBA provides a methodology for this, challenging the idea that universal adaptation approaches work well across all models.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

Result: The DSRPGO model shows significant improvement in protein function prediction for BPO, MFO, and CCO categories on human datasets compared to benchmark models.

Conclusion: The DSRPGO method enhances multimodal protein function prediction accuracy by effectively mining fine-grained protein information and leveraging feature interactivity and hierarchical classification.

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using federated learning and Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images for privacy-preserving ECG classification in IoT healthcare setups, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance privacy-preserving ECG classification in IoT-based healthcare setups through efficient feature extraction while keeping sensitive data localized.

Method: Transform 1D ECG signals into 2D GAF images for feature extraction via CNNs within a federated learning framework, testing implementation across diverse IoT devices.

Result: Experimental results showed the FL-GAF model achieves 95.18% classification accuracy in multi-client setups while outperforming single-client baselines in accuracy and training time.

Conclusion: The framework proves efficient for scalable and secure edge AI healthcare monitoring, advancing IoT ecosystem deployments with privacy-preserving technologies.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM is a modular multi-agent system designed to create stylistically diverse and contextually aware comments for short-video platforms, leveraging multimodal large language models and explicit style control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating short-video comments that comply with platform guidelines while exhibiting stylistic diversity and contextual relevance.

Method: LOLGORITHM combines video segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction. It uses multimodal large language models for processing video inputs and achieves style control via explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. A bilingual dataset was developed for evaluation covering different genres.

Result: LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube, as verified by both automated metrics and a large-scale human preference study.

Conclusion: LOLGORITHM enhances user engagement and creative interaction on short-video platforms, presenting a scalable and culturally adaptive approach to stylized comment generation.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

### [157] [What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768)
*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal language models excel at single-image perception but struggle with reasoning across scenes, showing significant hallucination issues. Researchers introduce Common-O, a benchmark to test reasoning in real-world scenes, revealing models achieve low accuracy in these tasks despite saturating existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models demonstrate strong perception capabilities but face hallucination issues during real-world scene reasoning. Novel benchmarks are needed to address the gap between existing datasets and real-world cognitive challenges.

Method: This paper introduces the Common-O benchmark, a set of over 10.5k in-the-wild examples using novel images not found in training datasets, with tasks inspired by cognitive human tests. They evaluate leading multimodal models on their ability to answer 'what’s in common?' across scenes, focusing on reasoning ability.

Result: Models show high performance in single-image object recognition but struggle significantly in reasoning across scenes. Even the highest-performing model achieves just 35% on Common-O and only 1% on more complex scenarios in Common-O Complex. Models tend to hallucinate when similar objects co-occur in scenes.

Conclusion: Scaling models and training them with multi-image inputs improve reasoning but does not fully overcome hallucination challenges. The authors encourage future research on multimodal reasoning and make the Common-O benchmark publicly available as a resource.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates test-set leakage in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and proposes a novel detection method using multi-modal semantic perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns rise over inflated performance in VLMs due to test-set leakage caused by the use of unverified large pretraining datasets.

Method: This paper involves deliberate contamination of VLMs on popular benchmarks to test existing detection methods and develops a new detection method based on multi-modal semantic perturbation.

Result: Findings reveal that existing detection methods are insufficient, and the proposed multi-modal semantic perturbation successfully identifies contamination under realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed detection method effectively addresses the issue of test-set leakage for contaminated VLMs, offering robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP offers a two-step framework to improve model utility while preserving privacy for sensitive features in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of excessive noise injection and utility degradation caused by applying differential privacy (DP-SGD) to all features indiscriminately.

Method: FusionDP uses feature imputation with foundation models and a modified DP-SGD algorithm to train models on imputed and original features, ensuring privacy for sensitive features.

Result: FusionDP significantly enhances model performance on sepsis prediction and clinical note classification tasks while maintaining feature-level privacy.

Conclusion: Foundation model-driven imputation demonstrates improved privacy-utility balance for privacy-preserving machine learning across different data modalities.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

### [160] [Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807)
*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops adaptive explanation methods to address concept drift in credit-scoring systems and improve fairness, stability, and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by concept drift in credit-scoring systems that undermine the reliability and fairness of conventional explainability techniques.

Method: Integrated XGBoost predictive modeling with three novel adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice reweighting, (B) sliding-window rebaselining, and (C) online surrogate calibration with Ridge regression.

Result: Adaptive methods improved predictive stability, fairness across demographic groups, and robustness under real-world drift conditions compared to static SHAP explanations.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability enhances transparency, fairness, and ethical reliability in evolving credit models and other decision systems impacted by population shifts and data distribution changes.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a routing approach to assign problems to the smallest capable reasoning model, saving compute while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are expensive to deploy due to their computational demands during extensive reasoning tasks.

Method: Intermediate representations from a large model (s1.1-32B) are used to train predictors that assess problem difficulty or model correctness, directing routing across various reasoning models.

Result: Routing achieves efficiency and matches the large model's performance on math benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is a viable solution for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning language models.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses key limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing randomized global embeddings called 'Sketched Random Features,' which improve GNN performance and solve challenges like oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three major challenges in GNNs: oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressive power, which hinder GNNs' ability to capture long-range dependencies in graph-structured data.

Method: The authors propose injecting 'Sketched Random Features,' which are randomized global embeddings of node features into standard GNN models. These embeddings are designed to be unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic.

Result: The introduction of Sketched Random Features significantly enhances GNN performance across real-world graph learning tasks and serves as both an independent solution and a complementary enhancement to other methods like graph positional encodings.

Conclusion: Incorporating Sketched Random Features into GNNs effectively addresses their inherent limitations, providing an improved framework for learning on graph-structured data while maintaining compatibility with existing techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces StratDiff, a method to address distributional shifts in transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional shifts between offline datasets and evolving policies during online learning present critical challenges, and existing methods lack a stratified approach to utilize offline data effectively.

Method: StratDiff utilizes a diffusion model to learn offline data priors, refines this with energy-based functions, and stratifies training into offline-like and online-like samples for tailored learning strategies.

Result: StratDiff exhibits superior adaptability and stability compared to existing methods in D4RL benchmarks, particularly when integrated with Cal-QL and IQL.

Conclusion: StratDiff enables smoother offline-to-online transitions in RL, offering performance improvements by leveraging stratified training based on distributional structures of offline data.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an extension of the causal additive model (CAM) to account for higher-order interactions using hypergraphs, providing theoretical insights, identifiability results, and empirical evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explicit treatment of higher-order interactions in causal discovery frameworks, which are important in many real-world processes.

Method: The paper focuses on extending CAM to include higher-order interactions using directed acyclic hypergraphs (hyper DAGs), introduces theoretical tools for handling this structure, and develops an extension of the greedy CAM algorithm for better structure learning.

Result: Providing identifiability results for hyper DAGs, insights into learning efficiency and accuracy, and demonstrating improved empirical outcomes in synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: Higher-order interactions can enhance causal discovery models, with hyper DAGs providing an effective framework and improved algorithmic approaches yielding experimental success.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SADQ, a modification to DQNs, addressing unstable learning by integrating successor-state distributions into Q-value estimation and improving policy alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high variance and inefficiency in DQNs caused by reliance on suboptimal policy transitions and poorly aligned sampled transitions.

Method: The authors propose SADQ, combining a stochastic transition model and successor-state distributions into Q-value estimation, with a novel action selection strategy to reduce variance and improve training efficiency.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are provided for unbiased value estimation and variance reduction. Empirical results from RL benchmarks and real-world tasks show that SADQ outperforms standard DQN variants in stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: SADQ effectively enhances DQN by reducing variance, improving stability, and aligning value updates more closely with the agent's current policy, demonstrating superiority in learning efficiency and performance across tasks.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF), a unified forecasting problem addressing temporally shifted outcome channels based on early usage channels, using benchmark datasets from platforms like arXiv and GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to formalize and systematically explore the ubiquitous but understudied phenomenon where early interactions on platforms correlate with long-term impact, with a lack of standardized datasets being a key bottleneck.

Method: To address the gap, the authors curated high-volume benchmark datasets from various domains, verified lead-lag dynamics, and evaluated forecasting approaches using statistical and machine learning baselines.

Result: They provided two large-scale datasets capturing lead-lag dynamics over years, examined statistical patterns, tested various baseline models, and demonstrated the viability of LLF as a forecasting approach.

Conclusion: The paper positions LLF as a distinct forecasting paradigm and provides datasets and documentation to facilitate further research in this area across diverse domains.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a score-based methodology for detecting abrupt changes in Markov process dynamics without explicitly calculating likelihoods, enabling efficient detection in high-dimensional settings with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quick detection of changes in Markov processes is crucial for applications involving dynamic systems or high-dimensional data, but traditional methods relying on likelihood evaluation are computationally challenging.

Method: The authors propose learning conditional score $
abla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ from data pairs $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$, and applying it in a score-based CUSUM procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences and a truncated statistic to detect changes.

Result: They prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarms and asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay, demonstrating theoretical guarantees. The approach provides practical feasibility for detecting changes in high-dimensional Markov models.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a computationally efficient and theoretically backed way to detect changes in high-dimensional Markov processes, avoiding the drawbacks of explicit likelihood modeling.

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecoHD, a compressed hyperdimensional computing technique, achieves extreme memory savings, robustness, and hardware efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrink deep networks without affecting input/output and address issues in hyperdimensional computing where reduction affects feature axis eroding robustness.

Method: DecoHD uses a decomposed HDC parameterization with per-layer channels, multiplicative binding, lightweight bundling heads, preserving bind-bundle-score, and end-to-end training.

Result: DecoHD achieves memory savings with minimal accuracy loss (~0.1-0.15% on average compared to baseline), enhanced robustness, and significant hardware efficiency gains (energy/speed).

Conclusion: DecoHD offers an effective compression method for hyperdimensional computing, aligning with hardware accelerators while maintaining high performance and robustness.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the impact of higher-order optimization methods, specifically stochastic Gauss-Newton method (SGN), on training deep neural networks and generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how optimization methods like SGN influence generalization in deep learning and identify favorable conditions for their effectiveness.

Method: Analyzes the SGN method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling, providing finite-time convergence bounds and non-asymptotic generalization bounds using uniform stability.

Result: Finds favorable generalization conditions for SGN, highlighting the role of curvature, batch size, and network overparameterization in performance.

Conclusion: SGN exhibits advantage in generalization under specific conditions, especially when the minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along the optimization path is larger, enabling tighter stability bounds.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

*Ekin Uğurel,Cynthia Chen,Brian H. Y. Lee,Filipe Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve the inference of sociodemographic attributes through mobility data by introducing structured mobility features, tools for model uncertainty, and a multitask learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in accurately inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data due to weak, inconsistent relationships and limited generalization across contexts.

Method: The study introduces higher-order mobility descriptors, diagnostic tools for uncertainty evaluation, and a multitask learning framework for efficient generalization and shared learning.

Result: Performance improvements are seen in predicting sociodemographic traits, especially age, gender, income, and household structure, with better generalization across time and limited data conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies enhance the predictive power, interpretability, and reliability of sociodemographic data inferred from mobility patterns, while also bolstering generalization and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Method: The authors developed a process to synthetically generate near-optimal decision trees as large-scale pre-training data and used the MetaTree transformer architecture for training.

Result: The method achieves similar performance to pre-training with real-world data or optimal decision trees, while reducing computational costs and increasing flexibility in data generation.

Conclusion: This approach advances scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree models, with significant computational and flexibility benefits.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and
healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient,
scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable

trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the
MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited real-world data availability due to costs or privacy issues through effective synthetic data selection.

Method: Proposes SynQuE, introducing proxy metrics adapted from embedding models and large language model reasoning (LENS) to rank synthetic datasets.

Result: SynQuE proxies correlated with improved task performance across varied tasks; notably, LENS showed strong results in complex tasks.

Conclusion: SynQuE is established as a practical framework for synthetic data selection, enhancing real-world task performance and paving the way for future research in data characterization and selection.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving deep ensemble predictive performance and uncertainty quantification using joint optimization techniques.

Method: Joint tuning of weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping. Proposed a partially overlapping holdout strategy to balance training data usage and joint model evaluation.

Result: Joint tuning generally enhances performance and uncertainty calibration, though impact varies by task and metric. Overlapping holdout strategy is practical and effective.

Conclusion: Joint optimization shows promising improvements for deep ensembles and offers guidance to practitioners in balancing training trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ForecastGAN is a novel adversarial framework for enhanced multi-horizon time series forecasting, outperforming existing models in short-term predictions while remaining competitive in long-term scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for time series forecasting, particularly transformer-based ones, perform well for long-term predictions but struggle in short-term scenarios and generally overlook categorical features.

Method: ForecastGAN integrates three modules: Decomposition for extracting trend and seasonality, Model Selection for optimized neural network configurations, and Adversarial Training using Conditional GANs to improve robustness and accuracy.

Result: ForecastGAN consistently outperforms transformer-based models in short-term forecasting and remains competitive for long-term predictions across eleven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ForecastGAN presents a generalizable and adaptive approach to time series forecasting, effectively handling both numerical and categorical features without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogHD, a method for hyperdimensional computing that reduces memory requirements and increases robustness by replacing class prototypes with a logarithmic approach using bundle hypervectors, achieving improved accuracy, resilience, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving memory, energy efficiency, and robustness in hyperdimensional computing systems without compromising performance.

Method: LogHD employs logarithmic reduction in the class axis by using bundle hypervectors with a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, preserving dimensionality while reducing memory footprint.

Result: LogHD achieves competitive accuracy, higher resilience, and substantial energy and speedup over traditional methods, with significant efficiency improvements on ASIC instantiations compared to high-end CPUs, GPUs, and feature-axis compressed HDC methods.

Conclusion: LogHD offers an effective method for high-performance and robust hyperdimensional computing with greater efficiency in memory use, energy consumption, and computational speed.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to benchmark the performance of an innovative Gaussian Process-based surrogate (B-EPGP) model against classical numerical simulation methods for wave equations, addressing the need for accurate and efficient solutions.

Method: The B-EPGP approach uses exponential-polynomial bases to exactly enforce the PDE and boundary conditions, combined with penalized least squares for coefficient estimation. It employs a DoF matching protocol to ensure fairness in comparison to CN-FEM with Crank-Nicolson time stepping.

Result: B-EPGP achieves lower space-time $L^2$ error and maximum-in-time $L^2$ error compared to CN-FEM, offering a roughly two orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy under matched degrees-of-freedom conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the superiority of the B-EPGP model over traditional methods, indicating its potential for enhanced accuracy in wave equation solutions.

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing assertions of the 'right to be forgotten' require CD models to support user data removal effectively while preserving model utility and efficiency.

Method: The proposed hierarchical importance-guided forgetting (HIF) algorithm utilizes parameter importance with distinct layer-wise characteristics to precisely modify parameters associated with data to be unlearned.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HIF significantly outperforms existing baselines in unlearning completeness, utility, and efficiency.

Conclusion: HIF offers the first systematic and effective solution for CD models to integrate privacy-preserving functionalities through efficient data unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of forgetting in general learning algorithms, which hinders their ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new data.

Method: The authors propose a task-independent and algorithm-agnostic theory of forgetting based on the predictive information loss, alongside experiments validating the concept across diverse learning settings.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that forgetting is a fundamental characteristic of learning algorithms, influencing learning efficiency across classification, regression, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a principled understanding of forgetting, laying groundwork for enhancing information retention in learning algorithms.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PETRA, a transformer model based on phylogenetic evolutionary trajectories, addressing challenges in SARS-CoV-2 mutation prediction more effectively than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2's immune-evasive evolution, where traditional approaches struggle due to noisy viral sequences and imbalances in global data distribution.

Method: The authors developed PETRA, a novel approach using evolutionary trajectories from phylogenetic trees instead of raw RNA sequences. The method utilizes a weighted training framework to tackle geographical and temporal biases within sequence data.

Result: PETRA significantly outperformed baseline models, achieving higher weighted recall levels for predicting SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide and spike amino-acid mutations. It also showcased real-time mutation prediction capabilities for major clades.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PETRA's innovative use of evolutionary trajectories and weighted training frameworks make it a superior tool for mutation forecasting, opening new avenues for pandemic response and vaccine development.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained models struggle with high computational costs and structural instability during multi-task adaptations, prompting the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: The paper introduces composable fine-tuning using graph structural priors and modular adapters through a relation matrix for task dependencies. It employs low-rank mapping, pluggable adapter mechanisms, and structural constraints for efficient weight allocation and path optimization.

Result: Experiments show improvements in task prediction accuracy, adapter allocation precision, and computational efficiency under structural constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances performance and efficiency while maintaining a lightweight design, demonstrating the benefits of integrating graph priors and modular adapters for fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Result: TwIST achieves competitive perplexity compared to state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods, particularly excelling under aggressive sparsity levels (e.g., 50%+), with practical inference speedups and memory savings.

Conclusion: TwIST demonstrates that sparsified large language models can be produced efficiently during training without requiring additional post-training procedures, enabling hardware-friendly deployment.

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

### [184] [Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring with Machine Learning to Identify Metabolic Subphenotypes and Inform Precision Lifestyle Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03986)
*Ahmed A. Metwally,Heyjun Park,Yue Wu,Tracey McLaughlin,Michael P. Snyder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews the potential of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and wearable technologies to shift diabetes diagnosis and management toward personalized, data-driven approaches by identifying unique metabolic subtypes and enabling precision interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional glucose thresholds for classifying diabetes and prediabetes fail to account for underlying metabolic variability caused by factors like insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency.

Method: The study utilizes CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance tests, machine learning models with high-resolution glucose data, and wearable technology to identify metabolic subtypes and the impact of factors such as diet, sleep, and physical activity on glycemic responses.

Result: Machine learning effectively predicts measures of metabolic dysfunction, and wearable data links lifestyle patterns with specific metabolic issues. CGM reveals distinctive postprandial glycemic responses and phenotype-dependent efficacy of dietary interventions.

Conclusion: This research showcases the ability to use CGM and integrated wearable data for personalized metabolic phenotyping, allowing for targeted prevention and treatment strategies that address the individual core metabolic defects of diabetes and prediabetes patients.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

*Mingyu Sung,Vikas Palakonda,Suhwan Im,Sunghwan Moon,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an autoregressive-aware split computing framework enabling efficient deployment of large language models on edge devices by addressing memory and latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices due to large parameter footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding.

Method: The framework introduces one-point split compression for mixed-precision quantization, a two-stage intermediate compression pipeline for reducing communication overhead, and a unified optimization model for selecting optimal configurations.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates improved inference speed (1.49x speedup), reduced communication overhead, and maintained or enhanced model accuracy across different LLMs and hardware platforms.

Conclusion: This work successfully presents an optimized solution to deploy LLMs effectively in edge computing scenarios, advancing prior quantization methodologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

*Yuantian Shao,Yuanteng Chen,Peisong Wang,Jianlin Yu,Jing Lin,Yiwu Yao,Zhihui Wei,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DartQuant, a rotational optimization method for efficient model quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs and overfitting associated with fine-tuning rotational optimization algorithms for large-scale model quantization.

Method: DartQuant employs distribution-aware rotational calibration and QR-Orth optimization to improve efficiency and performance in model quantization.

Result: DartQuant achieves 47x acceleration and 10x memory savings compared to existing methods, and successfully quantizes a 70B model using a single 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: DartQuant makes it feasible to perform efficient quantization of large-scale models in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

### [188] [Learning Filter-Aware Distance Metrics for Nearest Neighbor Search with Multiple Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04073)
*Ananya Sutradhar,Suryansh Gupta,Ravishankar Krishnaswamy,Haiyang Xu,Aseem Rastogi,Gopal Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new graph-based approach for filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search by learning the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly from the data, improving search accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for filtered ANN search rely on fixed penalties that fail to generalize across diverse datasets, making them less efficient and reliable.

Method: The paper introduces a data-driven approach to adapt the distance function using constrained linear optimization to derive weights based on the filter's distribution. These weights guide both the search process and index construction.

Result: The proposed method improves accuracy by 5-10% compared to existing fixed-penalty methods, especially on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Learning weights directly from data yields a more flexible and effective approach for filtered ANN search, optimizing both search accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

### [189] [DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086)
*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeNoise, a novel framework tailored for unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) in noisy, graph-structured datasets. It focuses on learning robust graph embeddings under contaminated conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need to enhance UGAD methods, as current Graph Neural Network-based approaches assume a clean training dataset, which rarely occurs in real-world scenarios where graph data is often noisy or contaminated by anomalous instances.

Method: DeNoise employs a joint optimization of a graph-level encoder, attribute decoder, and structure decoder using an adversarial objective. The framework incorporates an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism and a contrastive learning approach to improve representation quality, suppress anomaly interference, and handle noise.

Result: Through experiments on eight real-world datasets, DeNoise demonstrates consistent robustness to noise, better representation learning, and outperformance of current UGAD techniques across different contamination levels.

Conclusion: DeNoise provides a reliable solution for UGAD under noisy conditions, showcasing state-of-the-art results by addressing the challenge of contaminated training data with innovative mechanisms for denoising and embedding quality improvement.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

*Hyungjong Na,Wonho Song,Seungyong Han,Donghyeon Jo,Sejin Myung,Hyungjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a unique dataset for studying corporate tax avoidance in non-financial Korean firms listed between 2011 and 2024. The dataset includes 12,653 firm-year observations and accounts for tax avoidance indicators while linking them to various business domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized, comprehensive dataset (KoTaP) that addresses gaps in analyzing corporate tax avoidance while incorporating unique institutional features of Korean firms and ensuring international comparability.

Method: The dataset is constructed by excluding certain categories (e.g., financial firms, non-December fiscal year ends) and measuring tax avoidance through specific indicators (CETR, GETR, book-tax differences). Variables are standardized and balanced for comparability and linking to multiple domains.

Result: KoTaP ensures consistency with international literature and highlights unique Korean firm characteristics such as concentrated ownership and high foreign shareholding. It facilitates econometric, AI benchmarking, policy analysis, audit planning, and more.

Conclusion: KoTaP serves as a critical resource for multi-disciplinary research, combining international comparability with insights specific to Korean firms. It offers robust tools for exploring tax avoidance and its impact across various domains.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

### [191] [Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04124)
*Giorgio Morales,John W. Sheppard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a symbolic regression (SR) method to discover interpretable mathematical expressions using transformers, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming, aiming for better equation identification than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most symbolic regression methods prioritize minimizing prediction error instead of discovering accurate governing equations, often resulting in overly complex or incorrect expressions.

Method: The proposed method uses a Multi-Set Transformer to generate symbolic structures, evaluates them using genetic algorithms, and combines them via genetic programming to produce interpretable multivariate skeletons, followed by coefficient optimization.

Result: The method demonstrated lower or comparable error rates for interpolation and extrapolation compared to existing approaches, and could consistently learn expressions aligned with original mathematical structures.

Conclusion: This decomposable SR approach improves interpretability and equation discovery, advancing accuracy and consistency in modeling complex systems.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

*Hongbin Zhang,Shihao Gao,Yang Liu,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as end-to-end compilers, using a dedicated evaluation framework called CompilerEval. Although LLMs show basic capabilities, they currently struggle with high-quality assembly code generation. Optimizations and future advancements could enable effective compiler solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) as end-to-end compilers and propose viable directions for advancing their capabilities in transforming source code into assembly code.

Method: The authors designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework to evaluate LLMs in tasks such as source code comprehension, assembly code generation, error analysis, and cross-platform compilation methods.

Result: Experimental findings indicate that while LLMs show basic compiler capabilities, their compilation success rate remains low. Prompt optimization, scaling models, and reasoning techniques show promise for notable improvements.

Conclusion: With targeted training, improved prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LLM-based compilers could usher in a paradigm shift in system software, achieving high-quality assembly code generation and transforming the field.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

*Jiaming Zhang,Yujie Yang,Haoning Wang,Liping Zhang,Shengbo Eben Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Exchange Policy Optimization (EPO) framework for semi-infinite safe reinforcement learning (SI-safe RL) to balance long-term performance with safety constraints across a continuous parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe RL needs to address infinite constraints arising in practical applications, where safety must be enforced across a continuous domain.

Method: EPO iteratively solves safe RL subproblems by dynamically managing constraints, adding violated ones and removing redundant ones, ensuring deterministic safety and controlled working set growth.

Result: EPO-trained strategies perform similarly to optimal solutions while keeping global constraint violations within a defined safety tolerance.

Conclusion: The proposed EPO framework effectively resolves SI-safe RL challenges, guarantees bounded safety, and achieves optimal performance under given constraints.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer learning to address trajectory data scarcity at regional and secondary airports, adapting generative models to generate synthetic data for Air Traffic Management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome severe trajectory data scarcity at secondary and regional airports, which hampers the use of machine learning methods and large-scale simulations for Air Traffic Management.

Method: Generative models, specifically diffusion-based and flow-matching-based architectures, are pretrained on abundant data from Zurich Airport and fine-tuned on scarce data from Dublin Airport with varying percentages of local data.

Result: Diffusion-based models can achieve competitive performance with minimal local data (as little as 5%) and reach baseline performance with 20%, outperforming models trained from scratch. Latent diffusion and flow matching show variable gains, while flow matching models generalize less effectively.

Conclusion: Transfer learning holds promise for reducing trajectory data needs in Air Traffic Management, enabling realistic synthetic data generation even for airports with limited historical data.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

*Anzhuo Xie,Wei-Chen Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Transformer-based method for clinical risk classification using heterogeneous EHR data, addressing challenges like irregular timings, modality differences, and complex semantic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in analyzing EHR data, including irregular temporal patterns, large modality differences, and complex semantic structures, to improve clinical risk classification.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-source feature embedding, learnable temporal encoding, and a multi-head self-attention structure for modeling global dependencies and semantic-weighted pooling for key event importance.

Result: The model achieved superior performance in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score compared to traditional and deep learning methods, enhancing clinical risk identification.

Conclusion: This method provides an efficient, accurate, and reliable tool for intelligent clinical decision-making in heterogeneous multi-source EHR environments.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDL, a framework for runtime prediction in DNN models, combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling and graph neural networks for enhanced accuracy and generalizability, while reducing data collection costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need for accurate runtime predictions in deep neural networks (DNNs), especially as their complexity increases. Traditional methods either lack accuracy or incur high data collection costs, motivating the need for innovative solutions.

Method: ScaleDL integrates nonlinear layer-wise modeling with a graph neural network-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, combined with the D-optimal method to minimize data collection costs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ScaleDL achieves 6× lower mean relative error (MRE) and 5× lower root mean square error (RMSE) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ScaleDL effectively balances prediction accuracy, generalizability, and cost-efficiency, marking significant progress in runtime prediction for DNN workloads.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

Motivation: The growing scale of large language models (LLMs) demands solutions to reduce prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers potential for efficient deployment, but accurate quantization remains challenging, particularly under new formats like MXFP4.

Method: The authors benchmark existing PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format, systematically evaluating their performance. They analyze the root cause of incompatibility for rotation-based approaches and propose a novel block rotation strategy tailored to the MXFP4 format.

Result: The systematic evaluation reveals that GPTQ performs well under MXFP4, while rotation-based approaches face incompatibility. The proposed block rotation strategy resolves these issues, significantly improving accuracy for various LLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of existing PTQ methods for the MXFP4 format and introduces a solution with practical improvements in accuracy. It sets a foundation for further research in utilizing emerging low-precision formats efficiently.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

### [198] [The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04217)
*Hikari Otsuka,Daiki Chijiwa,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Daichi Fujiki,Susumu Takeuchi,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) in the context of transformer architectures, specifically focusing on multi-head attention mechanisms (MHA). The authors present theoretical proofs and empirical validations, demonstrating the existence of strong lottery tickets in MHAs and transformers without normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to bridge the gap in the theoretical understanding of the strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) for transformer architectures, particularly addressing the role of multi-head attention (MHA) mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce a theoretical analysis proving that randomly initialized MHAs with certain hidden dimension configurations contain strong lottery tickets that approximate an arbitrary MHA with a high probability. They extend this theory to transformers without normalization layers and validate their findings empirically.

Result: The paper reveals that the approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer) and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially as the hidden dimension of the source model increases. These results provide theoretical understanding and empirical evidence for SLTs in MHAs and transformers.

Conclusion: The research establishes the theoretical basis of the SLTH for transformer architectures, particularly for multi-head attention mechanisms. It demonstrates that high-performing subnetworks can be reliably identified in randomly initialized MHAs and transformers under certain conditions, providing valuable insights into the design and optimization of neural networks.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

*Rasmus Møller-Larsen,Adam Izdebski,Jan Olszewski,Pankhil Gawade,Michal Kmicikiewicz,Wojciech Zarzecki,Ewa Szczurek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of seqme, a Python library for evaluating computational biological sequence design methods, focusing on flexible metrics and wide applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in evaluating computational methods for designing biological sequences due to a lack of a unified software library for performance metrics.

Method: Development of seqme, an open-source modular Python library with model-agnostic metrics grouped as sequence-based, embedding-based, and property-based measures.

Result: seqme supports evaluation of various biological sequences and design methods, incorporating property models, diagnostics, and visualization tools.

Conclusion: seqme addresses the gap in performance evaluation tools for biological sequence design, facilitating broader adoption and efficient method analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

*Irene Ferfoglia,Simone Silvetti,Gaia Saveri,Laura Nenzi,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STELLE, a neuro-symbolic framework for time series classification, enabling both accuracy and human-readable explanations through temporal logic embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for time series classification are often black-box models, making their reasoning difficult to comprehend, particularly in safety-critical applications.

Method: STELLE embeds time series data into a space of logical concepts using a novel Signal Temporal Logic (STL)-inspired kernel to align raw time series with predefined STL formulae.

Result: STELLE demonstrates competitive accuracy and generates explanations as human-readable STL conditions for both individual predictions and general class characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines classification accuracy with interpretability, making it suitable for real-world applications needing clear and faithful explanations.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

*Matteo Cercola,Valeria Capretti,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining RLHF's scalability with PBO's query efficiency to enable efficient learning from human preferences, validated through experiments on preference optimization and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and high cost of collecting human preference data for model alignment, combining RLHF's scalability and PBO's sample efficiency for better learning paradigms.

Method: The proposed approach integrates PBO's acquisition-driven module into RLHF's pipeline, creating a hybrid framework for active and sample-efficient preference gathering.

Result: Experiments showed improved sample efficiency and overall task performance in high-dimensional preference optimization and LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Integrating RLHF with PBO enhances preference learning efficiency and performance, providing a promising hybrid approach for human-centered machine learning alignment tasks.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

*Antti Koskela,Tejas Kulkarni,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) that integrates privacy-aware nearest neighbor search for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in in-context learning, focusing on improving nearest neighbor search in LLM pipelines.

Method: The method combines nearest neighbor retrieval from context databases with a privacy filter that tracks cumulative privacy costs to adhere to a differential privacy budget.

Result: Outperforms baselines across benchmarks with better privacy-utility trade-offs, demonstrated on text classification and document question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed DP framework enhances privacy and utility in in-context learning, addressing critical gaps in LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

### [203] [LUME-DBN: Full Bayesian Learning of DBNs from Incomplete data in Intensive Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04333)
*Federico Pirola,Fabio Stella,Marco Grzegorczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Gibbs sampling-based method for handling missing data in Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to better model temporal relationships in healthcare datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for handling missing data in longitudinal clinical datasets inadequately account for temporal dynamics, reducing model reliability and trust in scenarios like intensive care.

Method: Proposed a Gibbs sampling-based method to handle missing data by treating each missing value as an unknown Gaussian parameter, iteratively sampled from its full conditional distribution.

Result: The Bayesian approach improved reconstruction accuracy and convergence compared to standard techniques like MICE, validated through simulated and real-world intensive care data.

Conclusion: Incorporating full Bayesian inference enhances reliability and clinical relevance of DBNs, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in environments with frequent missing data, such as critical care.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

*Subeen Park,Joowang Kim,Hakyung Lee,Sunjae Yoo,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents SCER, a method that reduces spurious correlations in deep learning models to improve worst-group robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations, struggling particularly with underrepresented groups during distribution shifts.

Method: The proposed SCER approach regularizes feature representations, using theoretical constraints, to focus on core features instead of spurious patterns.

Result: SCER demonstrates improved worst-group accuracy over state-of-the-art methods through systematic evaluation across multiple vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: SCER mitigates the influence of spurious correlations, offering a theoretically sound and empirically effective solution to enhance worst-group robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on how current uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform under ambiguous real-world language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the gap in accurate uncertainty quantification for LLMs, as existing methods perform poorly when ambiguity is present in real-world data.

Method: The paper introduces ambiguous QA datasets called MAQA* and AmbigQA* with ground-truth answer distributions and evaluates the performance of various UQ estimation paradigms under ambiguous conditions.

Result: Current UQ methods for LLMs perform well in ambiguity-free settings but fail significantly on ambiguous data, regardless of the estimation paradigm used.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical limitation in existing UQ methodologies for LLMs and suggests a need to rethink modeling paradigms to better handle ambiguity.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

*Jayadeva,Naman Dwivedi,Hari Krishnan,N. M. Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal equivalence between regression and classification, proposing a new perspective on regression and developing tools like a "regressability" measure and enhanced neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a direct theoretical connection between regression and classification tasks and propose alternate regression formulations.

Method: The authors draw an equivalence between a regression problem with $M$ samples and a classification problem with $2M$ samples, using margin maximization principles to reformulate regression and introduce tools like a "regressability" measure and neural network transformations.

Result: The study introduces an alternate regression formulation, a predictive regressability measure to gauge regression difficulty, and a method to train neural networks to linearize datasets for easier regression.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a novel theoretical framework linking regression and classification, along with practical tools to evaluate and improve regression tasks.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two algorithms for federated minimax optimization under heavy-tailed noise, demonstrating novel theoretical guarantees and validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of nonconvex stochastic optimization under more realistic assumptions of heavy-tailed noise, particularly in the federated learning context.

Method: The authors developed two algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M (using normalized gradients) and FedMuon-DA (using Muon optimizer for local updates) to handle heavy-tailed noises under nonconvex-PL minimax optimization.

Result: Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$, marking them as the first algorithms with theoretical guarantees for such scenarios.

Conclusion: Fed-NSGDA-M and FedMuon-DA are effective solutions to tackle heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new model, TNCM-VAE, that combines causal reasoning with time-series data generation for financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models for financial data lack causal reasoning, which is essential for tasks like counterfactual analysis and risk assessment.

Method: The authors developed TNCM-VAE, which integrates variational autoencoders and structural causal models, enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs, and uses causal Wasserstein distance for training.

Result: Validation on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process showed that TNCM-VAE achieves superior counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances of 0.03-0.10 compared to the ground truth.

Conclusion: TNCM-VAE facilitates financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and backtesting by generating counterfactual market trajectories that respect causal relationships in time-series data.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the factual accuracy of LLMs by retrieving information from graph-structured knowledge bases, overcoming the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.

Method: SynthKGQA generates synthetic QA datasets from knowledge graphs, enabling evaluation and training of KG retrievers with complete ground-truth data. It was applied to Wikidata to create the GTSQA dataset.

Result: The GTSQA dataset tests zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with unseen graph structures and relation types, allowing comprehensive benchmarking of KG-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: SynthKGQA improves benchmarking and training of Knowledge Graph retrievers, advancing the development of KG-augmented language models.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

*Ipsita Ghosh,Ethan Nguyen,Christian Kümmerle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel technique called Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer (Q3R) to tackle low-rank pre-training challenges in deep learning, achieving high performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient training works well for fine-tuning large models but struggles with low-rank pre-training, where maintaining the rank structure is difficult.

Method: The proposed method, Q3R, employs a quadratic regularizer inspired by iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) to maintain low-rank weight matrices with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Q3R enables the training of models with significantly reduced parameters while maintaining competitive performance. For example, truncating 60% and 80% of parameters in a ViT-Tiny model resulted in only 1.3% and 4% accuracy drops on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Q3R is an effective, architecture-compatible strategy for low-rank training and fine-tuning of neural networks, reducing parameter usage with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

*Alper Kalle,Theo Rudkiewicz,Mohamed-Oumar Ouerfelli,Mohamed Tamaazousti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for compressing neural networks using tensorization and low-rank representations based on data-informed norms, improving accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks, commonly used for image tasks, require significant computing power. Compression post-training can reduce hardware requirements and improve efficiency.

Method: This work introduces compression techniques based on tensor decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD), optimizing layer output distribution error using data-informed norms derived from the covariance matrix.

Result: The method achieves competitive accuracy without requiring post-compression fine-tuning and allows for dataset transferability with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed compression method offers efficient neural network compression that maintains accuracy, reduces hardware demands, and demonstrates flexibility across different datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

### [212] [Alternative Fairness and Accuracy Optimization in Criminal Justice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04505)
*Shaolong Wu,James Blume,Geshi Yeung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates algorithmic fairness in criminal justice, proposing a modified group fairness approach. This reduces error differences while enhancing accuracy and offering ethical error-cost solutions. A framework is suggested for practical deployment in public systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing unsettled key concepts of algorithmic fairness in criminal justice to create ethical solutions that improve fairness and predictive accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes altering standard group fairness by minimizing weighted error loss and keeping false negative rates within a specified tolerance. Conditions for fairness conflicts were also mapped.

Result: The modified approach improves predictive accuracy, eases solution implementation, and introduces ethical error-cost considerations.

Conclusion: A practical deployment framework is proposed. It links technical designs to legitimacy and offers actionable guidance for agencies integrating fairness-oriented tools.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related

### [213] [Linear Mode Connectivity under Data Shifts for Deep Ensembles of Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04514)
*C. Hepburn,T. Zielke,A. P. Raulf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) in deep learning, focusing on its behavior under data shifts and proposing methods to mitigate impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects and mechanisms of linear mode connectivity in deep learning, especially in response to data shifts and their implications for stability, generalization, and model ensembles.

Method: Experimental studies analyzing LMC behavior under data shifts. Data shifts are treated as stochastic gradient noise, with learning strategies such as small learning rates and large batch sizes employed to mitigate impacts.

Result: Findings show that models affected by LMC tend to make similar errors due to converging towards the same local minima or regions with varying smoothness and generalization. Balancing training efficiency and ensemble diversity is key.

Conclusion: LMC offers a compromise between training efficiency and achieving benefits from larger, diverse ensembles, providing insights into architectural effects and stochastic gradient noise mitigation approaches in deep learning.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

*Daniel Mayfrank,Kayra Dernek,Laura Lang,Alexander Mitsos,Manuel Dahmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning-based method for training Koopman surrogate models in nonlinear model predictive control applications and demonstrates its scalability to larger systems with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance and scalability of Koopman surrogate models in nonlinear model predictive control, especially for practical economic and constraint-handling applications.

Method: The authors employ a reinforcement learning-based training approach for Koopman surrogate models and demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale demand response case study of a nitrogen air separation unit.

Result: The proposed method achieved comparable economic performance to traditional system identification-based approaches while eliminating instances of constraint violations.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based Koopman surrogate modeling is viable for scalable, constraint-aware, and economically efficient nonlinear model predictive control applications.

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

*Jonas E. Katona,Emily K. de Jong,Nipun Gunawardena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study presents a framework for uncertainty quantification in reduced-order models (ROMs), applied to latent space models for physical systems, without needing architecture or training changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ROMs effectively simulate high-dimensional physical systems but lack a generalizable approach for uncertainty quantification. Existing methods are architecture- or training-specific, limiting their usability and flexibility.

Method: A model-agnostic and post hoc framework using conformal prediction is introduced, which provides statistical prediction intervals for various components of the ROM pipeline.

Result: The framework demonstrates high accuracy in predicting latent space dynamics and evaluating uncertainties in a cloud microphysics model.

Conclusion: This approach enables effective predictive uncertainty quantification for ROMs, offering flexibility and adaptability without altering the architecture or training process.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

### [216] [Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557)
*Divyansha Lachi,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Vinam Arora,Tom Palczewski,Eva L. Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), which combines spatial and temporal data dependencies within relational graphs for improved multi-task prediction across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph models primarily focus on spatial relationships and single-task prediction, ignoring the modeling potential of temporal data in relational systems.

Method: The authors propose a temporal subgraph sampler to capture temporally relevant relationships and introduce the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture leveraging cross-attention latent bottlenecks for spatial-temporal integrations with multi-task capabilities.

Result: Experimental evaluation on benchmarks like RelBench, SALT, and CTU shows RGP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse predictive tasks.

Conclusion: RGP provides a general, scalable model for relational deep learning, effectively integrating spatial and temporal dynamics for varied prediction tasks in complex domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

*Vasco V. Branco,Jandó Benedek,Lidia Pivovarova,Luís Correia,Pedro Cardoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The ARETE R package automates extraction and validation of species occurrence data using large language models, enhancing conservation efforts and spatial planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of lack of key species occurrence data crucial for conservation efforts, exacerbated by the rapid pace of data generation due to human activities.

Method: The ARETE R package employs a systematic workflow powered by large language models, integrating Optical Character Recognition, detection of outliers, and tabular data output.

Result: The analysis validates ARETE, showcasing its ability to discover species occurrence data, significantly expanding known ranges and aiding spatial conservation planning.

Conclusion: ARETE is a promising tool for automated access to essential species occurrence data, allowing researchers to focus resources efficiently and incorporate bibliographic predictions for projects.

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

*Oshri Naparstek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Complexity as Advantage" (CAA), a framework defining system complexity based on observer predictive regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a framework that grounds complexity as a functional value through differentiated predictive regret across observers.

Method: The authors evaluate complexity relative to observers by analyzing predictive regret, and unify existing concepts of emergent behavior through their framework.

Result: CAA links predictive regret to observer-dependent complexity, demonstrated through dynamical models and generalized notions of emergent behavior.

Conclusion: Complex systems, inducing differentiated regret across observers, are considered 'advantageous,' with implications for understanding learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

### [219] [Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594)
*Utkarsh U. Chavan,Prashant Trivedi,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses decentralized multi-agent systems for stochastic shortest path problems using linear function approximation. It establishes a regret lower bound that characterizes the learning difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path problems, emphasizing the inherent complexity in learning efficient decentralized control policies.

Method: Utilizes symmetry-based arguments to identify optimal policies' structure and constructs hard-to-learn instances to establish regret lower bounds.

Result: Provided the first regret lower bound of Ω(√K) for decentralized multi-agent SSPs, revealing learning challenges.

Conclusion: The study enhances the understanding of learning complexities in decentralized control, aiding in the development of efficient learning algorithms for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

*Hampus Åström,Elin Anna Topp,Jacek Malec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transforming reinforcement learning environments into goal-conditioned contexts to allow agents to learn autonomously and without external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous and reward-free task solving in reinforcement learning by creating a framework where agents set and pursue their own goals.

Method: A method that transforms reinforcement learning environments to goal-conditioned settings, allowing agents to independently select goals in an environment-agnostic way, independent of underlying algorithms.

Result: The proposed method improves and stabilizes the average goal success rate, although individual goal performance may vary.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that this generic, environment-agnostic approach can train agents to pursue any observations in a reinforcement learning environment, making them versatile for diverse applications.

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

### [221] [Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638)
*Satchel Grant,Simon Jerome Han,Alexa Tartaglini,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether causal interventions used in mechanistic interpretability lead to out-of-distribution representations, and offers solutions to mitigate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fidelity of explanations derived from causal interventions in interpretability studies is essential for guaranteeing the reliability of insights gained about target models.

Method: The authors empirically analyze the effects of causal interventions on internal model representations, classify divergences into harmless and pernicious types, and propose an adjusted Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss to address pernicious divergences.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that causal interventions often shift model representations away from natural distributions. The proposed CL loss adjustment reduces harmful divergences while maintaining interpretative accuracy.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for more trustworthy mechanistic interpretability methods by addressing and mitigating problematic interventions.

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on probabilistic forecasting methods for partial differential dynamical systems, comparing different extensions of flow matching paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and reduce the sampling steps in forecasting partial differential systems using advanced probabilistic techniques.

Method: The paper investigates and compares methods including direct distillation, progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs, and rectified flows. Experiments include 2D slice predictions from 3D simulations.

Result: Efficient techniques for probabilistic forecasting and inflow generation for solvers are demonstrated, addressing challenges in complex dynamical systems.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of modern probabilistic methods in advancing computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy for partial differential equation systems.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

### [223] [Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647)
*Sitan Chen,Kevin Cong,Jerry Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of sequential inference in auto-regressive large language models and explores diffusion language models, particularly the masked diffusion model (MDM), which allows parallel sampling. It establishes a novel theoretical framework for analyzing MDM's sampling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the long and costly inference times associated with sequential processes in auto-regressive large language models and develop a better understanding of parallel sampling in diffusion language models.

Method: The authors provide an exact theoretical characterization of the divergence between true and sampled distributions in diffusion models, introduce a connection to univariate function approximation theory, and establish new upper and lower bounds for parallel sampling.

Result: The study identifies an optimal unmasking schedule for diffusion language models, highlights the limitations of competing with this schedule without prior distribution knowledge, and demonstrates that in some cases one can sample efficiently in O(log n) steps without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust theoretical foundation for understanding parallel sampling in diffusion language models and provides practical upper bounds for efficient sampling in specific scenarios, advancing the field's understanding of non-sequential inference.

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

*Xinlu Zhang,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive model pruning in time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed) systems, addressing the joint optimization of pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation to reduce training loss and learning latency, achieving a 40% reduction in communication cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in time-triggered federated learning, such as straggler issues and communication overhead, especially in systems with an increasing number of user devices and limited wireless bandwidth.

Method: The authors introduce adaptive model pruning to TT-Fed systems and perform a convergence analysis on the gradient l2 norm. They formulate a joint optimization problem with closed-form solutions (using KKT conditions) to optimize pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation under a delay threshold.

Result: The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach reduces communication costs by 40% while maintaining the same level of model performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive model pruning in TT-Fed effectively mitigates communication and latency issues in federated learning systems while preserving model accuracy, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained wireless environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

*Huaguan Chen,Wei Han,Haofei Sun,Ning Lin,Xingtao Song,Yunfan Yang,Jie Tian,Yang Liu,Ji-Rong Wen,Xiaoye Zhang,Xueshun Shen,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a novel 3D nowcasting framework for extreme precipitation, addressing limitations in existing methods with enhanced accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for precipitation nowcasting struggle with accuracy, speed, and capturing 3D spatial dynamics, limiting their reliability during extreme weather events.

Method: The framework combines volumetric radar data with neural operators constrained by physical principles and data-driven learning. It incorporates advection, diffusion, stochastic modeling, and residuals to enhance forecasting capabilities.

Result: The method accurately forecasts up to three-hour lead times, outperforming competing methods in a blind test with meteorologists.

Conclusion: This scalable gray-box model offers an advanced solution for physically consistent and reliable extreme precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates a 40-item math placement exam with a multi-method approach combining Classical Test Theory, machine learning, and clustering, identifying strengths and weaknesses and proposing refinements for evidence-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the accuracy and effectiveness of a mathematics placement exam and explore methods to improve it for better student placement.

Method: The study utilizes Classical Test Theory for item discrimination analysis, applies machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) for predictive power, and employs unsupervised K-means clustering to uncover natural competency groupings.

Result: 55% of items showed excellent discrimination, while 30% needed replacement. Question 6 was the most effective discriminator. Machine learning models achieved high predictive accuracy (97.5% for Random Forest). K-means identified a binary competency structure different from institutional standards.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-method approaches can enhance test optimization by identifying weak items, leveraging high-performing machine learning models, and revising competency thresholds, leading to robust and evidence-based placement decisions.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

*Domício Pereira Neto,João Correia,Penousal Machado*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper compares sep-CMA-ES evolutionary optimization with Adam in refining Stable Diffusion model outputs, showing sep-CMA-ES improves aesthetic and alignment metrics without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization techniques for diffusion models are difficult to control without retraining, prompting exploration of evolutionary algorithms in managing embedding spaces efficiently.

Method: The study employs sep-CMA-ES to optimize Stable Diffusion XL Turbo’s prompt embedding vector, with a fitness function combining LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 and CLIPScore metrics.

Result: Experiments show sep-CMA-ES outperforms Adam, achieving better aesthetic appeal and prompt alignment metrics on the P2 dataset.

Conclusion: Evolutionary methods like sep-CMA-ES can efficiently optimize prompt embeddings for diffusion models, enhancing controllability without retraining, and offer promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed
image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for
specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration,
especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising
method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models.
Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary
optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The
evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore
into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual
appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts
(P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements
in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that
the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for
diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning.
This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space
exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforced genetic approach to a defined d-resource
system optimization problem. The classical evolution schema was ineffective due
to a very strict feasibility function in the studied problem. Hence, the
presented strategy has introduced several modifications and adaptations to
standard genetic routines, e.g.: a migration operator which is an analogy to
the biological random genetic drift.

### [229] [Neural Computation Without Slots: Steps Towards Biologically Plausible Memory and Attention in Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04593)
*Shaunak Bhandarkar,James L. McClelland*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces biologically plausible mechanisms in memory modeling and computation by extending modern Hopfield networks to emulate slot-based computation found in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how biological brains, which lack slot-based memory systems, can achieve similar outcomes to AI systems that utilize such mechanisms.

Method: The paper extends the modern Hopfield network (MHN) to become ensemble-based through the introduction of the K-winner MHN and demonstrates its capability for memory retention within a continual learning context. Methods inspired by slot-based computation in AI are used to adapt the MHN for long-sequence memory and error propagation.

Result: The ensemble-based MHN improves memory retention (measured by d') compared to standard MHNs, and the extended MHN can replicate slot-based functionalities for long-sequence storage and predictions.

Conclusion: These adaptations highlight the potential of biologically plausible networks to support computations needed for advanced AI-like human cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on
multi-element patterns stored in "slots" - dedicated storage locations - in a
digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they
might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the
neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which
stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose
extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model
of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in
contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that
the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated
individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,
extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning
regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as
measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)
MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary
language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs
and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error
signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the
learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we
show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional
outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards
understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations
that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior
models have been able to achieve.

### [230] [Modular abstract syntax trees (MAST): substitution tensors with second-class sorts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03946)
*Marcelo P. Fiore,Ohad Kammar,Georg Moser,Sam Staton*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper adapts an existing framework for abstract syntax with binding and substitution to handle second-class sorts, focusing on CBV and CBPV calculi. It introduces actegories for abstract syntax representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitation in traditional abstract syntax frameworks when dealing with second-class sorts in programming languages.

Method: The study modifies the characterisation of abstract syntax from monoidal categories to actegories, leveraging bicategorical arguments to develop the framework.

Result: The paper applies the theoretical framework to prove substitution lemmas specifically for Call-by-Value settings, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: This work extends the existing syntactic theories to manage second-class sorts effectively, providing tools for proving substitution properties in certain programming calculi.

Abstract: We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with
binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class
sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value
lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting
second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the
characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to
actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through
bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution
lemmata for varieties of CBV.

### [231] [Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931)
*Iman Adibnazari,Harsh Sharma,Myungsun Park,Jacobo Cervera-Torralba,Boris Kramer,Michael T. Tolley*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores data-driven techniques for linear model generation to facilitate dynamic shape control in soft robots, comparing three methods and demonstrating the LOpInf-based model's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots lack general-purpose tools for modeling their high-dimensional dynamics, which are crucial for effective and dynamic shape control.

Method: The study evaluates three data-driven model reduction techniques: eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf). These methods are tested on a simulated eel-inspired soft robot performing trajectory tracking tasks.

Result: The LOpInf-based control policies showed the lowest tracking errors across all experiments compared to the other methods tested.

Conclusion: The LOpInf method appears to be the most effective of the methods studied, providing promising results for dynamic shape control in soft robotics.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified reinforcement learning-based controller for humanoid soccer robots, integrating visual perception and motion control to effectively handle dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in humanoid soccer robot control caused by traditional decoupled perception and motion modules, which result in delayed responses and incoherent behaviors.

Method: The paper employs a reinforcement learning approach with Adversarial Motion Priors extended to perceptual systems. It uses an encoder-decoder paired with a virtual perception system that simulates real-world visuals, enabling robots to link visual perception with motion.

Result: The proposed controller enables humanoid robots to exhibit reactive, coherent, and robust soccer behaviors in diverse scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

Conclusion: Unifying perception and motion through reinforcement learning enhances reactive and coherent soccer behaviors in humanoid robots, making them effective in dynamic, real-world environments.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

*Chenzui Li,Yiming Chen,Xi Wu,Giacinto Barresi,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to optimize upper limb posture for better ergonomics and manipulative efficiency during human-robot co-carrying tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between safety and manipulative efficiency in human-robot collaboration during co-carrying tasks.

Method: Joint angles of a human skeleton model are optimized to improve physical ergonomics and force manipulability, and a human-like robot executes planned trajectories through impedance control.

Result: Experiments show improved muscle conditions and reduced muscle activation after applying the optimization across different tasks.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances collaboration efficiency and physical ergonomics in varying human-robot co-carrying scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

### [234] [An LLM-based Framework for Human-Swarm Teaming Cognition in Disaster Search and Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04042)
*Kailun Ji,Xiaoyu Hu,Xinyu Zhang,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel LLM-CRF system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance human-swarm collaboration in disaster SAR operations, reducing task completion time, improving success rates, and lowering cognitive workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster SAR operations in complex terrains with disrupted communications create challenges for human operators in coordinating UAV swarms. The core issue is the gap between high-level intentions and low-level swarm commands under pressure.

Method: The system employs LLMs to understand operator intentions via voice/graphical input, decomposes tasks, plans missions, and provides real-time feedback within a closed-loop framework to improve UAV swarm operations.

Result: Experiments in simulated SAR scenarios show a 64.2% decrease in task completion time, a 7% increase in task success rate, and a 42.9% reduction in subjective cognitive workload compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs enable more intuitive and effective human-swarm teaming in stressful SAR situations, highlighting their potential for high-stakes human-machine collaborations.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of high-performance processors for autonomous planetary operations during entry, descent, and landing. It demonstrates significant computational speed-ups and presents a reliable fault-tolerant mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet demands for autonomous operations, such as Guidance, Navigation, Control, and Vision systems during planetary entry, descent, and landing, high-performance and fault-tolerant computing is critical.

Method: The paper analyzes deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on advanced processors like HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx Versal. It implements ARBITER, a fault-tolerant mechanism with multi-core voting for reliable execution.

Result: Achieves up to 15x speedup for LVS algorithms and over 250x speedup for trajectory optimization tasks, surpassing spaceflight legacy hardware. ARBITER validates fault detection and recovery in optimization and control systems.

Conclusion: The research supports scalable, energy-efficient architecture for future planetary missions, emphasizing reliability, autonomy, and fault tolerance critical to exploration operations.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

*Yanbo Pang,Qingkai Li,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biomimetic control framework using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS) to enable agile manipulation for robotic arms in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic arm control algorithms struggle in environments with dynamic trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects, creating a need for more adaptive and agile solutions.

Method: The paper utilizes Spiking Neural Networks to mimic the human CNS, implementing five control modules, three hierarchical control levels, and two information pathways. Each module employs SNNs, reinforcement learning, and feedback mechanisms for precise and adaptive control.

Result: The proposed framework was validated in simulations and physical tests with robotic arms under various conditions. Results showed improved manipulation agility compared to industrial-grade position control.

Conclusion: The biomimetic SNN-based framework provides a robust solution for agile robotic arm control in dynamic environments, outperforming traditional control methods.

Abstract: As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BFM-Zero is a scalable framework enabling humanoid robots to unify diverse control tasks under a single promptable policy by creating a shared latent representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches are limited to simulated humanoid robots or specific tasks, and a unified approach combining multiple capabilities is needed.

Method: BFM-Zero learns a shared latent space embedding motions, goals, and rewards, leverages unsupervised RL, forward-backward models, and applies reward shaping and domain randomization to improve simulation-to-real-world transfer.

Result: BFM-Zero demonstrates versatile whole-body skills in a real humanoid robot using zero-shot motion tracking, goal reaching, reward optimization, and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: BFM-Zero marks a significant step forward in developing promptable behavioral foundation models for scalable humanoid robot control.

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework for Active SLAM, combining a reinforcement learning approach with stagnation detection mechanisms to improve exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active SLAM methodologies struggle with slow exploration and suboptimal paths in complex environments.

Method: The framework includes Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization which balances travel distance and map uncertainty, and Lightweight Stagnation Detection that ends episodes on low map expansion rates.

Result: The proposed method reduces exploration time by up to 65% and path distance by up to 42%. It also improves training convergence and is successfully validated in real-world robotic applications.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach enhances the exploration efficiency and reliability of Active SLAM in complex environments, demonstrating practical applicability and effective transferability from simulation to real-world settings.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraspView is an RGB-only robotic grasping framework designed for cluttered environments that overcomes the limitations of RGB-D depth sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic grasping in cluttered environments is challenging due to occlusion, poor perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions. Current methods relying on RGB-D cameras often fail with transparent or glossy objects and degrade at close range.

Method: GraspView incorporates global perception scene reconstruction for consistent 3D geometry, a render-and-score active perception strategy for dynamic view selection, and an online metric alignment module for scale consistency. It fuses multi-view reconstructions and utilizes GraspNet for robust grasp execution.

Result: Experiments show GraspView outperforms RGB-D and single-view RGB methods, especially under challenging conditions like heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and transparent objects.

Conclusion: GraspView offers a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D pipelines, enabling accurate and reliable robotic grasping in real-world, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper tackles sim-to-real transfer in RL for robotics by using context-aware policies to address discrepancies in simulated and real-world dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulated RL policies often fail in real-world scenarios due to differing environment dynamics. The study seeks to improve transferability using contextual information.

Method: The authors integrate a context estimation module into a Domain Randomization-based RL framework and compare various supervision strategies for effective transfer.

Result: Context-aware policies consistently outperformed context-agnostic baselines in real-world tasks, demonstrating the advantage of integrating context estimation.

Conclusion: Utilizing context-aware policies enhances the effectiveness of sim-to-real transfer in RL for robotics, though supervision strategies should be task-specific.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

*Jinfeng Liang,Haocheng Guo,Ximin Lyu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reconfigurable wing design for tailsitter VTOL UAVs to enhance stability against wind disturbances, coupled with an efficient power system and optimized structural mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address wind disturbance issues in tailsitter UAVs during multi-rotor mode and improve efficiency in design, structure, and power consumption.

Method: The approach includes a reconfigurable wing design for varying flight modes, a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor for power efficiency, and a swashplateless mechanism with flapping hinges to control pitch/roll and reduce vibrations.

Result: Comprehensive transition flight tests demonstrated stable performance and improved efficiency across the tailsitter UAV's entire flight envelope.

Conclusion: The developed UAV design successfully resolves wind disturbance issues and enhances power efficiency and stability, broadening its usability in VTOL operations.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation requires efficient spatial understanding in unknown environments, balancing contextual representation with navigation efficiency.

Method: MacroNav includes a multi-task self-supervised lightweight context encoder and a reinforcement learning policy for action selection.

Result: MacroNav demonstrated robust and efficient environmental understanding, achieved significant performance gains in navigation metrics, and maintained low computational requirements.

Conclusion: MacroNav provides effective and computationally efficient navigation capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and proving valid in real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level
decision making. Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual
representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a
learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a
lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),
while maintaining low computational cost. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current vision-language action models and symbolic approaches in autonomous robots.

Method: The authors propose GraSP-VLA, which uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to transform human demonstrations into symbolic representations. These are then used to develop new planning domains and oversee low-level VLA policies to execute multi-step actions.

Result: GraSP-VLA successfully models symbolic representations for planning domain generation from observations. Real-world experiments demonstrate its ability to orchestrate low-level VLA tasks, facilitating long-horizon task execution.

Conclusion: GraSP-VLA effectively bridges the gap between symbolic and low-level action learning, improving scalability and generalization in robotic skill learning for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

### [244] [Studying the Effect of Explicit Interaction Representations on Learning Scene-level Distributions of Human Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04375)
*Anna Mészáros,Javier Alonso-Mora,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies methods to represent interactions among agents in a scene and their impact on the learned joint distributions in autonomous vehicle decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting the evolution of scenes involving multiple agents is crucial for better decision-making in autonomous vehicles, but there is a lack of clarity on how to best represent interactions between agents.

Method: The authors explore different ways to represent interactions among agents (implicitly via data-driven learning or explicitly based on predefined relations) within the same network structure and analyze their effects.

Result: Findings reveal that predefined interactions result in better performance compared to implicitly learning interactions solely from data.

Conclusion: Explicit representations of interactions, like defining specific relations between agents, improve the quality of learned joint distributions and enhance prediction accuracy for autonomous vehicle decision processes.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is
relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing
more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.
While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it
remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from
the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear
consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they
should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly
modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in
human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing
interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final
learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply
allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on
data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined
interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an
intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

*Dexin wang,Faliang Chang,Chunsheng Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ForeRobo introduces a generative robotic agent leveraging simulation for manipulation skills acquisition, achieving high interpretability, efficiency, and generalization in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in effective utilization of simulations for acquiring advanced manipulation skills efficiently.

Method: ForeRobo integrates generative paradigms with classical control in a self-guided cycle: propose, generate, learn, and actuate. It uses ForeGen for goal state generation and ForeFormer for state prediction based on virtual data.

Result: ForeRobo demonstrated 56.32% improvement in state generation models and 79.28% success in real-world zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, showcasing strong interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: ForeRobo provides a novel and efficient framework for skill acquisition in robotic manipulation with superior results in virtual and real-world environments compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

### [246] [Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421)
*Yueyang Weng,Xiaopeng Zhang,Yongjin Mu,Yingcong Zhu,Yanjie Li,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Action Selector (TAS), an algorithm designed to balance reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence in Learning from Demonstration (LfD), with significant performance improvements demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tradeoff issue in action chunking approaches, where improved modeling capacities come at the cost of reduced reactivity and adaptation to dynamic environments and sensor noise.

Method: The Temporal Action Selector (TAS) algorithm caches action chunks predicted at different timesteps and uses a selector network for dynamic and optimal action selection.

Result: TAS improves success rates with absolute gains up to 73.3%, enhances training efficiency, and raises performance plateaus when integrated with residual reinforcement learning (RL).

Conclusion: TAS successfully addresses the limitations of action chunking by striking a balance between reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence. Its efficacy is validated in both simulated and physical robotic experiments.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Evo-1 is a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that achieves strong performance without robot data pretraining, optimizing efficiency and deployment ease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are computationally heavy and suffer from overfitting, poor representation generalization, and inefficient deployment for real-time tasks.

Method: Evo-1 introduces a cross-modulated diffusion transformer and optimized integration module, paired with a novel two-stage progressive training paradigm to align actions with perceptual representations.

Result: Evo-1, with only 0.77 billion parameters, achieves state-of-the-art results on Meta-World and RoboTwin benchmarks (surpassing by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively) and attains competitive performance on LIBERO (94.8%), also showcasing high success rates in real-world tests.

Conclusion: Evo-1 offers significant efficiency and deployability improvements while maintaining strong task performance, paving the way for future advancements in lightweight VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

*Phat Nguyen,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Guy Rosman,Andrew Silva,Sertac Karaman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shared autonomy framework that integrates human input and autonomous systems using Vision Language Models, improving handling of rare scenarios in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving struggles in rare and ambiguous scenarios, where human drivers excel due to contextual reasoning. Shared autonomy aims to enhance system reliability by incorporating human input during uncertainty.

Method: The framework leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to interpret driver intent from multi-modal cues, combining human input with autonomous planners at a higher semantic level for coherent decision-making.

Result: In experiments, the framework achieved high accuracy in arbitration outcomes, aligning with human intent in 92% of cases and reducing collision rates in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic-level arbitration using VLMs allows shared autonomy systems to effectively align with human intent and improve performance, making them more robust in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Shuo Sha,Hanxiao Jiang,Matthew Loper,Hyunjong Song,Guangyan Cai,Zhuo Xu,Xiaochen Hu,Changxi Zheng,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating robotic manipulation policies on soft-body objects using simulations derived from real-world videos and advanced rendering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of robotic manipulation policies on deformable objects is challenging in real-world settings due to high costs, long durations, and difficulty in reproducing results.

Method: The framework uses real-world videos for constructing soft-body digital twins, employs photorealistic rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting, and validates simulations on tasks like plush toy packing and rope routing.

Result: Simulation rollouts correlate strongly with real-world performance while revealing behavioral patterns of policies, ensuring accurate and scalable evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines realistic simulations and high-quality visual fidelity, making policy evaluations for robotic systems scalable, reproducible, and precise.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

### [250] [X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671)
*Maximus A. Pace,Prithwish Dan,Chuanruo Ning,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Audrey Du,Edward W. Duan,Wei-Chiu Ma,Kushal Kedia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents X-Diffusion, a framework using the diffusion process to leverage human demonstration data without causing robots to learn dynamically infeasible motions, achieving significant improvements in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While human videos offer vast and scalable training data for robots, the difference in embodiment between humans and robots creates mismatches in action execution. This creates a need for models that harness human demonstration data effectively without compromising physical feasibility.

Method: X-Diffusion proceeds by training a classifier to determine if noisy actions are from a human or robot. Noisy human actions indistinguishable by the classifier contribute to the training. At low noise, robot-like actions are emphasized; at higher noise, mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance.

Result: X-Diffusion outperforms naive co-training under mismatches in execution feasibility, achieving an average success rate 16% higher than other baseline approaches across five manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Using a diffusion-based approach, X-Diffusion effectively aligns human demonstrations with robot capabilities, improving manipulation task performance and addressing disparities in embodiment between robots and humans.

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website

*Qingzhou Lu,Yao Feng,Baiyu Shi,Michael Piseno,Zhenan Bao,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GentleHumanoid is a framework integrating impedance control into whole-body motion tracking for humanoid robots to enable upper-body compliance and safer physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots must operate in human-centered environments where natural, safe physical interactions are critical, yet current reinforcement learning policies focus on rigid tracking and resisting extreme forces, lacking compliance.

Method: Introduces a spring-based formulation integrating impedance control for whole-body motion tracking using diverse interaction scenarios and task-adjustable force thresholds on the humanoid Unitree G1.

Result: The GentleHumanoid framework reduces contact forces during tasks such as hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and object manipulation, ensuring smoother and more natural interactions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: This work is a significant step towards developing humanoid robots capable of safely and effectively collaborating with humans and handling objects in real-world settings.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the need for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational data in software engineering when controlled experiments are not feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the software engineering process by effectively transferring research knowledge into practice, ensuring valuable contributions lead to measurable improvements.

Method: The paper discusses the use of statistical causal inference (SCI) techniques to establish causal relationships when randomized control experiments are not possible.

Result: No specific results were provided in the abstract as the paper outlines the challenges and requirements for reliable causal inference in SE.

Conclusion: Establishing causality in SE research requires robust methods beyond controlled experiments, and this paper emphasizes the importance of reliable observational data analysis.

Abstract: As any scientific discipline, the software engineering (SE) research
community strives to contribute to the betterment of the target population of
our research: software producers and consumers. We will only achieve this
betterment if we manage to transfer the knowledge acquired during research into
practice. This transferal of knowledge may come in the form of tools,
processes, and guidelines for software developers. However, the value of these
contributions hinges on the assumption that applying them causes an improvement
of the development process, user experience, or other performance metrics. Such
a promise requires evidence of causal relationships between an exposure or
intervention (i.e., the contributed tool, process or guideline) and an outcome
(i.e., performance metrics). A straight-forward approach to obtaining this
evidence is via controlled experiments in which a sample of a population is
randomly divided into a group exposed to the new tool, process, or guideline,
and a control group. However, such randomized control trials may not be
legally, ethically, or logistically feasible. In these cases, we need a
reliable process for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational
data.

*Nikta Akbarpour,Mahdieh Sadat Benis,Fatemeh Hendijani Fard,Ali Ouni,Mohamed Aymen Saied*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAMP, a lightweight framework for automated program repair in Ruby that leverages iterative feedback-driven processes without relying on large repair databases or expensive fine-tuning, achieving notable success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ruby is underexplored in Automated Program Repair (APR), despite its widespread usage in web development. Existing APR methods are computationally intensive and limited to a few languages.

Method: RAMP uses a team of collaborative agents for iterative repair, employing targeted tests, error reflection, and candidate fix refinement. It avoids heavy reliance on multilingual databases or fine-tuning, utilizing lightweight prompting and test-driven feedback.

Result: On the XCodeEval benchmark, RAMP achieves a pass@1 rate of 67% for Ruby, surpassing prior approaches and demonstrating quick convergence within five iterations. Ablation studies highlight the importance of test generation and self-reflection.

Conclusion: RAMP is an effective APR framework for Ruby, showcasing the power of multi-agent repair strategies and offering potential for extending LLM-based debugging tools to lesser-studied languages.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language
Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and
focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web
development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received
little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel
lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,
iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that
generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a
correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid
reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead
operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven
feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a
pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly
within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and
self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that
RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,
and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair
strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging
tools to under-studied languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of English language proficiency in prompts on code generation quality by LLMs, finding that more advanced prompts produce consistently correct code across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how varying natural language proficiency in prompts affects code generation quality by Foundation Models in software engineering.

Method: The study utilized the HumanEval dataset, varying English proficiency levels in prompts (from basic to advanced) across 164 programming tasks and evaluated code proficiency and correctness generated by LLMs.

Result: Higher English proficiency prompts consistently produced more correct code regardless of the model, despite varying levels of model dependency for code proficiency.

Conclusion: Natural language proficiency is crucial for enhancing code generation reliability, offering developers a tool to improve AI-generated solutions.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Foundation Model (FM)-powered tools in
software engineering, the natural language prompt has become a critical
interface between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs). While much
research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is
an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This
paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent
of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code
generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the
English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks
and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show
that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the
effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that
higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all
models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key
lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and
improve the reliability of solutions.

Result: The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art pass rates while efficiently optimizing token counts in RTL generation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper's methodology bridges the performance gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs, advancing autonomous RTL generation efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We present an agentic flow consisting of multiple agents that combine
specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools to collaboratively complete the
complex task of Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation without human
intervention. A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error
feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages
iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the
approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional
correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach
to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural
language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach
implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and
closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them.
Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark,
providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs excel in code tasks but underperform in recognizing code vulnerabilities. VulInstruct enhances detection using security specifications derived from past vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with vulnerability detection due to lack of understanding security specifications, leaving them unable to reason about flaws in code behavior.

Method: VulInstruct creates a security specification knowledge base from historical vulnerabilities, considering general and domain-specific specifications, to help LLMs detect vulnerabilities.

Result: VulInstruct demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving a 45.0% F1-score and successfully identifying new vulnerabilities, including a high-severity case.

Conclusion: VulInstruct improves vulnerability detection in code with practical utility and notable advancements over existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
understanding tasks. However, they demonstrate limited performance in
vulnerability detection and struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from
patched code. We argue that LLMs lack understanding of security specifications
-- the expectations about how code should behave to remain safe. When code
behavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability.
However, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models
unable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a
specification-guided approach that systematically extracts security
specifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct
constructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General
specifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental
safe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated
violations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct
retrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about
expected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate
VulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid
reasoning. On PrimeVul, VulInstruct achieves 45.0% F1-score (32.7% improvement)
and 37.7% recall (50.8% improvement) compared to baselines, while uniquely
detecting 24.3% of vulnerabilities -- 2.4x more than any baseline. In pair-wise
evaluation, VulInstruct achieves 32.3% relative improvement. VulInstruct also
discovered a previously unknown high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-56538) in
production code, demonstrating practical value for real-world vulnerability
discovery. All code and supplementary materials are available at

### [258] [LLM-Driven Adaptive Source-Sink Identification and False Positive Mitigation for Static Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04023)
*Shiyin Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Static analysis often struggles with incomplete specifications and false positives. The paper introduces AdaTaint, a framework leveraging LLM-driven neuro-symbolic reasoning to adaptively identify vulnerabilities and reduce false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved accuracy and reliability in static vulnerability detection, addressing the issues of incomplete specifications and frequent false positives.

Method: AdaTaint utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning with LLMs to infer and validate program specifications. This framework combines model suggestions with program facts and constraint validation for adaptive processing.

Result: AdaTaint achieved a 43.7% reduction in false positives and an 11.2% improvement in recall on benchmarks and real-world projects compared to leading tools like CodeQL, Joern, and LLM-only approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that merging LLM inference with symbolic validation significantly enhances static vulnerability analysis, offering a scalable and reliable solution.

Abstract: Static analysis is effective for discovering software vulnerabilities but
notoriously suffers from incomplete source--sink specifications and excessive
false positives (FPs). We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint
analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and
filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only
detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and
constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism.
  We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and
three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces
false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by
\textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and
LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These
findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation
offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability
analysis.

*Zhengran Zeng,Yixin Li,Rui Xie,Wei Ye,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more realistic benchmark and evaluation framework for autonomous agents in software development, revealing that state-of-the-art systems achieve limited success primarily due to challenges in requirement comprehension and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the scientific evaluation of LLM-based autonomous agents for software development, addressing the limitations of current benchmarks and evaluation methods.

Method: The authors built a challenging benchmark, E2EDevBench, and proposed a hybrid evaluation framework combining functional assessment and LLM-based requirement verification to assess agent effectiveness.

Result: The study revealed that state-of-the-art agent architectures fulfill approximately 50% of requirements on the benchmark, with success tied to task decomposition and collaboration strategies.

Conclusion: This work offers improved evaluation tools and insights into the capabilities and limitations of software development agents, pointing towards enhancing requirement understanding and planning as a critical next step.

Abstract: The development of LLM-based autonomous agents for end-to-end software
development represents a significant paradigm shift in software engineering.
However, the scientific evaluation of these systems is hampered by significant
challenges, including overly simplistic benchmarks and the difficulty of
conducting fair comparisons between different agent architectures due to
confounding implementation variables. To address these limitations, we first
construct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate
realistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation
framework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with
fine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we
conduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent
architectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of
workflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill
approximately 50\% of requirements on \bench{}, but their success is critically
dependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and
collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck
is the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work
provides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and
core challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward
enhancing requirement comprehension and planning.

### [260] [Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines how large language models (LLMs) align with human values in software engineering tasks, revealing inconsistencies in their behavior that necessitate better monitoring and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more involved in software engineering tasks, critical questions arise about their alignment with human values like fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability.

Method: The study evaluates 23 LLMs on four tasks related to responsible AI values, analyzing how well their preferences align with two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners.

Result: LLMs aligned more closely with AI practitioners than the US-representative group but showed inconsistencies between stated values and applied behavior when prioritizing software requirements.

Conclusion: Reliance on LLMs poses practical risks in requirements engineering, underscoring the need for systematic value alignment benchmarks and monitoring in AI-assisted software development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software
engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation,
raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on
responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value
preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample
and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key
responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)
resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software
requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally
align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative
sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and
accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs
claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),
revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These
findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements
engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic
approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted
software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SAFE integrates GPT-4o into an IDE to improve SAST tools' usability by enhancing vulnerability explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security vulnerabilities often go unnoticed due to poor explanations from SAST tools, which limits developers' understanding.

Method: SAFE uses GPT-4o to create detailed and comprehensible explanations for vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools.

Result: Expert user studies show SAFE helps beginner and intermediate developers better understand and address security issues.

Conclusion: SAFE enhances SAST tool usability, aiding developers in mitigating vulnerabilities effectively.

Abstract: The prevalence of security vulnerabilities has prompted companies to adopt
static application security testing (SAST) tools for vulnerability detection.
Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their
generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information
to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical
findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach
that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we
present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages
GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of
vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate
that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to
intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security
vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.

*Christos Tranoris*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Git as a lightweight coordination tool for asynchronous inter-entity communication, replacing traditional APIs and brokers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of traditional API-based and message broker systems in distributed and cross-organizational environments lead to the need for more auditable and loosely coupled communication methods.

Method: A Git-based communication model is designed, using shared repositories as mutual state sources and leveraging Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resources to enable distributed entities to interact effectively.

Result: The Git-based approach showcased transparency, traceability, and reproducibility, extending the boundaries of GitOps to asynchronous collaboration while maintaining autonomy and loose coupling.

Conclusion: This communication model offers an auditable, decentralized solution suitable for cross-domain interactions, with inherent benefits like versioning and reduced dependency on traditional integration methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and auditable method for asynchronous
information exchange between distributed entities using Git as the coordination
medium. The proposed approach replaces traditional APIs and message brokers
with a Git-based communication model built on the principles of Kubernetes
Operators and Custom Resources (CRs). Each participating entity, designated as
a Publisher or Consumer, interacts through a shared repository that serves as a
single source of truth, where the spec field captures the desired state and the
status field reflects the observed outcome. This pattern extends GitOps beyond
infrastructure management to support cross-domain, inter-organizational, and
air-gapped collaboration scenarios. By leveraging Git native features
(versioning, commit signing, and access control) the model ensures
transparency, traceability, and reproducibility while preserving loose coupling
and autonomy between systems. The paper discusses architectural principles,
implementation considerations, and comparisons with RESTful and broker-based
integrations, highlighting both the advantages and trade-offs of adopting Git
as a declarative communication substrate.

*Jiahui Wu,Chengjie Lu,Aitor Arrieta,Shaukat Ali*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriveRLR, a benchmark tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the realism of simulated driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle with ensuring safety during simulation-based testing, making realism assessment critical.

Method: DriveRLR utilizes mutated scenario variants and textual prompts to evaluate LLM robustness in assessing driving scenario realism.

Result: Testing on DeepScenario dataset with GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2 revealed DriveRLR's capability to distinguish robustness differences among LLMs.

Conclusion: DriveRLR proves effective for evaluating LLMs in assessing driving scenario realism and holds potential for improving simulation-based autonomous driving testing workflows.

Abstract: In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress,
yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based
testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained
traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However,
evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating
demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through
scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a
benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of
driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs
prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in
determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the
DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4
Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals
differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness
and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness
evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as
an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based
ADS testing workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the weaknesses of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation by identifying tasks they consistently fail, analyzing static complexity, and studying 114 tasks to uncover recurring failure patterns and benchmark complications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the knowledge gap in understanding why LLMs fail specific code generation tasks, moving beyond leaderboard rankings to focus on their limitations.

Method: The authors analyzed four popular code generation benchmarks to identify failure-prone tasks. They conducted an investigation on the role of static complexity and systematically examined 114 consistently failed tasks by LLMs.

Result: The study identified four recurring weakness patterns in LLMs and highlighted complications in benchmark tasks contributing to their frequent failures.

Conclusion: The findings point out specific areas needing improvement in LLMs and benchmark designs, providing valuable insights for developing more capable code generation models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central
focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular,
offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight
into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is
crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of
more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks
across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most
likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated
whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by
a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our
analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as
common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.

*Hao He,Courtney Miller,Shyam Agarwal,Christian Kästner,Bogdan Vasilescu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the adoption of the LLM agent assistant, Cursor, in software development, showing gains in development velocity but persistent issues with code quality and complexity leading to eventual velocity reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically investigate the claims that LLM agents significantly enhance software development productivity and to understand their broader impact on development velocity and software quality.

Method: The study employed a difference-in-differences design, comparing GitHub projects adopting the Cursor tool with matched control projects. It also utilized panel generalized method of moments estimation for deeper analysis.

Result: The adoption of Cursor led to a large initial boost in development velocity but increased static analysis warnings and code complexity. These quality issues contributed to a long-term slowdown in velocity.

Conclusion: Although LLM agents like Cursor can boost short-term productivity in development, attention must be given to their impact on code quality and complexity, as this affects long-term project efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize
the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly
gaining momentum in their application to software development, with
practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,
empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate
the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely
Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled
by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing
Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub
projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a
significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development
velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis
warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments
estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code
complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our
study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent
assistant designers, and researchers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EDIT-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate code editing capabilities of LLMs based on real-world user instructions and contexts, including 545 problems across multiple languages and use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate the real-world performance of LLMs in code editing, addressing the lack of benchmarks based on authentic user interactions and contexts.

Method: The authors created EDIT-Bench, a benchmark comprising 545 real-world-inspired problems in natural and programming languages. They evaluated 40 different LLMs based on their ability to handle context-dependent tasks.

Result: The evaluation showed EDIT-Bench to be challenging, with only 5 models scoring above 60%. Model performance varied significantly by task type and availability of contextual information.

Conclusion: EDIT-Bench highlights the importance of realistic, context-aware assessments for LLMs and reveals gaps in their ability to handle diverse real-world editing tasks effectively.

Abstract: Instructed code editing, where LLMs directly modify a developer's existing
code based on a user instruction, is becoming a widely used interaction mode in
AI coding assistants. However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability
and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world
usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild.
EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming
languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving
errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems
that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor
position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and
observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models
score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different
categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of
contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance
varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic
context.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a methodology to achieve true module independence in software design, moving beyond traditional microservice and monolithic architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of microservices in preventing dependency diffusion between modules and explore better system design approaches.

Method: Developed a conceptual method for calculating module independence, defined necessary conditions for it, and proposed universal interfaces to eliminate dependencies between modules. Used this approach to create the platform architecture named EIGHT.

Result: Demonstrated that ensuring module independence allows dynamic runtime modifications even in monolithic applications, showcasing flexibility and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture explores an innovative path for managing increasingly complex systems beyond traditional architectures like microservices or monolithic designs.

Abstract: Although microservices have physically isolated modules, they have failed to
prevent the propagation and diffusion of dependencies. To trace the root cause
of the inter-module coupling, this paper, starting from the impact assessment
approach for module changes, proposes a conceptual method for calculating
module independence and utilizes this method to derive the necessary conditions
for module independence. Then, a new system design philosophy and software
engineering methodology is proposed, aimed at eliminating dependencies between
modules. A specific pattern is employed to design a set of universal
interfaces, serving as a universal boundary between modules. Subsequently, this
method is used to implement a platform architecture named EIGHT, demonstrating
that, as long as module independence is guaranteed, even a monolithic
application within a single process can dynamically load, unload, or modify any
part at runtime. Finally, the paper concludes that this architecture aims to
explore a novel path for increasingly complex systems, beyond microservice and
monolithic architectures.

*Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper challenges reductionism, proposing that consciousness and brain function involve interactions between macro-level psychological laws and micro-level neural laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of reductionist methodology in explaining consciousness and brain functions, and to reject epiphenomenalism.

Method: The authors model the brain as operating under dual laws—macro-level psychological laws and micro-level neural laws—with causal interactions between the two.

Result: The proposed model allows for scientific testability of macro-level phenomena and rejects strict intra-level causal closure.

Conclusion: Macro-level psychological phenomena exert causal impacts on micro-level neural phenomena, requiring a new integrative approach to study consciousness and brain processes.

Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes
that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone.
This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro
phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness
suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and
reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal
closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot
be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new
methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level
phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels.
This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not
determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects
from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach
that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction
between these two sets of laws.

Motivation: The paper seeks to bridge the gap between biological neural networks and artificial intelligence by exploring neuro-inspired principles to address limitations in standard deep learning models.

Method: Analyzing how neuroscience principles, such as error computation and propagation, can be integrated into deep learning to improve incremental learning and biological plausibility.

Result: Findings highlight successful implementations of brain-inspired principles, limitations of current models, and promising paths for integrating recent neuroscience discoveries into AI.

Conclusion: Advancing AI requires leveraging recent neuroscience insights for developing biologically plausible learning mechanisms that overcome current challenges in deep learning models.

Abstract: Inspired by key neuroscience principles, deep learning has driven exponential
breakthroughs in developing functional models of perception and other cognitive
processes. A key to this success has been the implementation of crucial
features found in biological neural networks: neurons as units of information
transfer, non-linear activation functions that enable general function
approximation, and complex architectures vital for attentional processes.
However, standard deep learning models rely on biologically implausible error
propagation algorithms and struggle to accumulate knowledge incrementally.
While, the precise learning rule governing synaptic plasticity in biological
systems remains unknown, recent discoveries in neuroscience could fuel further
progress in AI. Here I examine successful implementations of brain-inspired
principles in deep learning, current limitations, and promising avenues
inspired by recent advances in neuroscience, including error computation,

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for analyzing functional brain graphs using a geometry-aware graph transformer framework, enabling better understanding and synthesis of brain connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods analyzing functional brain connectivity overlook the covariation between graph-theoretic and spectral descriptors, requiring unified approaches to capture their shared structures across brains and conditions.

Method: The authors developed a graph transformer autoencoder incorporating latent diffusion and spectral geometry to create a unified latent representation of functional brain graphs.

Result: This unified representation effectively separated cognitive states and decoded visual stimuli, while enabling biologically plausible synthetic graph generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers insights into functional brain connectivity with implications for understanding neural mechanisms and generating synthetic brain graphs.

Abstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic
or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially
overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted
functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along
which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here,
we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense
functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent
diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide
learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised,
meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with
performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the
diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible
and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.

TL;DR: The study uses a generative modeling framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to efficiently design surface topographies that obey specific friction laws, bypassing computationally expensive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in designing frictional interfaces, specifically the non-uniqueness of solutions and the high computational cost of simulating contact mechanics, by proposing a novel approach based on generative models.

Method: The researchers employed Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on a synthetic dataset of 200 million instances from a parameterized contact mechanics model. This simulation-free framework allows the generation of surface topographies tailored to specific friction laws.

Result: The proposed method efficiently generates diverse and simulation-free candidate topographies, balancing accuracy, throughput, and solution diversity. The study also identifies and discusses practical trade-offs inherent in this approach.

Conclusion: This generative modeling framework offers an effective and efficient pathway for designing frictional surfaces with tailored behavior, potentially enabling near-real-time applications. The results underscore the practical considerations and promise of such advanced methods in the field of contact mechanics.

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surrogate modeling approach, combining bifidelity Karhunen-Loève expansions (KLEs) and polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs), to efficiently and accurately model field-valued quantities under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency faced when building accurate surrogate models for field-valued outputs under uncertainty, particularly in high-fidelity scenarios.

Method: The authors propose coupling low-fidelity simulations for capturing dominant trends with limited high-fidelity simulations to correct biases while leveraging polynomial chaos expansions. An active learning strategy is utilized to iteratively improve the model using an adaptive scheme based on cross-validation, Gaussian process regression, and expected improvement criteria.

Result: The proposed framework, BF-KLE-AL, was tested on three cases (1D, 2D, and 3D problems). It consistently demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency compared to single-fidelity and random-sampling models.

Conclusion: This method provides a computationally efficient and accurate solution for surrogate modeling, particularly for complex, high-dimensional problems, enabling better resource allocation and modeling capabilities.

Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for
field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach
combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions
(PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output
fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture
dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF)
simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables
accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further
improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively
selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error,
estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression.
New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement
criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL
framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a
one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion
system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy
simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent
improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to
single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commonly used paths for dynamic measure transport are suboptimal, requiring alternative approaches to achieve efficient and smooth sampling.

Method: The authors propose optimization problems to identify tilted paths and develop a numerical method based on Gaussian process techniques for solving related partial differential equations.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrates smoother and more efficient transport models compared to traditional methods using untilted reference paths.

Conclusion: The study suggests the advantages of using alternative paths for dynamic measure transport, guided by smoothness and optimization principles.

Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of
measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the
fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing
methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these
connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying
tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms
which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a
numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process
methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the
ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models
compared to those which use an untilted reference path.

*Chiraag Kaushik,Justin Romberg,Vidya Muthukumar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces bounds for the expected operator norm of random kernel matrices and applies them to high-dimensional data problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve understanding of kernel matrix behavior, specifically in high-dimensional settings and anisotropic Gaussian data.

Method: Decoupling results for U-statistics and the non-commutative Khintchine inequality are used for bounds, alongside analyzing kernel matrix correlations.

Result: Simplified proofs of existing results, novel approximations for anisotropic Gaussian data, and tighter bias bounds for kernel regression.

Conclusion: The methods provide user-friendly and tighter bounds for kernel matrices, aiding better understanding and results in high-dimensional kernel-related problems.

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.

*Aukosh Jagannath,Taj Jones-McCormick,Varnan Sarangian*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent with momentum and adaptive step-sizes, comparing it to online SGD. It discovers new relationships, effects, and improvements in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and compare the behaviors of various SGD algorithms, particularly with momentum and adaptive step-sizes, in high-dimensional learning problems.

Method: The authors developed a high-dimensional scaling limit framework to analyze SGD-M and compare it with online SGD. Analytical and case studies on learning problems like Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models were conducted.

Result: The scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with online SGD under time-rescaling and certain step-size conditions. However, high-dimensional effects can degrade SGD-M performance if the step-sizes are not adjusted. Adaptive step-sizes lead to better stability and performance in high-dimensional regimes.

Conclusion: Early preconditioners and adaptive step-sizes are proven to stabilize and improve SGD dynamics, offering recommendations for settings where online SGD struggles in high dimensions.

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes the $  $-Stein operator, which introduces robustness in inference methods for unnormalized probability models, including robust score matching, goodness-of-fit testing, and Bayesian posterior approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to address the issue of sensitivity to outliers in inference methods for unnormalized probability models, providing a principled approach to robustness.

Method: The $ gamma-Stein operator is constructed by weighting the model density raised to a positive power ($ gamma$), hence reducing the impact of outliers, and applied to generalizing score matching and extending it to robust applications.

Result: Empirical studies on models like contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and statistical efficiency over standard baselines.

Conclusion: The $  $-Stein operator provides a promising tool for developing robust statistical methods, addressing outlier sensitivity without depending on the model's normalizing constant.

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

### [277] [Online Conformal Inference with Retrospective Adjustment for Faster Adaptation to Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04275)
*Jungbin Jun,Ilsang Ohn*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to address slow adaptation in online conformal prediction by retroactively adjusting past predictions, improving coverage recalibration and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional conformal prediction methods struggle in online environments where data distributions change over time, as they do not update past predictions and adapt slowly to new distributions.

Method: The proposed method introduces retrospective adjustment using regression and leave-one-out update formulas to retroactively modify past predictions, aligning them with recent data distributions.

Result: Numerical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show faster adjustment to distribution shifts and improved efficiency in prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The novel approach resolves slow adaptation in online conformal prediction, making the method more suitable for dynamic data environments and enhancing statistical performance.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) and its robustness in noisy environments. It derives conditions for accurate factor identification despite the noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing issue of min-vol NMF’s robustness to noise by deriving conditions under which it can successfully identify factors in noisy data.

Method: The authors introduce the 'expanded sufficiently scattered condition,' emphasizing the geometric scattering of data points in the latent simplex formed by basis vectors, ensuring robustness despite noise.

Result: The paper proves that min-vol NMF with the expanded sufficiently scattered condition can accurately identify ground truth factors, even with noise interference.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate improved robustness of min-vol NMF against noise in various applications, enabling more reliable factorization under certain data conditions.

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Søren Hauberg,Steen Markvorsen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the GEORCE-FM algorithm for faster computation of the Fréchet mean on Riemannian and Finsler manifolds while ensuring global convergence and improved performance in accuracy and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computation of the Fréchet mean on Riemannian manifolds involves solving an optimization problem, which can be computationally expensive.

Method: The paper proposes the GEORCE-FM algorithm that performs computation locally and introduces an adaptive extension to scale for large datasets.

Result: The proposed GEORCE-FM algorithm demonstrates global and local convergence theoretically and empirically outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: GEORCE-FM is a significant improvement for computing the Fréchet mean, offering faster and scalable solutions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This
is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum
of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points.
The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but
for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an
optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean
require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We
introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean
and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster
than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and
introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of
data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and
local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in
expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that
GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean
in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

*Sara Pérez-Vieites,Sahel Iqbal,Simo Särkkä,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper enhances Bayesian experimental design by introducing scalable methods based on nested particle filters for optimizing data collection in dynamical systems with noisy, incomplete observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian experimental design approaches struggle to handle dynamical systems with partial observability, where noisy and incomplete data make standard objectives like expected information gain intractable.

Method: The authors derive new estimators of expected information gain that marginalize latent states and use nested particle filters for efficient online inference.

Result: The framework is demonstrated on models like SIR and moving source localization tasks, successfully addressing issues of partial observability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable stochastic optimization for nonlinear state-space models in real-world scenarios, providing significant advancements in Bayesian experimental design for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for
optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial
real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where
only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are
naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the
link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus
information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) --
intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online
algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially
in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving
new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent
states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our
approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online
inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such
as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task,
show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and
online computation.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study links Riesz regression with direct density-ratio estimation techniques, showing their equivalence in specific scenarios like average treatment effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the connection between Riesz regression and direct density-ratio estimation within debiased machine learning frameworks.

Method: The paper explores theoretical equivalence between Riesz regression and DRE, utilizing existing methodologies such as LSIF for robust model analysis and validation.

Result: Highlights the equivalence between Riesz regression and density-ratio estimation, enabling the use of prior methods and findings (e.g., loss function selections, convergence-rate analyses).

Conclusion: Insights into this equivalence extend the applications of both Riesz regression and density-ratio estimation in debiased machine learning, enriching their theoretical and practical implementations.

Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine
learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al.,
2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct
density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-
ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz
regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,
Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz
regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer
estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to
directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including
convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via
Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible
models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz
representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct
density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in
Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines the advances in solving parameter-dependent PDEs using machine learning approaches like PINNs and neural operators, highlighting their speed, accuracy, and potential applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for solving PDEs are computationally expensive when dealing with multiple parameters. The need to make parameter exploration efficient and feasible drives this research.

Method: The study critically analyzes and compares two machine learning paradigms—PINNs and neural operators—across different scientific fields, detailing their methodologies, applications, and efficiency improvements.

Result: The analysis concludes that neural operators offer computational speedups of 10^3 to 10^5 times over traditional solvers in multi-query scenarios while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified understanding of how PINNs and neural operators can revolutionize parametric PDE solving, offering practical insights and identifying key challenges for further exploration.

Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on
parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional
numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making
parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning
advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural
operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution
operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two
main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and
excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,
DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.
Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and
electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups
of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query
scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance
for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,
convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional
parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This
work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers
via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource
for this rapidly evolving field

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the role of polyglutamine expansions and protein aggregation in Huntington's disease, focusing on the types of bonds stabilizing these aggregates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of bonds stabilizing these aggregates in Huntington's disease, as it may guide therapeutic approaches.

Method: Analyzes models of Huntington's disease in cell cultures to study hydrogen bonding and transglutaminase-catalyzed covalent bonding in protein aggregates.

Result: Cell culture models show aggregates are primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds may also play a role.

Conclusion: Understanding the bond nature in Huntington's disease aggregates is critical for developing effective therapies targeting these structures.

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

Result: The proposed method showed comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly lower computation times in simulated bandit environments.

Conclusion: The method enhances efficiency and accessibility for RL model fitting and is provided as an open-source Python package to aid researchers in analyzing their datasets with minimal technical learning barriers.

Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to
some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models
have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and
animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization
problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that
appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed
theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical
results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL
models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then
evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some
benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate
that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while
significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python
package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the
analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex
optimization.

Result: Implementation on a real construction project showed significant improvements, including reduced estimating labor (43%), reduced overtime (6%), and efficient buffer utilization (30%), while maintaining on-time project completion.

Conclusion: The integration of AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL improves forecasting, transparency, and control, providing a practical way towards predictive construction management.

Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S.

static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D
digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with
natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision

deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case
implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable
gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6%
reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an
on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin
sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate turbulent transport predictions and enable tasks like uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization by employing reduced models.

Method: Machine-learning driven regression models were constructed, utilizing an active learning strategy with sparse-grid initialization and iterative refinement by selecting informative simulation points.

Result: The models achieved robust performance and predictive accuracy, providing estimates close to reference simulations for multiple radial locations and beyond the training domain.

Conclusion: Reduced machine-learning models effectively predict ETG heat flux, offering reliable tools for stellarator plasma analysis and related computational tasks.

Abstract: Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for
accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as
uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This
paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature
Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model
predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the
normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of
normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and
the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models
across seven radial locations using regression and an active
machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using
low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their
training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing
simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models
using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$
prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction
uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced
models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat
flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models
demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the
original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the experience, exercise of power, and the role of institutional governance in shaping responses to AI's societal and technological changes.

Method: The study uses personalized questionnaires informed by Neo-institutionalist governance frameworks to collect data, presenting anonymized findings through fictional personas.

Result: The findings showcase twelve personas illustrating intersections between personal agency, organizational logics, and institutional infrastructures, as well as field-level dynamics of power.

Conclusion: This research offers practical insights for policymakers and stakeholders on engaging with AI governance effectively, presenting actionable hypotheses for studying institutional and social changes.

Abstract: This paper examines how decision makers in academia, government, business,
and civil society navigate questions of power in implementations of artificial
intelligence. The study explores how individuals experience and exercise levers
of power, which are presented as social mechanisms that shape institutional
responses to technological change. The study reports on the responses of
personalized questionnaires designed to gather insight on a decision maker's
institutional purview, based on an institutional governance framework developed
from the work of Neo-institutionalists. Findings present the anonymized, real
responses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional
personas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These
personas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and
institutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The
decision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of
the field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering
institutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing
institutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion
presents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for
change makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social

Motivation: Understanding how social platforms drive visibility and growth for open-source projects and providing actionable launch strategies for developers.

Method: A reproducible system tracks 138 repository launches on HN from 2024-2025, leveraging public APIs, machine learning models, and non-linear methods.

Result: Repositories gain 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 in 48 hours, and 289 in a week after HN exposure; posting time significantly impacts growth while the 'Show HN' tag has no distinct advantage.

Conclusion: The system provides reproducible insights into launch dynamics, empowering further research and strategy optimization for developers and researchers.

Abstract: Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source
projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate
impact remains challenging. This paper presents a reproducible demonstration
system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI
and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138
repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects:
repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48
hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning
models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify
key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching
at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag
shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The
demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware,
automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations
through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible
and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both
researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.

Motivation: To correct biases in AI systems that perpetuate marginalization of Latin American contexts through dominant Western perspectives and lack of representation from diverse languages and cultures.

Method: A culturally aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts is introduced and used to evaluate six language models through a novel Cultural Expressiveness metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses.

Result: Some models perform better in capturing Latin American perspectives, but sentiment misalignment is significant. Fine-tuning Mistral-7B boosts cultural expressiveness by 42.9%.

Conclusion: Equitable AI development requires prioritizing datasets that reflect Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and diverse languages, along with community-focused approaches to amplify marginalized perspectives.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often reflect biases from economically
advanced regions, marginalizing contexts in economically developing regions
like Latin America due to imbalanced datasets. This paper examines AI
representations of diverse Latin American contexts, revealing disparities
between data from economically advanced and developing regions. We highlight
how the dominance of English over Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous languages
such as Quechua and Nahuatl perpetuates biases, framing Latin American
perspectives through a Western lens. To address this, we introduce a culturally
aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts,
challenging Eurocentric models. We evaluate six language models on questions
testing cultural context awareness, using a novel Cultural Expressiveness
metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses. Our findings show that some
models better capture Latin American perspectives, while others exhibit
significant sentiment misalignment (p < 0.001). Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with our
dataset improves its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%, advancing equitable AI
development. We advocate for equitable AI by prioritizing datasets that reflect
Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and diverse languages, while
emphasizing community-centered approaches to amplify marginalized voices.

### [290] [Fraud-Proof Revenue Division on Subscription Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04465)
*Abheek Ghosh,Tzeh Yuan Neoh,Nicholas Teh,Giannis Tyrovolas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates subscription-based platforms, introducing a rule called ScaledUserProp to counteract manipulations more effectively than currently used mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address fraud in subscription-based models through mechanism design rather than relying solely on machine learning approaches.

Method: The authors formalized manipulation-resistance axioms, evaluated existing revenue division rules against these, and proposed the novel rule 'ScaledUserProp'. Experimental validations were conducted with real-world and synthetic data.

Result: Existing revenue mechanisms were found vulnerable to fraud and computationally intractable for detecting manipulations. ScaledUserProp successfully met all manipulation-resistance axioms.

Conclusion: ScaledUserProp offers a fraud-resistant, fairer, and more computationally efficient revenue division mechanism for subscription-based platforms compared to current methods.

Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee
for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue.
Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning
methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue
division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize
three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules
satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not
only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation
computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp,
that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments
with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a
fairer alternative compared to existing rules.

*Fatemeh Hosseinabadi,Seyedhassan Sharifi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A ResNet-based deep learning model was developed for identifying appendicitis in children using ultrasound images, achieving high accuracy and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric appendicitis poses diagnostic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and inconsistent imaging, creating a need for automated detection systems.

Method: Fine-tuned pretrained ResNet model applied to ultrasound images, with preprocessing involving normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization.

Result: The ResNet model achieved 93.44% accuracy, 91.53% precision, and 89.8% recall, demonstrating reliable detection of appendicitis despite imaging challenges.

Conclusion: The study developed a high-performing automated system for appendicitis detection in pediatric cases, addressing significant diagnostic hurdles in ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

*Fatemeh Hosseinabadi,Seyedhassan Sharifi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the nnU-Net framework for automatically segmenting the left atrium in cardiac MRI scans, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium is vital for atrial fibrillation ablation and cardiac modeling, but manual delineation is inefficient and inconsistent.

Method: The study utilized the automated nnU-Net framework for segmentation. The model adjusted preprocessing, configuration, and training to MRI data characteristics, and was tested with the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset.

Result: The nnU-Net achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 93.5, indicating high accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net model excels in automatic segmentation of the left atrium, providing accurate results and outperforming older approaches, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

*Jinyuxuan Guo,Gurnoor Singh Khurana,Alejandro Gonzalo Grande,Juan C. del Alamo,Francisco Contijoch*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces SinoFlow, a Physics-Informed Neural Network-based framework using CT sinogram data to estimate blood flow, outperforming previous image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance non-invasive imaging-based blood flow estimation by utilizing CT imaging and addressing limitations in current methods.

Method: Simulated pulsatile flow fields and CT scans with different imaging settings were used to compare SinoFlow with image-based PINN flow estimation.

Result: SinoFlow outperformed ImageFlow in accuracy, demonstrating robustness across varying imaging parameters and maintaining higher accuracy with pulsed-mode imaging.

Conclusion: SinoFlow offers a promising approach for CT-based blood flow estimation, improving accuracy and suggesting optimized acquisition parameters for future applications.

Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a
critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography
(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate
cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow
velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved
framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel
bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with
varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.
We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed
images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by
avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was
robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower
mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow
was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with
shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood
flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT
images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable
acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.

*Linchen Qian,Jiasong Chen,Ruonan Gong,Wei Sun,Minliang Liu,Liang Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to generate high-quality aortic valve meshes from 3D CT images using a template-fitting deep learning pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of the aortic valve remains challenging due to irregular topologies and inconsistencies in traditional methods, thereby complicating patient-specific simulations and assessments.

Method: A deep learning-based template-fitting pipeline generates structured quadrilateral meshes with consistent correspondences across patients, utilizing a simplified loss function focusing on geometry reconstruction and smoothness regularization.

Result: The approach produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes, achieving better smoothness and shape quality with fewer explicit regularization terms compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Structured quad mesh templates enhance modeling efficiency and effectiveness by ensuring mesh correspondence, simplifying neural network training, and maintaining high-quality outputs.

Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is
essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess
valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to
generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across
different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with
irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and
inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline
with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)
meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing
aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a
uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element
correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the
learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function
with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness
regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and
element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and
shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to
the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad
meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh
correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces μNeuFMT, a self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework, which integrates neural-based representations and photon physics to achieve robust and accurate fluorophore visualization without requiring prior knowledge of tissue optics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) techniques face challenges due to ill-posed reconstruction problems and reliance on inaccurate or unknown tissue optical properties. Conventional and supervised methods struggle to generalize beyond training datasets.

Method: The authors propose μNeuFMT, a self-supervised framework combining implicit neural scene representation with explicit physical photon propagation modeling. Key innovation includes joint optimization of fluorescence distribution and tissue optical properties during reconstruction, without prior precise knowledge of tissue optics or training data.

Result: μNeuFMT effectively reconstructs fluorescence distribution and tissue optical properties even from significantly flawed initial estimations. It outperforms both traditional and supervised deep learning methods in numerical, phantom, and in vivo experiments across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed μNeuFMT framework improves robustness and accuracy in FMT reconstruction and has potential to enhance molecular imaging applications such as fluorescence-guided surgery, providing a new paradigm for reliable imaging in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

### [296] [Explorability in Pushdown Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04048)
*Ayaan Bedi,Karoliina Lehtinen*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: This paper introduces and explores the concept of 'explorability' in pushdown automata, investigating its expressiveness and succinctness relative to history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs, and presenting a hierarchy among different levels of explorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to introduce a refined measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata, improving understanding of their operational behavior and expressiveness, with applications in theoretical computer science.

Method: The authors define 'explorability' for pushdown automata, analyze it theoretically across different levels, and compare it to existing classes like history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs.

Result: The paper establishes that increasing levels of explorability form an infinite hierarchy of strictly more expressive classes, captures context-free languages with exponential explorability, and shows significant succinctness advantages for explorable PDAs.

Conclusion: Explorability offers a novel, expressive, and operationally meaningful framework to measure nondeterminism in pushdown automata, bridging gaps between deterministic and nondeterministic systems in terms of expressiveness and succinctness.

Abstract: We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata,
which generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while
reading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step
based only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it
exists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between
history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both
expressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an
infinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than
level k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general
nondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of
explorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show
that exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages.
Finally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more
succinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between
deterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These
results position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure
of nondeterminism for pushdown systems.

*Steffen Dereich,Arnulf Jentzen,Sebastian Kassing*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Adam optimizer using an ODE-based approach, analyzing its behavior under fast-slow scaling, establishing convergence conditions, and explaining its ability to find global minima in specific settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the dynamics of the Adam optimizer, given its widespread use in deep learning, especially under specific scaling regimes and conditions.

Method: The authors utilize an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based framework to study the Adam optimizer's behavior, focusing on its trajectories and convergence.

Result: The study shows that the Adam optimizer follows the flow of an 'Adam vector field', converging to zeros of this vector field. In overparameterized settings, it can find global minima due to the objective function acting as a Lyapunov function.

Conclusion: The Adam optimizer has distinct convergence behavior based on the setting, with the potential to find global minima in overparameterized risk minimization scenarios when meeting specific conditions.

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is currently presumably the most popular optimization
method in deep learning. In this article we develop an ODE based method to
study the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum
parameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an
asymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is
referred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic
pseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.
In particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm
converges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than
a local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.
  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the
Adam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show
that in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a
Lyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a
consequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima
infinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.

TL;DR: The paper presents BTTDA, an innovative tensor-based approach for EEG feature extraction, significantly improving classification accuracy in brain-computer interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of tensor approaches in effectively capturing EEG signal complexity and enhance classification accuracy of brain signals.

Method: Proposed Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), leveraging flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction, novel forward models for HODA, and deflation schemes for improved feature representation.

Result: BTTDA achieved state-of-the-art EEG classification accuracy for ERP signals (91.25% AUC) and exceeded HODA's performance for MI signals (64.52% vs. 61.00%).

Conclusion: BTTDA offers efficient and interpretable dimensionality reduction suitable for EEG feature extraction, presenting a promising approach for BCIs and neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain
and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record
neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are
essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including
event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current
tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack
the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study
introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel
tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance
classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality
reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a
novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme
to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature
representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant
PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and
MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.
Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the
traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art
performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and
PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%
> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more
efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.
This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI
and broader neuroimaging applications.

Motivation: Address issues like faults and performance bottlenecks arising from increasing complexity in multi-agent systems.

Result: Implemented OptiMA framework, demonstrating its ability to manage more than 100 agents with performance improvements of over 16%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles faults and performance issues in VCMAS, while providing tools for future research on transaction scheduling.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of pre-trained transformer-based language models in AQG, particularly their difficulties in controlling problem complexity and cognitive demands.

Method: The authors introduce a collaborative multi-agent framework that uses inference-time computation where multiple agents iteratively refine questions and answers to achieve a balance between complexity and cognitive demands.

Result: Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that this approach improves the quality of generated educational content by enhancing the balance between cognitive challenge and clarity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that collaborative multi-agent workflows hold significant promise for creating controlled, high-quality, and pedagogically valuable content for automated educational systems and adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior and generating citation networks, enabling new research methodologies in social science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and expand the capacities of LLMs in replicating and analyzing human behavior, especially in the context of social science and citation networks.

Method: The paper introduces the CiteAgent framework, leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate citation networks. It also proposes two research paradigms: LLM-based Survey Experiment (LLM-SE) and Laboratory Experiment (LLM-LE).

Result: The CiteAgent framework successfully reproduces real-world citation network properties (e.g., power-law distribution) and offers new perspectives on experimenting with social phenomena. It also validates and challenges existing theories in science of science research.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in advancing social simulations, enabling innovative research in citation behaviors and providing insights into academic environments.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to
encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by
leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM
capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social
attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate
citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents.
CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation
networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and
shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two
LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey
Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms
facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to
validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research
scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social
experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights
for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of
LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.

*Hayafumi Watanabe*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces a piecewise power-law model for analyzing social diffusion patterns, discovering that sub-exponential growth is common and influenced by the nature of topics and types of social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore and model complex growth patterns in social phenomena, moving beyond conventional S-shaped growth models and incorporating sub-exponential patterns.

Method: The researchers used a piecewise power-law model to analyze a dataset comprising one billion Japanese blog articles cross-referenced with Wikipedia vocabulary, supplemented by web search trend data in three languages. They evaluated 2,965 items and categorized growth patterns.

Result: They found that around 55% of items fit the piecewise power-law model with one or two segments, often showing sub-exponential growth. Characteristics such as growth rate, diffusion scale, and topic nature were identified as key variables influencing these patterns.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that sub-exponential growth is a widespread phenomenon in societal idea diffusion. The proposed model is useful for describing and interpreting these patterns, offering insights into the dynamics of social spread and communication preferences.

Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been
described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of
sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in
epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we
present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with
a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of
approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia
vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English,
Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that
about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well
captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i)
the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent
sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily
determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the
duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the
topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones.
Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with
strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha
can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented
communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common
pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for
consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth
curves.

Method: A systematic evaluation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic query perturbations across various CLIP model variants using TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and V3C1 video collection.

Result: The study finds that syntactic and semantic perturbations cause significant instabilities, while trivial edits like punctuation and case still result in brittleness across tested models.

Conclusion: Robustness, alongside accuracy, is crucial for evaluating vision-language models in multimedia information retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of
the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in
recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space.
However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability
towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually
expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in
the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query
perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a
diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple
CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video
collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations
drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial
surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as
a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark
accuracy.

### [304] [Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04361)
*Dennis Thumm*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) to analyze electricity prices using interpretable factors, learned causal structure, and enables counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy markets have complex dynamics influenced by various factors like weather and generation technologies, but existing models lack explicit causal interpretation and counterfactual reasoning.

Method: The method involves creating ATSCM, which combines neural causal discovery and interpretable factors to learn time-varying causal graphs and model multivariate temporal data.

Result: ATSCM successfully models energy systems, learns causal relationships, and allows counterfactual queries, particularly for analyzing alternative renewable generation scenarios in electricity markets.

Conclusion: ATSCM enhances causal reasoning and counterfactual analytics in energy markets, presenting a robust framework for understanding and predicting electricity price dynamics.

Abstract: Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns,
generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring
continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model
electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual
reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models
(ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to
multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models
energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand
patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate
neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring
ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables
novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different
renewable generation scenarios?".

### [305] [evomap: A Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04611)
*Maximilian Matthe*

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: The paper introduces evomap, a Python package enabling dynamic mapping and visualization of evolving relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing statistical software mainly focuses on static mapping, which does not analyze how relationships evolve over time. There is a need for dynamic mapping solutions.

Method: Evolving static mapping techniques into dynamic mapping by implementing EvoMap framework in Python. Includes methods like MDS, Sammon Mapping, and t-SNE, along with data preprocessing tools.

Result: Evomap enables dynamic mapping with multiple techniques and provides utilities for preprocessing, exploration, and evaluating results.

Conclusion: The evomap package addresses the lack of dynamic analysis tools in mapping methods, offering a comprehensive toolkit to study evolving relationships.

Abstract: This paper presents evomap, a Python package for dynamic mapping. Mapping
methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among
objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical
software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at
a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships
evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework
EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts
traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports
multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result
evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications.
This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes
the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application
through an extensive usage example.

*Jessi Cisewski-Kehe,Brittany Terese Fasy,Alexander McCleary,Eli Quist,Jack Ruder*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-optimized vectorized framework for calculating weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF), with speed improvements reaching up to 180 times compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for computing WECT and ECF are slow and inefficient, particularly for higher-dimensional settings.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that uses tensor operations optimized for GPU architectures to compute topological transforms effectively across general geometric or cubical complexes.

Result: The new framework showed significant experimental speedups, up to 180 times faster than previous methods, while maintaining high scalability and generality.

Conclusion: This work presents a substantial improvement in the computation of topological transforms by introducing GPU-optimized tensor operations, implemented through the Python package pyECT.

Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic
function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized
for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we
present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using
tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in
full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of
arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant
speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and
ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is
implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.

*Oskar Lappi,Huw Leggate,Yannick Marandet,Jan Åström,Keijo Heljanko,Dmitriy V. Borodin*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Eiron, an open-source code employing a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm addressing scalability and memory constraints of EIRENE, demonstrating strong and weak scaling advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIRENE lacks domain decomposition, limiting its applicability for simulations requiring data beyond the memory capacity of a single compute node.

Method: A new domain decomposition Monte Carlo algorithm (DDMC) was developed and implemented in Eiron, along with two other parallel algorithms from EIRENE for comparison.

Result: DDMC showed superior performance, strong scaling benefits (superlinear on Mahti for large grids), and reasonable weak scaling efficiency across cores.

Conclusion: Integrating the DDMC algorithm into EIRENE would enhance its capability by overcoming memory constraints and improving performance for large-scale simulations.

Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the
fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it
impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one
compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte
Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code,
Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in
Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests,
with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases.
On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids
that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also
scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency
of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a
low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this
domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable
simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.

*Yoh-ichi Mototake,Makoto Sasaki*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to quantify uncertainties in Physics-informed machine learning, showing that unique model identification is possible by applying geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in estimating physically meaningful solutions amidst uncertainties in the coefficient functions of Physics-informed machine learning models.

Method: Developed an uncertainty quantification framework applied to a reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics, incorporating geometric constraints for unique identification.

Result: The framework demonstrates existing uncertainties in PIML and proves that unique coefficient function estimation is achievable with geometric constraints.

Conclusion: Geometric constraints enhance the ability to uniquely identify physical models in Physics-informed machine learning frameworks, addressing the inherent uncertainties.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential
equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such
as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that
characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding
and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in
PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as
a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models.
For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small
discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to
the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven
model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically
meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and
analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML.
We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our
framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is
possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate
the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.

### [309] [Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03898)
*Arup Datta,Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates secure code generation by assessing the performance of instruction-tuned code LLMs using reflexion prompting and security metrics, finding security improvement through iterative prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of generating secure code despite language models like LLMs being widely used for code drafting and refactoring, as insecure code remains a common concern.

Method: The paper evaluates five instruction-tuned LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a multi-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured with the Insecure Code Detector (ICD) and analyzed using metrics like Repair, Regression, and NetGain.

Result: Initial results showed that 25-33% of zero-shot programs were insecure. Python had the highest secure rates while C and C# had the least. Reflexion prompting improved security across models, with accuracy rising from an average of 70.74% at baseline to 79.43% after three prompting rounds.

Conclusion: Reflexion prompting is an effective method for improving the security of code generated by LLMs, with the majority of improvements occurring in the initial stages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code,
but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code
generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required
prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs
using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach.
Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are
reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the
programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains
common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a
zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the
hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded
secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C
and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion
prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from
70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round
followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and
NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the
benefits. A replication package is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid analytical framework combining statistical modeling and machine learning to detect and forecast cyberattack patterns in e-commerce using the VCDB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms, which threaten consumer trust and operational integrity.

Method: The research applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting, Mann-Whitney U test and ANOVA for statistical analysis, and machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) for predictive classification.

Result: CatBoost achieved the best accuracy (85.29%) and predictive metrics, and the study highlighted seasonal attack spikes during holidays with elevated risks involving PII.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework provides proactive insights for cybersecurity resource allocation and real-time threat detection research opportunities while addressing data limitations and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms have grown in sophistication,
threatening consumer trust and operational continuity. This research presents a
hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine
learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce
domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study
applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including
a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday
shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than
non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in
threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and
CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent
attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday
seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the
highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247).
The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable
ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type
classification. Ethical considerations, including responsible use of sensitive
data and bias assessment, were incorporated. Despite class imbalance and
reliance on historical data, the study provides insights for proactive
cybersecurity resource allocation and outlines directions for future real-time
threat detection research.

*Hongwei Yao,Yun Xia,Shuo Shao,Haoran Shi,Tong Qiao,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates vulnerabilities in large language model (LLM) safety guardrails and proposes a reinforcement learning-based attack method to reverse-engineer them efficiently, exposing critical issues in current safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and analyze the vulnerabilities in large language models’ (LLMs) safety guardrails, which aim to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints.

Method: The researchers developed a Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA) framework, leveraging reinforcement learning and a genetic algorithm-based data augmentation method. This method collects input-output pairs, focuses on divergences, and uses targeted mutations and crossovers to create a high-fidelity surrogate for the victim guardrails.

Result: The proposed GRA method achieved over 0.92 rule matching accuracy in reverse engineering the guardrail policies of three commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3) at a cost of less than $85 in API usage.

Conclusion: The study identifies significant vulnerabilities in current LLM guardrail implementations, demonstrating the practical feasibility of reverse-engineering these safety mechanisms and urging the need for stronger defense strategies in LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce
ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While
effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new
class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this
work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering
attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement
learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data
augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By
iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and
applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges
toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on
three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3,
and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while
requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical
feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks
for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities
in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust
defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

### [312] [Hybrid Fuzzing with LLM-Guided Input Mutation and Semantic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03995)
*Shiyin Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops a hybrid fuzzing framework integrating static and dynamic analysis with LLM-guided input mutation and semantic feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fuzzing methods are limited by their lack of semantic awareness, resulting in redundant test cases and slow exploration of complex program states.

Method: The framework uses static analysis for control-flow and data-flow extraction, LLMs for generating diverse inputs, and combines traditional code coverage feedback with semantic feedback during execution.

Result: Evaluations on open-source software show faster bug discovery, greater semantic diversity in inputs, and competitive findings compared to leading fuzzing tools.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning and semantic-aware feedback significantly improve the efficiency and depth of automated vulnerability discovery using fuzzing techniques.

Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability
discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness,
leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In
this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and
dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and
semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow
information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to
generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution,
I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback
signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output
semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program
behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++,
combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity
metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets,
including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves
faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number
of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the
potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate
and deepen vulnerability discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional DDoS detection systems, which often lack scalability and interpretability, hindering effective and real-time responses to sophisticated attacks.

Method: The method integrates the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) for automating ML model and feature selection with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for enhancing model interpretability.

Result: The approach improves DDoS detection accuracy and transparency, highlighting critical features such as mean backward packet length and minimum forward packet header length.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for DDoS detection, enhancing both the efficiency and understanding of the detection process.

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and
interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle
with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and
understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for
detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The
proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to
automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the
need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is
incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights
into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By
combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this
approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and
minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks,
offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenges of safeguarding sensitive data in cloud environments during processing, which is not entirely protected by classical security methods.

Method: The research includes a comprehensive literature survey on TEEs, their architecture, security features, deployment strategies, and practical applications.

Result: TEEs play a pivotal role in strengthening cloud security infrastructures, while issues such as deployment challenges, weaknesses, scalability, and integration are highlighted.

Conclusion: TEEs provide a strong foundation for Confidential Computing, advancing cloud data security but require attention to deployment and integration challenges.

Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage
capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the
process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of
safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption
at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to
various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing
has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of
hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts
within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even
with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we
have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and
ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a
thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies,
performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose.
In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible
weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on
the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security
infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation
for Confidential Computing.

TL;DR: The paper presents HACI, an educational tool using haptic and audio feedback to assist visually impaired (VI) students in programming education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance programming education accessibility for visually impaired students to provide equitable educational opportunities in computer science.

Method: HACI combines a web application with haptic feedback gloves powered by Arduino, focusing on JavaScript programming. A pilot study was conducted for evaluation.

Result: HACI improves non-visual code navigation and understanding but faces challenges in consistency, reliability, and feature refinement.

Conclusion: The integration of haptic and audio feedback enhances VI students' programming education, highlighting potential for further development in accessible STEM tools.

Abstract: This thesis introduces the Haptic-Audio Code Interface (HACI), an educational
tool designed to enhance programming education for visually impaired (VI)
students by integrating haptic and audio feedback to compensate for the absence
of visual cues. HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application
supporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected
via a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to
provide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide
equitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve
non-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging
for students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work
details HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary
evaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science
students. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and
understanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining
feedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as
supplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and
customizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired
students to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study
underscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in
educational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for
future research and development in accessible programming education. This
thesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how
tactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational
tools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MazeMate, an LLM-powered chatbot integrated into a 3D maze game to support computational thinking (CT) in students, with mixed results on effectiveness and suggestions for future improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in leveraging large language models to foster computational thinking skills, specifically by exploring adaptive programming education tools within gamified environments.

Method: The authors developed a 3D maze programming game called MazeMate that uses an LLM-powered chatbot to provide adaptive and context-specific scaffolds aligned with CT processes. They conducted a classroom study with 247 undergraduates to evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: Students found MazeMate moderately helpful, with higher usefulness perceived in maze solving rather than maze design. Thematic analysis indicated some success in supporting decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, but noted challenges like mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential of LLM-based scaffolding for advancing computational thinking while identifying areas for improvement, particularly in maze design support and overall usability enhancements for practical classroom applications.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a foundational problem-solving skill, and
gamified programming environments are a widely adopted approach to cultivating
it. While large language models (LLMs) provide on-demand programming support,
current applications rarely foster CT development. We present MazeMate, an
LLM-powered chatbot embedded in a 3D Maze programming game, designed to deliver
adaptive, context-sensitive scaffolds aligned with CT processes in maze solving
and maze design. We report on the first classroom implementation with 247
undergraduates. Students rated MazeMate as moderately helpful, with higher
perceived usefulness for maze solving than for maze design. Thematic analysis
confirmed support for CT processes such as decomposition, abstraction, and
algorithmic thinking, while also revealing limitations in supporting maze
design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions.
These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based scaffolding to support CT
and underscore directions for design refinement to enhance MazeMate usability
in authentic classrooms.

*Sanidhya Vijayvargiya,Rahul Lokesh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing context-efficient on-device AI agents via dynamic memory systems, tool schema serialization, and schema-passing mechanisms to achieve high performance with reduced memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome memory constraints in on-device AI agents, which limit their ability to maintain rich, stateful interactions and support complex tool capabilities.

Method: The framework incorporates three optimizations: dynamic memory using LoRA adapters, a minimalist serialization format, and just-in-time schema-passing for tools. A 3B parameter SLM model is adapted to test the approach.

Result: The proposed framework matches or surpasses conventional baselines in performance while significantly reducing context memory requirements by over 6 times for the initial prompt and 10-25 times for context growth.

Conclusion: Strategic context management is crucial for making on-device AI agents capable and persistent without compromising performance or functionality.

Abstract: On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency
assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory
capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window
creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex
tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this
trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by
three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized
LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and
structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool
schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time
schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool
selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to
context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a
conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the
performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,
achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a
10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction
verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking
capable and persistent on-device AI.

Conclusion: LLMs should evolve to support human accompaniment and guidance responsibly, addressing risks while enhancing trust, reliability, and ethical integration in various sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models are moving beyond transactional question answering to
act as companions, coaches, mediators, and curators that scaffold human growth,
decision-making, and well-being. This paper proposes a role-based framework for
human-centered LLM support systems, compares real deployments across domains,
and identifies cross-cutting design principles: transparency, personalization,
guardrails, memory with privacy, and a balance of empathy and reliability. It
outlines evaluation metrics that extend beyond accuracy to trust, engagement,
and longitudinal outcomes. It also analyzes risks including over-reliance,
hallucination, bias, privacy exposure, and unequal access, and proposes future
directions spanning unified evaluation, hybrid human-AI models, memory
architectures, cross-domain benchmarking, and governance. The goal is to
support responsible integration of LLMs in sensitive settings where people need
accompaniment and guidance, not only answers.

### [319] [Not All Explanations are Created Equal: Investigating the Pitfalls of Current XAI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03730)
*Joe Shymanski,Jacob Brue,Sandip Sen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Current XAI evaluation methods rely heavily on ad hoc techniques or user surveys, which might not accurately gauge explanation quality. This study critiques these approaches and emphasizes actionable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy in determining the quality of AI-generated explanations using traditional user surveys and metrics, which might not reflect true explanation effectiveness.

Method: The study uses an AI agent assistant teaching chess concepts to evaluate the effects of actionable and placebic explanations, analyzing their impact on user satisfaction and demonstrating the shortcomings of simplistic evaluation methods.

Result: The study finds that user satisfaction increases with any explanation, irrespective of its correctness or quality, highlighting the need for improved evaluation methods in XAI.

Conclusion: The paper calls for more comprehensive XAI evaluation techniques that go beyond user satisfaction to truly assess explanation quality. It also advocates for prioritizing actionable explanations and identifies contexts where different types of explanations are useful.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to create transparency in
modern AI models by offering explanations of the models to human users. There
are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of
these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like
"fidelity". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best
and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple
user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those
generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate
evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe
any kind of explanation will be "better" in most metrics when compared to none
at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations,
regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also
propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We
demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to
teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call
to action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for
future research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction.
Additionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or
actionable explanations would be most useful.

*Fengming Liu,Shubin Yu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MimiTalk is a dual-agent AI designed for ethical and scalable data collection in social science, outperforming human interviews in several aspects such as coherence and information richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of ethical and scalable conversational data collection in social science research.

Method: The framework uses a dual-agent system with a supervisor model and conversational model and was evaluated through three studies involving usability tests, AI vs. human interview comparisons, and interdisciplinary researcher evaluations.

Result: MimiTalk reduces interview anxiety, ensures conversational coherence, and provides richer and more stable information compared to human interviews.

Conclusion: The dual-agent framework of MimiTalk facilitates effective human-AI collaboration for qualitative research, making it replicable, scalable, and quality-controlled.

Abstract: We present MimiTalk, a dual-agent constitutional AI framework designed for
scalable and ethical conversational data collection in social science research.
The framework integrates a supervisor model for strategic oversight and a
conversational model for question generation. We conducted three studies: Study
1 evaluated usability with 20 participants; Study 2 compared 121 AI interviews
to 1,271 human interviews from the MediaSum dataset using NLP metrics and
propensity score matching; Study 3 involved 10 interdisciplinary researchers
conducting both human and AI interviews, followed by blind thematic analysis.
Results across studies indicate that MimiTalk reduces interview anxiety,
maintains conversational coherence, and outperforms human interviews in
information richness, coherence, and stability. AI interviews elicit technical
insights and candid views on sensitive topics, while human interviews better
capture cultural and emotional nuances. These findings suggest that dual-agent
constitutional AI supports effective human-AI collaboration, enabling
replicable, scalable and quality-controlled qualitative research.

### [321] [Conversational Collective Intelligence (CCI) using Hyperchat AI in an Authentic Forecasting Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03732)
*Hans Schumann,Louis Rosenberg,Ganesh Mani,Gregg Willcox*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Hyperchat AI enables group discussions with enhanced predictive accuracy, demonstrated by outperforming Vegas odds in MLB game forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how Hyperchat AI can enhance Collective Intelligence (CI) and predictive accuracy in large group discussions.

Method: A study involved groups of 24 sports fans using Hyperchat AI to forecast outcomes of 59 MLB games through AI-facilitated conversations.

Result: Groups achieved 78% accuracy for High Confidence picks, significantly exceeding Vegas odds of 57% and yielding a potential ROI of 46%.

Conclusion: Hyperchat AI effectively enhances group forecasting accuracy, especially when high conversational interaction is present, supporting its potential in decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Hyperchat AI is a novel agentic technology that enables thoughtful
conversations among networked human groups of potentially unlimited size. It
allows large teams to discuss complex issues, brainstorm ideas, surface risks,
assess alternatives and efficiently converge on optimized solutions that
amplify the group's Collective Intelligence (CI). A formal study was conducted
to quantify the forecasting accuracy of human groups using Hyperchat AI to
conversationally predict the outcome of Major League Baseball (MLB) games.
During an 8-week period, networked groups of approximately 24 sports fans were
tasked with collaboratively forecasting the winners of 59 baseball games
through real-time conversation facilitated by AI agents. The results showed
that when debating the games using Hyperchat AI technology, the groups
converged on High Confidence predictions that significantly outperformed Vegas
betting markets. Specifically, groups were 78% accurate in their High
Confidence picks, a statistically strong result vs the Vegas odds of 57%
(p=0.020). Had the groups bet against the spread (ATS) on these games, they
would have achieved a 46% ROI against Vegas betting markets. In addition, High
Confidence forecasts that were generated through above-average conversation
rates were 88% accurate, suggesting that real-time interactive deliberation is
central to amplified accuracy.

*Liam Bakar,Zachary Englhardt,Vidya Srinivas,Girish Narayanswamy,Dilini Nissanka,Shwetak Patel,Vikram Iyer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SnappyMeal, an AI dietary tracking system, addressing limitations in current food logging methods by utilizing multimodal inputs for improved flexibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing food logging methods, such as handwritten and app-based journaling, are inflexible and lead to low adherence and inaccurate nutritional summaries. There is a need for improved dietary tracking systems to enhance user engagement and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose SnappyMeal, which uses multimodal inputs like goal-specific follow-ups, grocery receipt analysis, and nutritional databases to log food intake. They conducted evaluations using nutrition benchmarks and a 3-week, multi-user study with over 500 logged meals.

Result: SnappyMeal was praised for its flexible input methods and perceived accuracy by users. The system demonstrated significant improvements in dietary tracking capabilities.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI systems like SnappyMeal can enhance flexibility and accuracy in food logging, providing a foundation for advanced self-tracking applications and improved health outcomes.

Abstract: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in
uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.
Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice
dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and
app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and
potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by
prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.
In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that
leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food
intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to
intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from
user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We
evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a
multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food
instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and
reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI
systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility
and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent
self-tracking applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of AI tools like ChatGPT on students' metacognitive processes in university-level programming. It evaluates over 10,000 dialogue logs and surveys to provide insights for designing AI tools that enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore how generative AI tools influence key metacognitive processes in programming education, addressing a gap in existing research that focuses more on correctness and usability rather than learning engagement.

Method: The authors analyzed over 10,000 dialogue logs of student-AI interactions from programming courses spanning three years, complemented by surveys from students and educators, focusing on metacognitive phases and strategies.

Result: Findings revealed patterns of how prompts and AI responses align with metacognitive phases, offering insights into strengthening metacognitive engagement while using AI coding assistants.

Conclusion: The study concludes with actionable design considerations for educational AI tools, advocating for innovations that support, rather than replace, metacognitive processes to improve programming education.

Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT now provide novice programmers with
unprecedented access to instant, personalized support. While this holds clear
promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains
underexplored. Existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability,
with limited attention to whether and how students' use of AI assistants
supports or bypasses key metacognitive processes. This study addresses that gap
by analyzing student-AI interactions through a metacognitive lens in
university-level programming courses. We examined more than 10,000 dialogue
logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and
educators. Our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with
metacognitive phases and strategies. Synthesizing these findings across data
sources, we distill design considerations for AI-powered coding assistants that
aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. Our findings
provide guidance for developing educational AI tools that strengthen students'
learning processes in programming education.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a tool that integrates synthetic data into the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm to enable flexible, user-defined evaluation, enhancing efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm caused by the scarcity of diverse and representative data for refining evaluation criteria.

Method: Developed a tool that allows users to generate synthetic test cases (configurable by domain, persona, length, and outcomes) and offers AI-assisted inline editing, while ensuring transparency through revealing prompts and explanations.

Result: A user study (N=24) showed 83% of participants preferred the tool due to its ability to rapidly generate diverse data. The synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data in refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed tool demonstrates that synthetic data generation offers an efficient and scalable alternative for refining evaluation criteria in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm enables flexible, user-defined evaluation, but
its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of diverse, representative
data for refining criteria. We present a tool that integrates synthetic data
generation into the LLM-as-a-judge workflow, empowering users to create
tailored and challenging test cases with configurable domains, personas,
lengths, and desired outcomes, including borderline cases. The tool also
supports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance
transparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations
behind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred
the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to
rapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The
generated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both
refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These
findings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in
contexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.

*Natalia Glazman,Jyoti Mangal,Pedro Borges,Sebastien Ourselin,M. Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent variable model to better understand Alzheimer's disease progression using pseudotime, achieving better diagnosis prediction and uncovering novel causal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods rely on static graph assumptions that don't account for the dynamic and evolving nature of diseases like Alzheimer's, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The authors applied a latent variable model to infer pseudotime from real-world Alzheimer's data, used it to order patients along a data-driven disease trajectory, and incorporated minimal background knowledge to improve causal graph accuracy.

Result: Pseudotime improved diagnosis prediction accuracy significantly (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59 with age), and minimal background knowledge enhanced graph precision and orientation.

Conclusion: This framework successfully captures dynamic causal interactions between both novel and established markers of Alzheimer's, enabling practical insights despite widely violated static assumptions.

Abstract: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.

Motivation: University students struggle with a lack of personalized guidance, as existing digital tools fail to offer customized mentorship at scale.

Method: An AI-powered chatbot with a data ingestion pipeline processes data from various sources. The chatbot uses BM25 lexical ranking, ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and the LLaMA-3.3-70B model for generating responses.

Result: The chatbot achieved high semantic relevance with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a METEOR score of 0.809. Data pipeline updates were efficient, needing only 106.82 seconds compared to 368.62 seconds for new data processing.

Conclusion: The chatbot is expected to assist students with queries, enhance their understanding of university life, and help in semester planning, offering a compelling solution to improve the mentorship experience for students.

Abstract: University students face immense challenges during their undergraduate lives,
often being deprived of personalized on-demand guidance that mentors fail to
provide at scale. Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of
customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot
that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main
component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates
information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages.
The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25
lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language
Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text
was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a
METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82
seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will
be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a
better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better
routines for their semester in the open-credit university.

*Zefeng Li,Ning Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces DRCSD, a GNN-based CF model designed to address noise issues in recommendation systems by employing structured denoising strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from reduced accuracy due to noise in user-item interaction matrices, which interrupts path-dependent information.

Method: The proposed DRCSD model uses a collaborative signal decoupling module to separate signals and an order-wise denoising module for structured noise reduction. It modifies the traditional information aggregation mechanism to prevent interference until final pooling.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show DRCSD is more robust against noise and improves recommendation accuracy compared to existing models.

Conclusion: DRCSD offers a novel way to enhance collaborative filtering by effectively handling noise through structured signal decomposition and targeted denoising strategies, achieving superior recommendation performance.

Abstract: Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable
performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal
recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.
Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most
existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause
attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can
interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative
information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel
GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD
includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes
signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise
denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the
information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is
modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling
operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that
DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves
statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-Gaussian cosmological information from large-scale structures and enhance inference pipelines for upcoming cosmological surveys, leveraging deep learning and simulation-based approaches.

Method: The pipeline uses scalable forward modeling with over one million mock simulations, trains deep graph convolutional neural networks for feature extraction, and employs normalizing flows for likelihood estimation in a multi-parameter space. Robustness is validated using synthetic observations and independent galaxy catalogs.

Result: Significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints were observed, with 2-3x higher performance figures in key cosmological planes compared to baseline methods, breaking parameter degeneracies.

Conclusion: The results highlight the effectiveness of simulation-based inference with deep learning, offering promising advancements in cosmology for future wide-field imaging surveys.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful
techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for
a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model
based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one
million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.
Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural
networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn
low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with
target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation
of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter
space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias
parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear
bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference
pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic
contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.
Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter
constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m -
S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and
effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These
results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for
upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.

*Dennis Hendriks,Michel Reniers,Wan Fokkink,Wytse Oortwijn*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in synthesis-based engineering (SBE) for supervisory controllers in cyber-physical systems using ESCET and the CIF toolkit, benchmarks, performance improvements, and multi-level synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the design and implementation of supervisory controllers in cyber-physical systems by automating processes and focusing on requirements rather than low-level design details using synthesis-based engineering (SBE).

Method: The paper describes CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, introduces benchmark models, evaluates synthesis performance improvements, and explores future potential with multi-level synthesis.

Result: The CIF-based synthesis algorithm prevents runtime errors, handles diverse requirements effectively, and connects systems to external inputs. Performance evaluations highlight substantial improvements between ESCET versions and demonstrate potential gains from multi-level synthesis.

Conclusion: SBE advancements through the CIF toolkit improve practical synthesis performance, but additional development is needed to address complex models more efficiently, especially in multi-level synthesis.

Abstract: Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their
correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to
largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based
engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what'
the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it
(design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering
Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and
tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process,
particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we
first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis
algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the
literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of
runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input
variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe
CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and
academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent
improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024)
that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and
show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly
look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate
its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis
performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize
complex models.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel deep convolutional neural network method to select model classes based on response signals, useful for structural health monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method capable of determining model classes from response signals alone, aiding in structural health monitoring and overcoming the need for full system identification.

Method: A one-dimensional convolutional neural network was trained and validated using response signals and their class information, with an optional enhancement using Kalman filter fusion of response signals following certain kinematic constraints.

Result: The approach effectively identified model classes with slight signal variations caused by damping or hysteresis behavior in both linear/nonlinear dynamic systems and a 3D finite element building model.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential as a powerful tool for structural health monitoring by accurately selecting model classes under various dynamic conditions based on response signals alone.

Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep
convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet
effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom
along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional
convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class
of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information,
or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement
is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals
using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data.
Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal
variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both
linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite
element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring
applications.

TL;DR: The study proposes DRAMN, a hybrid system integrating physics-informed analysis and deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of inverter-based resources in modern power systems introduces complex dynamics that challenge the scalability and effectiveness of traditional stability assessment methods.

Method: A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network (DRAMN) is developed, incorporating graph convolution into recurrent gating mechanisms. The method uses sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to create time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to model power system dynamics.

Result: DRAMN outperforms traditional and graph-based machine learning approaches, achieving high average accuracy rates (up to 99.90%). It reduces feature dimensionality by 82% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: DRAMN offers state-of-the-art accuracy and enhanced interpretability for power system stability forecasting and is well-suited for real-time implementation in modern control centers.

Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources
exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and
generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper
presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines
physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system
stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode
decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from
phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as
modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and
spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal
dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly
within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving
dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE
9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance,
achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively,
surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning
algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal
combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without
performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for
small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across
different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while
providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it
suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.

*Patrik Valábek,Michaela Horváthová,Martin Klaučo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) method for optimizing the efficiency of a pasteurization unit, achieving enhanced prediction accuracy and reduced economic costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving efficient and accurate control in nonlinear and complex systems, specifically in a thermal-intensive pasteurization unit.

Method: A deep Koopman model, using neural networks, transforms nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation for easier and better optimization in an EMPC framework, incorporating economic costs like energy use and material losses.

Result: The deep Koopman-based EMPC improves open-loop prediction accuracy by 45% over conventional N4SID models and reduces total economic cost by 32%, using 10.2% less electrical energy in steady-state operation.

Conclusion: The integration of deep Koopman representations with economic optimization significantly enhances resource efficiency, energy savings, and overall operational effectiveness in controlling nonlinear systems like pasteurization units.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control
(EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU).
The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear
system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of
convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep
Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from
experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy
over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were
employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs,
such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization,
and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables.
The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear
model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include
feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be
pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a
32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This
improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy
consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC
requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical
advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic
optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.

*Patrik Valábek,Marek Wadinger,Michal Kvasnica,Martin Klaučo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model for nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays, achieving better prediction accuracy without requiring predefined dictionaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear systems with input delays challenge traditional control methods, requiring innovative solutions for prediction, estimation, and control.

Method: The authors use LSTM layers within a Deep Koopman model to approximate the Koopman operator, avoiding the need for pre-defined dictionaries and encoding delayed dynamics into a latent space.

Result: The proposed model achieved significant performance improvements in prediction accuracy compared to extended eDMD, especially when true dynamics are unknown.

Conclusion: The LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model provides a robust alternative to traditional methods for handling nonlinear systems with input delays, simplifying dictionary dependencies and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for
prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the
impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques
often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper
introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an
LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear
systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently
encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional
extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined
dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which
mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and
incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD
on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in
prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and
achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.

*Giorgio Palma,Andrea Serani,Matteo Diez*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The study develops an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for precise seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, revealing FHDMDc as the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for accurate seakeeping predictions of vessels under uncertain conditions to support design and operational decisions.

Method: Experimental wave basin tests on a scale model were conducted under sea state 5; HDMDc approaches—Bayesian (BHDMDc) and Frequentist (FHDMDc)—were compared for prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: FHDMDc outperformed deterministic models providing better accuracy and robust uncertainty estimation, while BHDMDc showed limited benefits for the given test case.

Conclusion: FHDMDc ensures reliable and efficient seakeeping predictions, closely matching experimental and URANS data, making it suitable for vessel design and operations.

Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions
of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental
measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of
gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge
acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin
tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5
conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test
sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order
model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their
time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling
strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters
considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior
mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which
aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing
seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is
found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic
counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the
application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in
comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density
functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS
results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping
prediction for design and operational support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for

systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an
expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of
the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep
understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based
systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available
closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable
of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these
systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual

*Valter Uotila,Väinö Mehtola,Ilmo Salmenperä,Bo Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of symmetrization in quantum machine learning (QML) ansatzes, analyzing how varying degrees of symmetry influence performance metrics like expressibility and entangling capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the practical implications of symmetrization in QML, such as gate overhead and reduced expressibility, which are not well explored yet, to improve the design of efficient and effective quantum algorithms.

Method: The authors develop an automated pipeline to analyze common QML ansatzes against different levels of symmetries, defined via subgroups. They compute metrics like generator differences, circuit depth and size, as well as expressibility and entangling capability to assess performance.

Result: Findings reveal that symmetrization leads to varying gate overheads across ansatzes, reduces expressibility but often increases entangling capability. These results vary depending on the degree of symmetry applied.

Conclusion: These insights facilitate the selection of ansatz patterns that balance expressibility and computational efficiency, aiding the design of quantum algorithms for geometric quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

*Phuc Nguyen,Josiah Couch,Rahul Bansal,Alexandra Morgan,Chris Tam,Miao Li,Rima Arnaout,Ramy Arnaout*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper compares two entropy measures, "Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve" (LCR) and "Vendi score" (VS), on their ability to capture system similarity sensitivity, showing that they differ in performance and provide complementary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how similarity-sensitive entropy measures compare and provide insights into their application for accurately capturing system information.

Method: The authors use a conceptual, analytical, and experimental approach, analyzing 53 machine-learning datasets and investigating scaling, introducing the "half distance" concept, alongside proving mathematical bounds and discussing special cases.

Result: LCR and VS differ greatly, but they capture complementary information about system similarities. VS provides an upper bound for several scenarios, while LCR is favored for broadly capturing similarity information.

Conclusion: LCR is optimal in most scenarios for capturing similarity-rich information, while VS is preferable in specific cases, such as quantum-mechanical systems or interpreting elements as combinations of more fundamental units. The two methods can complement each other under certain conditions.

Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon
entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information
encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,
and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information
encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding
similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was
introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,
and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,
analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show
that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary
information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both
LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of
``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an
upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and
conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is
preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more
fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a
quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks
simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;
nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each
other.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF), which extends simulation-based Bayesian computation to dynamic settings using deep neural networks. GBF enables posterior inference in state-space models without explicit density evaluations, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an accurate and robust inference approach for complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models, especially when the observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable.

Method: The authors propose a Generative Bayesian Filtering framework that applies Generative Bayesian Computation to dynamic models, enhanced by deep neural networks. They introduce a Generative-Gibbs sampler that iteratively samples variables from their implicit full conditional distributions.

Result: The study shows that GBF outperforms existing likelihood-free approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in both simulation and empirical studies of state-space models, including $alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models.

Conclusion: GBF is a powerful tool for posterior inference in intractable state-space models, providing significant advancements in accuracy and robustness while eliminating the need for explicit density evaluations.

Abstract: Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible
framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and
non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian
Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference
using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not
require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when
observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To
address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which
bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from
its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly
applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with
intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance
of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies,
including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our
findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free
approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space
models.

### [343] [Geometric Decomposition of Statistical Inference through Gradient Flow and Co-Monotonicity Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04599)

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data, proposing a novel geometric decomposition framework for localized analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often have context-dependent relationships that vary across subpopulations, making global association methods insufficient for understanding complex patterns.

Method: The framework uses two strategies: gradient flow decomposition (partitioning samples into monotonic basins) and co-monotonicity decomposition (embedding samples into association space based on vertex-level coefficients and biclustering on Riemannian graphs).

Result: The proposed methods enable localized inference and extend to multi-modal data integration, enhancing statistical power and interpretability.

Conclusion: This geometric decomposition approach facilitates better feature-outcome association analysis across diverse and complex datasets.

Abstract: Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns,
reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into basins where outcomes exhibit monotonic behavior.
  Co-monotonicity decomposition leverages association structure: vertex-level
  coefficients measuring directional concordance between outcome and features,
  or between feature pairs, define embeddings of samples into association
space.
  These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which biclustering
  identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature modules. This
  extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple feature sets.
  Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian posterior
  sampling providing credible intervals.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an integrative downscaling framework using advanced deep learning models to provide high-resolution temperature projections for northern Europe. Results highlight significant temperature changes and the urgent need for adaptation measures under climate change scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for high-resolution projected temperatures to support regional planning and adaptation in northern Europe's varied climate regions due to rapid climatic changes and increased variability.

Method: The researchers developed a downscaling framework combining Vision Transformer (ViT), ConvLSTM, and GeoStaNet models, evaluated using a multicriteria decision system, DL-TOPSIS, along with bias-corrected and validated climate data from NorESM2-LM CMIP6 outputs.

Result: The framework delivered reliable downscaled projections with the ViT achieving high performance (RMSE: 1.01°C; R^2: 0.92). Under SSP5-8.5 scenario, projections indicate significant temperature increases by 2100 in subarctic (4.8°C) and warm-summer continental zones (3.9°C), with diurnal temperature range expanding by more than 1.5°C.

Conclusion: The new framework provides high-resolution station-based temperature projections and uncertainty estimates, enabling actionable insights for adaptation policies in northern Europe's rapidly changing climate regions.

Abstract: Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied
Koppen-Geiger regions of northern Europe generate significant needs for
adaptation. Regional planning needs high-resolution projected temperatures.
This work presents an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates
Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and
Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware
Network (GeoStaNet) models. The framework is evaluated with a multicriteria
decision system, Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS), for ten strategically chosen
meteorological stations encompassing the temperate oceanic (Cfb), subpolar
oceanic (Cfc), warm-summer continental (Dfb), and subarctic (Dfc) climate
regions. Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected during the
1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations of
day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed
improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2:
0.92), allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the
SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Dfc and Dfb climate zones are projected to warm by 4.8
degrees C and 3.9 degrees C, respectively, by 2100, with expansion in the
diurnal temperature range by more than 1.5 degrees C. The Time of Emergence
signal first appears in subarctic winter seasons (Dfc: approximately 2032),
signifying an urgent need for adaptation measures. The presented framework
offers station-based, high-resolution estimates of uncertainties and extremes,
with direct uses for adaptation policy over high-latitude regions with fast
environmental change.

*Ali Boudaghi,Hadi Zare*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MusRec, a zero-shot text-to-music editing model that enables diverse and efficient editing of real-world music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for music editing are limited by their inability to handle real-world music without retraining, reliance on precise prompts, and restricted to synthesized music. There is a need for versatile zero-shot music editing capabilities.

Method: The authors utilize advanced techniques in rectified flow and diffusion transformers to develop the MusRec model, designed to edit music based on text prompts without retraining.

Result: MusRec demonstrates superior performance over current methods by preserving musical content, maintaining structural consistency, and ensuring high editing fidelity across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: MusRec lays a strong foundation for controlled and efficient music editing in real-world applications, significantly advancing the field.

Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial
intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music
production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences.
However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted
to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly
precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true
zero-shot capability. Leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and
diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music
editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music
efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural
consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for
controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.

### [347] [Online Algorithms for Repeated Optimal Stopping: Achieving Both Competitive Ratio and Regret Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04484)
*Tsubasa Harada,Yasushi Kawase,Hanna Sumita*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for solving repeated optimal stopping problems, achieving sublinear regret while guaranteeing competitive ratios in each round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address repeated optimal stopping problems where decisions must be made multiple times with unknown distributions, and to balance competitive performance and regret minimization.

Method: A dynamic algorithm selecting between empirically optimal strategies based on past observations and sample-based approaches with competitive guarantees.

Result: The algorithm guarantees performance as good as the baseline sample-based method in every round with a bounded total regret of ~$O(sqrt(T))$. It is applied to problems like the prophet inequality and secretary problem, showing broad utility and near-optimal regret performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles repeated optimal stopping problems, achieving simultaneous competitive ratios and sublinear regret, demonstrating theoretical near-optimality.

Abstract: We study the repeated optimal stopping problem, which generalizes the
classical optimal stopping problem with an unknown distribution to a setting
where the same problem is solved repeatedly over $T$ rounds. In this framework,
we aim to design algorithms that guarantee a competitive ratio in each round
while also achieving sublinear regret across all rounds.
  Our primary contribution is a general algorithmic framework that achieves
these objectives simultaneously for a wide array of repeated optimal stopping
problems. The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round,
choosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived
from the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a
proven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an
algorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in
every round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.
  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical
problems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their
variants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for
the repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a
$1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret. Furthermore, we establish a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
even in the i.i.d. model, confirming that our algorithm's performance is almost
optimal with respect to the number of rounds.

### [348] [An Automated Theorem Generator with Theoretical Foundation Based on Rectangular Standard Contradiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04092)
*Yang Xu,Peiyao Liu,Shuwei Chen,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel automated theorem generation theory and tool based on a structure called rectangular standard contradiction, facilitating rigorous theorem synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for theorem generation lack a systematic and theoretical framework. There is a pressing need for a rigorous methodology to automatically generate logical theorems.

Method: The authors defined a novel logical structure termed 'rectangular standard contradiction' with key properties and devised a complete automated theorem generation (ATG) theory and an efficient template-based ATG algorithm.

Result: The study proves the essential characteristics of the rectangular standard contradiction, creates a valid theorem generation framework, and develops the Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator.

Conclusion: This research transitions machine functioning from verification to discovery, providing a significant advancement in automated reasoning, with implications for logic and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Currently, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical system for systematically
generating non-trivial and logically valid theorems. Addressing this critical
gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem
generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction
which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for
the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard
contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem
Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core
properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard
contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy
(the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause).
Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular
standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement
$H$, a valid theorem $A \vdash \neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are
logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG
algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is
developed. This research enables machines to transition from "verifiers" to
"discoverers", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of
logic and artificial intelligence.

*Michael Ludkovski,Changgen Xie,Zimu Zhu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning approach for solving principal-agent problems in continuous time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to effectively address multi-dimensional principal-agent problems using advanced computational methods.

Method: Development of a novel deep learning algorithm called Deep Principal-Agent Actor Critic (DeepPAAC) to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with implicit Hamiltonians.

Result: DeepPAAC is shown to handle multi-dimensional states, controls, and constraints successfully, validated through five case studies.

Conclusion: DeepPAAC is a promising computational tool for resolving complex principal-agent problems in continuous time.

Abstract: We consider numerical resolution of principal-agent (PA) problems in
continuous time. We formulate a generic PA model with continuous and lump
payments and a multi-dimensional strategy of the agent. To tackle the resulting
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an implicit Hamiltonian we develop a
novel deep learning method: the Deep Principal-Agent Actor Critic (DeepPAAC)
Actor-Critic algorithm. DeepPAAC is able to handle multi-dimensional states and
controls, as well as constraints. We investigate the role of the neural network
architecture, training designs, loss functions, etc. on the convergence of the
solver, presenting five different case studies.

### [350] [Climbing the label tree: Hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning for medical imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03771)
*Alif Elham Khan*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework for medical image representations, improving taxonomy alignment and performance over existing self-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image labels are structured hierarchically in taxonomies, which is largely ignored in standard self-supervised learning methods. This paper aims to develop a framework that better respects and utilizes this hierarchical structure to enhance performance and interpretability.

Method: The approach involves two objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which adjusts pair strengths based on shared ancestors, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), which separates ancestor groups across hierarchy levels. These objectives are geometry-agnostic, adaptable to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings, and require no architectural changes.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms strong self-supervised learning baselines across benchmarks in medical domains (e.g., breast histopathology). Metrics tailored to hierarchy faithfulness (HF1, H-Acc, etc.) demonstrate the improved taxonomy alignment of learned representations.

Conclusion: This study introduces a general framework to enhance representation learning in hierarchy-rich domains like medical imaging. It improves both taxonomy alignment and interpretability, providing a practical solution for leveraging label hierarchies in self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.

### [351] [CORE - A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03826)
*Esha Sadia Nasir,Behnaz Elhaminia,Mark Eastwood,Catherine King,Owen Cain,Lorraine Harper,Paul Moss,Dimitrios Chanouzas,David Snead,Nasir Rajpoot,Adam Shephard,Shan E Ahmed Raza*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORE, a framework for precise nuclei-level registration in multi-stained tissue Whole Slide Images (WSIs), achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of nuclei-level registration in multi-stained WSIs to enable detailed tissue analysis across diverse imaging modalities.

Method: The proposed CORE framework uses a coarse-to-fine strategy: coarse registration with tissue mask extraction and feature matching, followed by fine-grained point-set registration and non-rigid alignment using Coherent Point Drift (CPD).

Result: CORE demonstrates superior performance in generalisability, precision, and robustness across five datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CORE is effective as a robust nuclei-level registration framework across modalities, with significant potential for application in multi-stained WSI analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential
for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We
propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level
registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The
coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to
effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global
alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with
a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei
centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a
custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment
at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement
field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from
automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable
registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across
modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI
registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and
robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs
